- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The purpose of this document is to document the IETF consensus\
    \ on\n   security requirements for protocols as well as to provide the\n   background\
    \ and motivation for them.\n   The Internet is a global network of independently\
    \ managed networks\n   and hosts.  As such there is no central authority responsible\
    \ for the\n   operation of the network.  There is no central authority responsible\n\
    \   for the provision of security across the network either.\n   Security needs\
    \ to be provided end-to-end or host to host.  The IETF's\n   security role is\
    \ to ensure that IETF standard protocols have the\n   necessary features to provide\
    \ appropriate security for the\n   application as it may be used across the Internet.\
    \  Mandatory to\n   implement mechanisms should provide adequate security to protect\n\
    \   sensitive business applications.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   Although we are not defining a protocol standard in this\
    \ document we\n   will use the terms MUST, MAY, SHOULD and friends in the ways\
    \ defined\n   by [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Security Services
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Services\n   [RFC2828] provides a comprehensive listing of internetwork\
    \ security\n   services and their definitions.  Here are three essential\n   definitions:\n\
    \   * Authentication service:  A security service that verifies an\n     identity\
    \ claimed by or for an entity, be it a process, computer\n     system, or person.\
    \  At the internetwork layer, this includes\n     verifying that a datagram came\
    \ from where it purports to originate.\n     At the application layer, this includes\
    \ verifying that the entity\n     performing an operation is who it claims to\
    \ be.\n   * Data confidentiality service:  A security service that protects\n\
    \     data against unauthorized disclosure to unauthorized individuals or\n  \
    \   processes.  (Internet Standards Documents SHOULD NOT use \"data\n     confidentiality\"\
    \ as a synonym for \"privacy\", which is a different\n     concept.  Privacy refers\
    \ to the right of an entity, normally a\n     person, acting in its own behalf,\
    \ to determine the degree to which\n     it will interact with its environment,\
    \ including the degree to\n     which the entity is willing to share information\
    \ about itself with\n     others.)\n   * Data integrity service: A security service\
    \ that protects against\n     unauthorized changes to data, including both intentional\
    \ change\n     (including destruction) and accidental change (including loss),\
    \ by\n     ensuring that changes to data are detectable.\n"
- title: 4.  Some Properties of the Internet
  contents:
  - "4.  Some Properties of the Internet\n   As mentioned earlier, the Internet provides\
    \ no inherent security.\n   Enclaves of networking exist where users believe that\
    \ security is\n   provided by the environment itself.  An example would be a company\n\
    \   network not connected to the global Internet.\n   One might imagine that protocols\
    \ designed to operate in such an\n   enclave would not require any security services,\
    \ as the security is\n   provided by the environment.\n   History has shown that\
    \ applications that operate using the TCP/IP\n   Protocol Suite wind up being\
    \ used over the Internet.  This is true\n   even when the original application\
    \ was not envisioned to be used in a\n   \"wide area\" Internet environment. \
    \ If an application isn't designed\n   to provide security, users of the application\
    \ discover that they are\n   vulnerable to attack.\n"
- title: 5.  IETF Security Technology
  contents:
  - "5.  IETF Security Technology\n   The IETF has several security protocols and\
    \ standards.  IP Security\n   (IPsec [RFC2411]), Transport Layer Security (TLS\
    \ [RFC2246]) are two\n   well known protocols.  Simple Authentication and Security\
    \ Layer (SASL\n   [RFC2222] and the Generic Security Service Application Programming\n\
    \   Interface (GSSAPI [RFC2743]) provide services within the context of a\n  \
    \ \"host\" protocol.  They can be viewed as \"toolkits\" to use within\n   another\
    \ protocol.\n   One of the critical choices that a protocol designer must make\
    \ is\n   whether to make use of one of the existing protocols, engineer their\n\
    \   own protocol to use one of the standard tools or do something\n   completely\
    \ different.\n   There is no one correct answer for all protocols and designers\
    \ really\n   need to look at the threats to their own protocol and design\n  \
    \ appropriate counter-measures.  The purpose of the \"Security\n   Considerations\"\
    \ Section required to be present in an RFC on the\n   Internet Standards Track\
    \ is to provide a place for protocol designers\n   to document the threats and\
    \ explain the logic to their security\n   design.\n"
- title: 6.  The Danvers Doctrine
  contents:
  - "6.  The Danvers Doctrine\n   At the 32cd IETF held in Danvers, Massachusetts\
    \ during April of 1995\n   the IESG asked the plenary for a consensus on the strength\
    \ of\n   security that should be provided by IETF standards.  Although the\n \
    \  immediate issue before the IETF was whether or not to support\n   \"export\"\
    \ grade security (which is to say weak security) in standards\n   the question\
    \ raised the generic issue of security in general.\n   The overwhelming consensus\
    \ was that the IETF should standardize on\n   the use of the best security available,\
    \ regardless of national\n   policies.  This consensus is often referred to as\
    \ the \"Danvers\n   Doctrine\".\n   Over time we have extended the interpretation\
    \ of the Danvers Doctrine\n   to imply that all IETF protocols should operate\
    \ securely.  How can\n   one argue against this?\n   Since 1995 the Internet has\
    \ increasingly come under attack from\n   various malicious actors.  In 2000 significant\
    \ press coverage was\n   devoted to Distributed Denial of Service attacks.  However\
    \ many of\n   these attacks were launched by first compromising an Internet\n\
    \   connected computer system.  Usually many systems are compromised in\n   order\
    \ to launch a significant distributed attack.\n   A conclusion we can draw from\
    \ all of this is that if we fail to\n   provide secure protocols, then the Internet\
    \ will become less useful\n   in providing an international communications infrastructure,\
    \ which\n   appears to be its destiny.\n   One of the continuing arguments we\
    \ hear against building security\n   into protocols is the argument that a given\
    \ protocol is intended only\n   for use in \"protected\" environments where security\
    \ will not be an\n   issue.\n   However it is very hard to predict how a protocol\
    \ will be used in the\n   future.  What may be intended only for a restricted\
    \ environment may\n   well wind up being deployed in the global Internet.  We\
    \ cannot wait\n   until that point to \"fix\" security problems.  By the time\
    \ we realize\n   this deployment, it is too late.\n   The solution is that we\
    \ MUST implement strong security in all\n   protocols to provide for the all too\
    \ frequent day when the protocol\n   comes into widespread use in the global Internet.\n"
- title: 7.  MUST is for Implementors
  contents:
  - "7.  MUST is for Implementors\n   We often say that Security is a MUST implement.\
    \  It is worth noting\n   that there is a significant different between MUST implement\
    \ and MUST\n   use.\n   As mentioned earlier, some protocols may be deployed in\
    \ secure\n   enclaves for which security isn't an issue and security protocol\n\
    \   processing may add a significant performance degradation.  Therefore\n   it\
    \ is completely reasonable for security features to be an option\n   that the\
    \ end user of the protocol may choose to disable.  Note that\n   we are using\
    \ a fuzzy definition of \"end user\" here.  We mean not only\n   the ultimate\
    \ end user, but any deployer of a technology, which may be\n   an entire enterprise.\n\
    \   However security must be a MUST IMPLEMENT so that end users will have\n  \
    \ the option of enabling it when the situation calls for it.\n"
- title: 8.  Is Encryption a MUST?
  contents:
  - "8.  Is Encryption a MUST?\n   Not necessarily.  However we need to be a bit more\
    \ precise here.\n   Exactly what security services are appropriate for a given\
    \ protocol\n   depends heavily on the application it is implementing.  Many people\n\
    \   assume that encryption means confidentiality.  In other words the\n   encryption\
    \ of the content of protocol messages.\n   However there are many applications\
    \ where confidentiality is not a\n   requirement, but authentication and integrity\
    \ are.\n   One example might be in a building control application where we are\n\
    \   using IP technology to operate heat and vent controls.  There is\n   likely\
    \ no requirement to protect the confidentiality of messages that\n   instruct\
    \ heat vents to open and close.  However authentication and\n   integrity are\
    \ likely important if we are to protect the building from\n   a malicious actor\
    \ raising or lowering the temperature at will.\n   Yet we often require cryptographic\
    \ technology to implement\n   authentication and integrity of protocol messages.\
    \  So if the\n   question is \"MUST we implement confidentiality?\" the answer\
    \ will be\n   \"depends\".  However if the question is \"MUST we make use of\n\
    \   cryptographic technology?\" the answer is \"likely\".\n"
- title: 9.  Crypto Seems to Have a Bad Name
  contents:
  - "9.  Crypto Seems to Have a Bad Name\n   The mention of cryptographic technology\
    \ in many IETF forums causes\n   eyes to glaze over and resistance to increase.\n\
    \   Many people seem to associate the word \"cryptography\" with concerns\n  \
    \ such as export control and performance.  Some just plain do not\n   understand\
    \ it and therefore shy away from its use.  However many of\n   these concerns\
    \ are unfounded.\n   Today export control, at least from most of the developed\
    \ world, is\n   becoming less of a concern.  And even where it is a concern, the\n\
    \   concern is not over cryptography itself but in its use in providing\n   confidentiality.\n\
    \   There are performance issues when you make use of cryptographic\n   technology.\
    \  However we pride ourselves in the IETF as being\n   engineers.  It is an engineering\
    \ exercise to figure out the\n   appropriate way to make use of cryptographic\
    \ technology so as to\n   eliminate or at least minimize the impact of using cryptography\n\
    \   within a given protocol.\n   Finally, as to understanding cryptography, you\
    \ don't have to.  In\n   other words, you do not need to become a cryptographer\
    \ in order to\n   effectively make use of cryptographic technology.  Instead you\
    \ make\n   use of existing well understood ciphers and cipher suites to solve\n\
    \   the engineering problem you face.\n   One of the goals that we have in the\
    \ Security Area of the IETF is to\n   come up with guides so that protocol implementers\
    \ can choose\n   appropriate technology without having to understand the minutiae.\n"
