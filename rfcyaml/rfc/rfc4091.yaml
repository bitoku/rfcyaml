  - "1.  Introduction\n   A Session Description Protocol (SDP) [2] session description\
    \ contains\n   the media parameters to be used in establishing a number of media\n\
    \   streams.  For a particular media stream, an SDP session description\n   contains,\
    \ among other parameters, the network addresses and the codec\n   to be used in\
    \ transferring media.  SDP allows for a set of codecs per\n   media stream, but\
    \ only one network address.\n   The ability to offer a set of network addresses\
    \ to establish a media\n   stream is useful in environments with both IPv4-only\
    \ hosts and\n   IPv6-only hosts, for instance.\n   This document defines the Alternative\
    \ Network Address Types (ANAT)\n   semantics for the SDP grouping framework [4].\
    \  The ANAT semantics\n   allow for the expression of alternative network addresses\
    \ (e.g.,\n   different IP versions) for a particular media stream.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Scope and Relation with Interactive Connectivity Establishment
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope and Relation with Interactive Connectivity Establishment\n   The\
    \ ANAT semantics are intended to address scenarios that involve\n   different\
    \ network address types (e.g., different IP versions).  They\n   are not intended\
    \ to provide alternative transport addresses with the\n   same network type. \
    \ Systems that need to provide different transport\n   addresses with the same\
    \ network type should use the SDP format\n   defined in ICE (Interactive Connectivity\
    \ Establishment) [6] instead.\n   ICE is used by systems that cannot determine\
    \ their own transport\n   address as seen from the remote end, but that can provide\
    \ several\n   possible alternatives.  ICE encodes the address that is most likely\n\
    \   to be valid in an 'm' line, and the rest of addresses as a= lines\n   after\
    \ that 'm' line.  This way, systems that do not support ICE\n   simply ignore\
    \ the a= lines and only use the address in the 'm' line.\n   This achieves good\
    \ backward compatibility.\n   We have chosen to group 'm' lines with different\
    \ IP versions at the\n   'm' level (ANAT semantics) rather than at the a= level\
    \ (ICE format)\n   in order to keep the IPv6 syntax free from ICE parameters used\
    \ for\n   legacy (IPv4) NATs (Network Address Translators).  This yields a\n \
    \  syntax much closer to vanilla SDP, where IPv6 addresses are defined\n   in\
    \ their own 'm' line, rather than in parameters belonging to a\n   different 'm'\
    \ line.\n   Additionally, ICE only allows us to provide a single primary address\n\
    \   when the peer does not support ICE.  The ANAT semantics avoid\n   relegating\
    \ certain types of addresses (e.g., IPv6 addresses) to only\n   be a secondary\
    \ alternate to another address type (e.g., IPv4\n   addresses).\n   Furthermore,\
    \ the separation between ANAT and ICE helps systems that\n   support IPv4 and\
    \ IPv6 but that do not need to support ICE (e.g., a\n   multicast server).\n"

    REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"NOT\n   RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as\n\

- title: 3.  ANAT Semantics
  contents:
  - "3.  ANAT Semantics\n   We define a new \"semantics\" attribute within the SDP\
    \ grouping\n   framework [4]: ANAT (Alternative Network Address Types).\n   Media\
    \ lines grouped using ANAT semantics provide alternative network\n   addresses\
    \ of different types for a single logical media stream.  The\n   entity creating\
    \ a session description with an ANAT group MUST be\n   ready to receive (or send)\
    \ media over any of the grouped 'm' lines.\n   The ANAT semantics MUST NOT be\
    \ used to group media streams whose\n   network addresses are of the same type.\n"
- title: 4.  Preference
  contents:
  - "4.  Preference\n   The entity generating a session description may have an order\
    \ of\n   preference for the alternative network address types offered.  The\n\
    \   identifiers of the media streams MUST be listed in order of\n   preference\
    \ in the group line.  For example, in the session\n   description in Section 6,\
    \ the 'm' line with mid=1 has a higher\n   preference than the 'm' line with mid=2.\n"
- title: 5.  Offer/Answer and ANAT
  contents:
  - "5.  Offer/Answer and ANAT\n   An offerer using SIP [3] to send its offer SHOULD\
    \ place the sdp-anat\n   option-tag [5] in a Require header field.\n   An answerer\
    \ receiving a session description that uses the ANAT\n   semantics SHOULD use\
    \ the address with the highest priority it\n   understands and set the ports of\
    \ the rest of the 'm' lines of the\n   group to zero.\n"
- title: 6.  Example
  contents:
  - "6.  Example\n   The session description below contains an IPv4 address and an\
    \ IPv6\n   address grouped using ANAT.  The format corresponding to the mapping\n\
    \   of ICE into SDP [6] can be used in both 'm' lines to provide\n   additional\
    \ addresses.\n      v=0\n      o=bob 280744730 28977631 IN IP4 host.example.com\n\

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   An attacker adding group lines, using the ANAT\
    \ semantics, to an SDP\n   session description could make an end-point use only\
    \ one out of all\n   the streams offered by the remote end, when the intention\
    \ of the\n   remote-end might have been to establish all the streams.\n   An attacker\
    \ removing group lines using ANAT semantics could make an\n   end-point establish\
    \ a higher number of media streams.  If the\n   end-point sends media over all\
    \ of them, the session bandwidth may\n   increase dramatically.\n   It is thus\
    \ strongly RECOMMENDED that integrity protection be applied\n   to the SDP session\
    \ descriptions.  For session descriptions carried in\n   SIP [3], S/MIME is the\
    \ natural choice to provide such end-to-end\n   integrity protection, as described\
    \ in RFC 3261 [3].  Other\n   applications MAY use a different form of integrity\
    \ protection.\n"
