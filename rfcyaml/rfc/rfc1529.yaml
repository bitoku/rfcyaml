  - "Introduction\n   This document defines the administrative policies for the operation\n\
    \   of remote printer facilities within the context of the tpc.int\n   subdomain.\
    \  The document describes different approaches to resource\n   recovery for remote\
    \ printer server sites and includes discussions of\n   issues pertaining to auditing,\
    \ security, and denial of access.\n   The technical procedures for remote printing\
    \ are defined in [1]. The\n   general principles of operation for the tpc.int\
    \ subdomain are defined\n   in [2].  An overview of the remote printing facility\
    \ is returned when\n   electronic mail is sent to tpc-faq@town.hall.org.\n"
- title: Overview of Remote Printing in the TPC.INT Subdomain
  contents:
  - "Overview of Remote Printing in the TPC.INT Subdomain\n   The remote printing\
    \ facility allows a user to image documents on a\n   remote printer, defined as\
    \ a G3-compatible facsimile device connected\n   to the public telephone network.\
    \  The user sends electronic mail to\n   an address which includes the phone number\
    \ associated with the target\n   G3-compatible facsimile device.  Using the Domain\
    \ Name System, the\n   Internet message-handling infrastructure routes the message\
    \ to a\n   remote printer server, which provides access to devices within a\n\
    \   specified range of the telephone system numbering plan.  The message\n   is\
    \ imaged on the target remote printer and an acknowledgement is sent\n   back\
    \ to the initiator of the message.\n   The remote printing facility is concerned\
    \ with outreach, integrating\n   the e-mail and G3-compatible facsimile communities\
    \ into a common\n   communications environment. By providing easy access to remote\n\
    \   printing recipients, enterprise-wide access is enhanced, regardless\n   of\
    \ the kind of institution (e.g., commercial, educational, or\n   government),\
    \ or the size of institution (e.g., global, regional, or\n   local).  Remote printing\
    \ allows an organization to make it easier for\n   electronic mail users to communicate\
    \ with the personnel in the\n   organization who are users of G3-compatible facsimile\
    \ but not e-mail,\n   providing a valuable bridge between the two types of technology.\n"
- title: Models of Operation for Remote Printing Servers
  contents:
  - "Models of Operation for Remote Printing Servers\n   Remote printer servers in\
    \ the tpc.int subdomain consume resources\n   that are typically recovered from\
    \ neither the initiator nor the\n   recipient of the remote printing service.\
    \  Owing to a lack of\n   widespread authentication facilities in the Internet\
    \ and connected\n   message handling domains, it is not currently possible to\
    \ identify\n   the initiator with certainty.  Since the request was not initiated\
    \ by\n   the recipient, it is inappropriate for a remote printer gateway to\n\
    \   accept a request and then attempt to charge the receiver of the\n   message\
    \ before imaging the document on the remote printer.\n   Several models of resource\
    \ recovery for remote printer operation are\n   possible in the tpc.int subdomain:\n\
    \      Community Library Model\n      Neighborhood Grocery Model\n      Local\
    \ Newspaper Model\n   In the Community Library model, an organization would register\
    \ a\n   remote printer gateway willing to place calls to all devices located\n\
    \   within the organization's telephone system.  Other operators may\n   determine\
    \ that the costs of servicing the immediate vicinity (or even\n   a larger area)\
    \ are minimal and register to serve a portion of the\n   telephone address space\
    \ as a community service.\n   The Community Library model can apply to a neighborhood,\
    \ or to an\n   organization such as a government R&D Center, a university, or\
    \ a\n   corporation.  The library model does not recover costs from the\n   particpants,\
    \ but runs the remote printer as a community service.\n   In the Neighborhood\
    \ Grocery model, a commercial organization\n   contracts with specific end users,\
    \ offering to register their\n   individual fax numbers in the namespace.  This\
    \ service bureau model\n   could be conducted with or without cost recovery from\
    \ the owner of\n   the remote printer device.\n   The Local Newspaper model recovers\
    \ the resources needed to operate\n   the remote printer service from a third\
    \ party not directly connected\n   with the message exchange. When a document\
    \ is successfully imaged on\n   a remote printer, there are two actions that result.\
    \  First, a cover\n   sheet is constructed and prepended to the document imaged\
    \ on the\n   remote printer.  Second, a notification is sent back to the\n   initiator.\
    \  An Internet site running a remote printer server\n   registered in the tpc.int\
    \ subdomain is permitted to acknowledge a\n   sponsor in both cases.\n   Specifically,\
    \ up to one-third of the area of the cover sheet may be\n   used for acknowledgement\
    \ of the sponsor, and up to 250 bytes of ASCII\n   text acknowledging the sponsor\
    \ may be appended to the notification\n   returned to the initiator.   Any such\
    \ sponsor acknowledgement is\n   subject to applicable regulations governing the\
    \ content and form of\n   such acknowledgements.\n   The words \"paid advertisement\"\
    \ should be prominently displayed in the\n   area containing the message if money\
    \ has changed hands for the\n   transaction.  If an organization uses the local\
    \ newspaper model\n   simply to transmit community service messages, then the\
    \ words \"paid\n   advertisement\" need not be displayed.\n"
- title: Auditing and Security
  contents:
  - "Auditing and Security\n   A remote printer server should maintain a log for auditing\
    \ and\n   security.  This log may contain at most the following information:\n\
    \      1) the date the message was received;\n      2) the \"From\" and \"Message-ID\"\
    \ fields;\n      3) the size of the body;\n      4) the identity (telephone number)\
    \ of the printer;\n      5) any telephony-related information, such as call\n\
    \         duration;\n      6) any G3-related information, such recipient ID.\n\
    \   This information is the most that can be kept and may be further\n   limited\
    \ by legal authority with jurisdiction at the site.\n   The purpose of the log\
    \ is to maintain accountability and security.\n   It is considered a violation\
    \ of the privacy of the initiator and the\n   recipient of the remote printer\
    \ services to divulge such logs unless\n   required by legal authority with jurisdiction\
    \ at the site.  In\n   particular, it is a violation of privacy to divulge, either\
    \ directly\n   or indirectly, such information for the compilation of lists for\n\
    \   marketing purposes.\n   It is permissible, however, to furnish interested\
    \ parties with\n   summary reports that indicate the number of calls, average\
    \ length,\n   and other summary information provided that such summary information\n\
    \   could not be used to identify individual initiators or recipients or\n   their\
    \ calling patterns.  For example, a remote printer gateway might\n   furnish an\
    \ interested party with a report of the number of calls per\n   day and hours\
    \ logged to a specific local area exchange.\n   Remote printer servers operate\
    \ in a public service capacity and must\n   strictly respect the privacy of the\
    \ contents of messages. Unless\n   required by technical or legal considerations,\
    \ the content of\n   messages shall not be monitored or disclosed.\n"
- title: Denial of Access
  contents:
  - "Denial of Access\n   Internet sites registered in the tpc.int subdomain may deny\
    \ access\n   based on the source but not the destination of the message.  If an\n\
    \   Internet site feels that it is inappropriate to provide access to a\n   particular\
    \ destination, then it should re-register itself\n   accordingly.\n   Denial of\
    \ access based on source should be made only if required by\n   legal authority\
    \ with jurisdiction at the site or because of abuse.\n   In all cases, denial\
    \ of access should result in a notification\n   returned to the initiator indicating\
    \ the policy that was violated.\n   However, if repeated attempts continue to\
    \ be made by the source,\n   repeated notifications are not necessary.  Denial\
    \ of access should be\n   distinguished from the inability to provide access.\
    \  For example,\n   improperly formatted messages will prevent access.\n   Denial\
    \ of access can occur due to problems in a single message or set\n   of messages\
    \ or because of consistent patterns of abuse. Examples of\n   denial on a single\
    \ message might include an attempt to transmit an\n   extremely long document,\
    \ such as a 100-page memo. Such a document\n   might violate local policies limiting\
    \ the number of pages or\n   transmission time.\n   A more serious problem is\
    \ long-term abuse of facilities.  A remote\n   printer server might choose to\
    \ impose a usage limit on a daily or\n   monthly basis.  Such limits should be\
    \ chosen to balance the desire to\n   encourage legitimate users with the need\
    \ to prevent consistent abuse.\n   At present, it is the responsibility for each\
    \ Internet site running a\n   remote printer server to define a local policy for\
    \ denial of access.\n   This policy should be based on objective criteria, and\
    \ those criteria\n   should be registered with the tpc.int subdomain secretariat\
    \ at the\n   e-mail address tpc-admin@town.hall.org.\n"
