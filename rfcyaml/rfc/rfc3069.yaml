  - "Abstract\n   This document introduces the concept of Virtual Local Area Network\n\
    \   (VLAN) aggregation as it relates to IPv4 address allocation.  A\n   mechanism\
    \ is described by which hosts that reside in the same\n   physical switched infrastructure,\
    \ but separate virtual broadcast\n   domains, are addressed from the same IPv4\
    \ subnet and share a common\n   default gateway IP address, thereby removing the\
    \ requirement of a\n   dedicated IP subnet for each virtual Local Area Network\
    \ (LAN) or\n   Metropolitan Area Network (MAN).\n   Employing such a mechanism\
    \ significantly decreases IPv4 address\n   consumption in virtual LANs and MANs.\
    \  It may also ease\n   administration of IPv4 addresses within the network.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   The VLAN [802.1Q] aggregation technique described in this\
    \ document\n   provides a mechanism by which hosts that reside within the same\n\
    \   physical switched infrastructure, but separate virtual broadcast\n   domains,\
    \ may be addressed from the same IPv4 subnet and may share a\n   common default\
    \ gateway IPv4 address.\n   Such a mechanism provides several advantages over\
    \ traditional IPv4\n   addressing architectures employed in large switched LANs\
    \ today.  The\n   primary advantage, that of IPv4 address space conservation,\
    \ can be\n   realized when considering the diagram in Figure 1:\n   Figure 1:\n\

    \      +--------+\n   In the Figure 1 hosts A.1 and A.2 belong to customer A,\
    \ VLAN A.\n   Hosts B.1 and B.2 belong to customer B, VLAN B.  Host C.1 belongs\
    \ to\n   customer C and resides in it's own virtual LAN, VLAN C.\n   Traditionally,\
    \ an IP subnet would be allocated for each customer,\n   based on initial IP requirements\
    \ for address space utilization, as\n   well as on projections of future utilization.\
    \  For example, a scheme\n   such as that illustrated in Table 1 may be used.\n\
    \   Table 1:\n                                Gateway     Usable   Customer\n\
    \     Customer   IP Subnet       Address     Hosts    Hosts\n     ========   ============\
    \    =======     ======   ========\n     A          1.1.1.0/28      1.1.1.1  \
    \   14       13\n     B          1.1.1.16/29     1.1.1.17    6        5\n    \
    \ C          1.1.1.24/30     1.1.1.25    2        1\n   Customer A's initial deployment\
    \ consists of 2 hosts, though they\n   project growth of up to 10 hosts.  As a\
    \ result, they're allocated the\n   IP subnet 1.1.1.0/28 which provides 16 IP\
    \ addresses.  The first IP\n   address, 1.1.1.0, represents the subnetwork number.\
    \  The last IP\n   address, 1.1.1.15, represents the directed broadcast address.\
    \  The\n   first usable address of the subnet, 1.1.1.1, is assigned to the\n \
    \  router and serves as the default gateway IP address for the subnet.\n   The\
    \ customer is left 13 IP addresses, even though their requirement\n   was only\
    \ for 10 IP addresses.\n   Customer B's initial deployment consists of 2 hosts,\
    \ though they\n   project growth of up to 5 hosts.  As a result, they're allocated\
    \ the\n   IP subnet 1.1.1.16/29 which provides 8 IP addresses.  The first IP\n\
    \   address, 1.1.1.16, represents the subnetwork number.  The last IP\n   address,\
    \ 1.1.1.23, represents the directed broadcast address.  The\n   first usable address\
    \ of the subnet, 1.1.1.17, is assigned to the\n   router and serves as the default\
    \ gateway IP address for the subnet.\n   The customer is left 5 with IP addresses.\n\
    \   Customer C's initial deployment consists of 1 host, and they have no\n   plans\
    \ of deploying additional hosts.  As a result, they're allocated\n   the IP subnet\
    \ 1.1.1.24/30 which provides 4 IP addresses.  The first\n   IP address, 1.1.1.24,\
    \ represents the subnetwork number.  The last IP\n   address, 1.1.1.27, represents\
    \ the directed broadcast address.  The\n   first usable address of the subnet,\
    \ 1.1.1.25, is assigned to the\n   router and serves as the default gateway IP\
    \ address for the subnet.\n   The customer is left 1 IP address.\n   The sum of\
    \ address requirements for all three customers is 16.  The\n   most optimal address\
    \ allocation scheme here requires 28 IP addresses.\n   Now, if customer A only\
    \ grows to use 3 of his available address, the\n   additional IP addresses can't\
    \ be used for other customers.\n   Also, assume customer C determines the need\
    \ to deploy one additional\n   host, and as such, requires one additional IP address.\
    \  Because all\n   of the addresses within the existing IP subnet 1.1.1.24/30\
    \ are used,\n   and the following address space has been allocated to other\n\
    \   customers, a new subnet is required.  Ideally, the customer would be\n   allocated\
    \ a /29 and renumber host C.1 into the new subnet.  However,\n   the customer\
    \ is of the opinion that renumbering is not a viable\n   option.  As such, another\
    \ IP subnet is allocated to the customer,\n   this time perhaps a /29, providing\
    \ two additional addresses for\n   future use.\n   As you can see, the number\
    \ of IP addresses consumed by the subnetwork\n   number, directed broadcast address,\
    \ and a unique gateway address for\n   each subnet is quite significant.  Also,\
    \ the inherent constraints of\n   the addressing architecture significantly reduce\
    \ flexibility.\n"
- title: 2. Discussion
  contents:
  - "2. Discussion\n   If within the switched environment, on the routed side of the\n\
    \   network, we introduce the notion of sub-VLANs and super-VLANs, a much\n  \
    \ more optimal approach to IP addressing can be realized.\n   Essentially, what\
    \ occurs is that each sub-VLAN (customer) remains\n   within a separate broadcast\
    \ domain.  One or more sub-VLANs belong to\n   a super-VLAN, and utilize the default\
    \ gateway IP address of the\n   super-VLAN.  Hosts within the sub-VLANs are numbered\
    \ out of IP\n   subnets associated with the super-VLAN, and their IP subnet masking\n\
    \   information reflects that of the super-VLAN subnet.\n   If desired, the super-VLAN\
    \ router performs functions similar to Proxy\n   ARP to enable communication between\
    \ hosts that are members of\n   different sub-VLANs.\n   This model results in\
    \ a much more efficient address allocation\n   architecture.  It also provides\
    \ network operators with a mechanism to\n   provide standard default gateway address\
    \ assignments.\n   Let's again consider Figure 1, now utilizing the super-VLAN\
    \ sub-VLAN\n   model.  Table 2 provides the new addressing model.\n   Table 2:\n\
    \                                Gateway     Usable   Customer\n     Customer\
    \   IP Subnet       Address     Hosts    Hosts\n     ========   ============ \
    \   =======     ======   ========\n     A          1.1.1.0/24      1.1.1.1   \
    \  10       .2-.11\n     B          1.1.1.0/24      1.1.1.1     5        .12-.16\n\
    \     C          1.1.1.0/24      1.1.1.1     1        .17\n   Customer A's initial\
    \ deployment consists of 2 hosts, though they\n   project growth of up to 10 hosts.\
    \  As a result, they're allocated the\n   IP address range 1.1.1.2 - 1.1.1.11.\
    \  The gateway address for the\n   customer is 1.1.1.1, the subnet is 1.1.1.0/24.\n\
    \   Customer B's initial deployment consists of 2 hosts, though they\n   project\
    \ growth of up to 5 hosts.  As a result, they're allocated the\n   IP address\
    \ range 1.1.1.12 - 1.1.1.16.  The gateway address for the\n   customer is 1.1.1.1,\
    \ the subnet is 1.1.1.0/24.\n   Customer C's initial deployment consists of 1\
    \ host, and they have no\n   plans of deploying additional hosts.  As a result,\
    \ they're allocated\n   the IP address 1.1.1.17.  The gateway address for the\
    \ customer is\n   1.1.1.1, the subnet is 1.1.1.0/24.\n   The sum of address requirements\
    \ for all three customers is 16.  As a\n   result, only 16 addresses are allocated\
    \ within the subnet.  These 16\n   addresses, combined with the global default\
    \ gateway address of\n   1.1.1.1, as well as the subnetwork number of 1.1.1.0\
    \ and directed\n   broadcast of 1.1.1.255, result in a total of 19 addresses used.\
    \  This\n   leaves 236 additional usable hosts address with the IP subnet.\n \
    \  Now, if customer A only grows to use 3 of his available addresses,\n   the\
    \ additional IP addresses can be used for other customers.\n   Also, assume customer\
    \ C determines the need to deploy one additional\n   host, and as such, requires\
    \ one additional IP address.  The customer\n   is simply allocated the next available\
    \ IP address within the subnet,\n   their default gateway remains the same.\n\
    \   The benefits of such a model are obvious, especially when employed in\n  \
    \ large LANs or MANs.\n"
- title: 3. Use of Directed Broadcasts
  contents:
  - "3. Use of Directed Broadcasts\n   This specification provides no support for\
    \ directed broadcasts.\n   Specifically, the <net, subnet, -1> directed broadcast\
    \ address can\n   only apply to one of the Layer 2 broadcast domains.\n   Though\
    \ use of directed broadcast is frowned upon in the Internet\n   today, there remain\
    \ a number of applications, primarily in the\n   enterprise arena, that continue\
    \ to use them.  As such, care should be\n   taken to understand the implications\
    \ of using these applications in\n   conjunction with the addressing model outlined\
    \ in this specification.\n"
- title: 4. Multicast Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Multicast Considerations\n   It is assumed that the Layer 2 multicast domain\
    \ will be the same as\n   the Layer 2 broadcast domain (i.e., VLAN).  As such,\
    \ this means that\n   for an IP multicast packet to reach all potential receivers\
    \ in the IP\n   subnet the multicast router(s) attached to the IP subnet need\
    \ to\n   employ something akin to IP host routes for the sender in order for\n\
    \   the Reverse Path Forwarding check to work.\n"
- title: 5. Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Deployment Considerations\n   Extreme Networks has a working implementation\
    \ of this model that has\n   been deployed in service provider data center environments\
    \ for over a\n   year now.  Other vendors are rumored to be developing similar\n\
    \   functionality.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   One obvious issue that does arise with this model\
    \ is the\n   vulnerabilities created by permitting arbitrary allocation of\n \
    \  addresses across disparate broadcast domains.  It is advised that\n   address\
    \ space ranges be made sticky.  That is, when an address or\n   range of addresses\
    \ is allocated to a given sub-VLAN, reception of IP\n   or ARP packets on a sub-VLAN\
    \ with a source IP address that isn't\n   allocated to the sub-VLAN should be\
    \ discarded, and perhaps trigger a\n   logging message or other administrative\
    \ event.\n   Implementation details are intentionally omitted as all functions\
    \ in\n   this document should remain local to the super-VLAN router.  As such,\n\
    \   no interoperability issues with existing protocols should result.\n"
