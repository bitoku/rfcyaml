  - "Background\n   At the IAB meeting on 21 March 88 in videoconference, the report\
    \ of\n   the Ad Hoc Network Management Review Committee was reviewed.  The\n \
    \  recommendations of the committee were endorsed by the IAB and\n   direction\
    \ given to the chairman of the Internet Engineering Task\n   Force to take the\
    \ necessary steps to implement the recommendations.\n   The IAB expressed its\
    \ gratitude for the efforts of the HEMS, SNMP and\n   CMIP/CMIS working groups\
    \ and urged that parties with technical\n   interest in the outcome of the network\
    \ management working groups\n   convey their ideas and issues to the relevant\
    \ working group chairmen.\n   The IETF chairman was directed to form two new working\
    \ groups, one of\n   which would be responsible for the further specification\
    \ and\n   definition of elements to be included in the Management Information\n\
    \   Base (MIB).  The other would be responsible for defining extensions\n   to\
    \ the Simple Network Management Protocol to accommodate the short-\n   term needs\
    \ of the network vendor and operator communities.  The\n   longer-term needs of\
    \ the Internet community are to be met using the\n   ISO CMIS/CMIP framework as\
    \ a basis.  A working group of the IETF\n   exists for this work and would continue\
    \ its work, coordinating with\n   the two new groups and reporting to the IETF\
    \ chairman for guidance.\n   The output of the MIB working group is to be provided\
    \ to both the\n   SNMP working group and the CMIS/CMIP [\"Netman\"] working group\
    \ so as\n   to assure compatibility of monitored items for both network\n   management\
    \ frameworks.\n"
- title: Specific Recommendations
  contents:
  - "Specific Recommendations\n   The IAB recommends that the Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol be\n   adopted as the BASIS for network management in the short-term.\n\
    \   Extensions may be required to the existing SNMP specification to\n   accommodate\
    \ additional data types or to deal with functional or\n   performance issues arising\
    \ as multiple SNMP implementations are\n   deployed and applied, especially in\
    \ multi-vendor applications.\n   The SNMP working group constituted by the IETF\
    \ is charged with\n   considering requirements not met by the present SNMP definition,\n\
    \   defining extensions, if necessary, to accommodate these needs, and\n   preparing\
    \ revisions of the SNMP specifications to address any new\n   extensions.\n  \
    \ The IAB urges the working group to be extremely sensitive to the need\n   to\
    \ keep SNMP simple, to work quickly to come to concensus on any\n   revisions\
    \ needed and to promulgate expeditiously the results of its\n   work in one or\
    \ more RFCs within the next 90 days.  The IETF chairman\n   is responsible for\
    \ resolving disagreements arising if they cannot be\n   resolved within the working\
    \ group and is instructed to escalate\n   problems quickly to the IAB should resolution\
    \ not be forthcoming.\n   The IAB further recommends that the MIB working group\
    \ begin its work\n   equally expeditiously, taking as its starting inputs the\
    \ MIB\n   definitions found in the existing High-Level Entity Management\n   Systems\
    \ (HEMS) RFC-1024, the SNMP IDEA-11, and CMIS/CMIP IDEAs.\n   It is the intention\
    \ of the IAB that the MIB definitions be applied\n   both to the SNMP system in\
    \ the short term and CMIS/CMIP for TCP/IP in\n   the longer term.  The three working\
    \ groups will have to coordinate\n   their efforts carefully to achieve these\
    \ objectives:\n           1. Rapid convergence and definition for SNMP.\n    \
    \       2. Rapid convergence and definition for the TCP/IP MIB.\n           3.\
    \ Provision for transitioning from SNMP to CMIP/CMIS.\n           4. Early demonstration\
    \ of the CMIP/CMIS capability using the\n              TCP/IP MIB.\n   The IAB\
    \ remains extremely interested in progress towards these goals\n   and intends\
    \ to have representation, whenever possible, in the various\n   working group\
    \ and IETF plenary activities.\n         REPORT OF THE AD HOC NETWORK MANAGEMENT\

  - "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n   On 29 February 88, an ad hoc committee was convened to\
    \ review the\n   network management options for the Internet in particular and\
    \ the\n   TCP/IP protocol suite in general.  This meeting was called at the\n\
    \   request of the Internet Activities Board in the course of exercising\n   its\
    \ responsibilities to the Federal Research Internet Coordinating\n   Council (FRICC)\
    \ and by the MITRE Corporation as a consequence of its\n   work for the U.S. Air\
    \ Force on the ULANA project.\n   At the conclusion of the one day meeting, it\
    \ was agreed that the\n   following recommendations be forwarded to the Internet\
    \ Activities\n   Board chairman, Dr. David C. Clark, for consideration at the\
    \ next IAB\n   meeting scheduled for 21 March:\n      1. In the short term, the\
    \ Internet community should adopt and\n      adapt the Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol (SNMP) for use as the\n      basis of common network management throughout\
    \ the system.\n      (Rationale:  The software is available and in operation.)\n\
    \      2. In the longer term, the Internet research community and the\n      vendors\
    \ should develop, deploy and test a network management\n      system based on\
    \ the International Standards Organization (ISO)\n      Common Management Information\
    \ Services/Common Management\n      Information Protocol (CMIS/CMIP).\n      (Rationale:\
    \ The Internet community can take the high ground in\n      protocol development\
    \ by virtue of the experimental environment in\n      which it can operate.  Recommendations\
    \ to the ISO from this\n      community, the IAB and the vendors will carry great\
    \ weight if they\n      are in the language of the ISO common network management\
    \ system\n      and if they are rooted in actual experience with implementation\n\
    \      and use in the field.)\n      3. Responsibility for the SNMP effort should\
    \ be placed in the\n      hands of an IETF task force.\n      (Rationale:  Eliminate\
    \ vendor-specific bias or control over the\n      SNMP and its evolution and harmonize\
    \ inputs from the Internet\n      community.)\n      4. As a high priority effort,\
    \ define an extended Management\n      Information Base (MIB) for SNMP and TCP/IP\
    \ CMIP to bring them into\n      closer conformance with the MIB defined for the\
    \ experimental\n      HighLevel Entity Management System (HEMS).\n      (Rationale:\
    \  The HEMS effort produced a very thorough and widely-\n      discussed set of\
    \ elements to monitor, along with definitions of\n      the semantics of these\
    \ elements.  The current SNMP definitions are\n      more restricted and the CMIP\
    \ definitions less precise.\n      Implementation of SNMP in a timely and useful\
    \ fashion through the\n      Internet cannot be satisfactorily completed without\
    \ such a\n      definition of information elements in hand.)\n      The ad hoc\
    \ committee therefore recommends immediate action by the\n      IAB on all four\
    \ of these points.  It should be noted that this\n      resolution would not have\
    \ been possible in such a timely way\n      without the statesman-like efforts\
    \ of Craig Partridge who, at the\n      end of the day, recommended that the HEMS\
    \ effort be withdrawn from\n      consideration so as to pave the way for an Internet-wide\n\
    \      agreement.  In consideration of this unselfish act, the ad hoc\n      committee\
    \ urges the IAB to approve the recommendations above and\n      to instruct the\
    \ IETF to move quickly to accept and act on the SNMP\n      items requiring completion.\n"
- title: 1. INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "1. INTRODUCTION\n   During its development history, the community of researchers,\n\
    \   developers, implementors and users of the DARPA/DoD TCP/IP protocol\n   suite\
    \ have experimented with a wide range of protocols in a variety\n   of different\
    \ networking environments.  The Internet has grown,\n   especially in the last\
    \ few years, as a result of the widespread\n   availability of software and hardware\
    \ supporting this system.  The\n   scaling of the size and scope of the Internet\
    \ and increased use of\n   its technology in commercial applications has underscored\
    \ for\n   researchers, developers and vendors the need for a common network\n\
    \   management framework within which TCP/IP products can be made to\n   work.\n\
    \   In recognition of this need, several efforts were started to develop\n   network\
    \ management concepts which might be applied to the Internet\n   and to the internet\
    \ technology in general.  Three of these efforts\n   had made sufficient progress\
    \ by the end of 1987 that it became clear\n   that some choices had to be made\
    \ or the community would find itself\n   with a set of incompatible network management\
    \ tools.  These efforts\n   included the High-Level Entity Management System (HEMS),\
    \ the Simple\n   Gateway Monitoring Protocol (SGMP) and the Common Management\n\
    \   Information Service/Protocol.\n   The latter is an ISO initiative which was\
    \ adapted to Internet use in\n   a vendor-initiated effort.  The HEMS work was\
    \ carried out in the\n   context of the Gateway Monitoring group of the Internet\
    \ Engineering\n   Task Force.  The SGMP effort was carried out largely in the\
    \ practical\n   context of the NYSERNET and SURAnet regional networks which needed\n\
    \   network management facilities to operate satisfactorily.\n   Independent of\
    \ the general Internet situation and requirements, the\n   U.S.  Air Force has\
    \ been pursuing a Universal Local Area Network\n   Architecture (ULANA) for its\
    \ own use. The principal agent for the\n   development of the ULANA specifications\
    \ is the MITRE Corporation.\n   Faced with several long and short term network\
    \ management options,\n   the MITRE ULANA specification team initiated an effort\
    \ with\n   substantial vendor participation called the NETMAN working group.\n\
    \   It was against this fabric of various options that the IAB appointed\n   a\
    \ chairman to convene a review committee to discuss these various\n   options\
    \ and to make recommendations on long and short term choices.\n   The MITRE Corporation\
    \ co-sponsored this work to further its aims in\n   the specification of the ULANA\
    \ design.\n   Reference material listed at the end of this report was provided\
    \ in\n   advance of the meeting.\n"

  - "2. DISCUSSION\n   Rather than attempting to produce minutes of the meeting, this\n\
    \   section summarizes in very high level terms the substance of the\n   discussion\
    \ which took place during most of the meeting.  Presentation\n   viewgraphs can\
    \ be made available to IAB/FRICC members interested in\n   their contents.\n \
    \  The agenda was followed fairly closely with the technical\n   presentations\
    \ made in the order suggested: HEMS, SGMP, CMIP/CMIS.\n   The HEMS effort has\
    \ established a benchmark for other network\n   management work in the sense that\
    \ it took a comprehensive conceptual\n   view of the problem and went into considerable\
    \ detail on the design\n   of the underlying management information database,\
    \ the mechanics of\n   access to and reporting of information, considerations\
    \ of scaling and\n   performance (e.g., Query Language vs Remote Procedure Call\
    \ style),\n   definition of information required and so on.  HEMS has been\n \
    \  implemented in an experimental version from which some encouraging\n   performance\
    \ measurements were taken.  Serious vendor interest in this\n   protocol was expressed\
    \ by Cisco Systems and implementation efforts\n   were under way as of the meeting.\n\
    \   The SGMP effort, though somewhat less documented, was rooted in a\n   practical\
    \ need for network management tools for the NYSERNET,\n   SURAnet, and, by extension,\
    \ other components of the Internet.\n   Implementations of it exist, in its RFC-1028\
    \ form (probably with some\n   experimental extensions based on experience gained\
    \ from the initial\n   work), and are in use today.  Serious vendor support for\
    \ this work is\n   found at Proteon and, more recently, in the NSFNET effort by\
    \ MERIT,\n   IBM and MCI, specifically in the IBM Network Switching System (NSS)\n\
    \   nodes.  Applications running above SGMP exist and provide useful\n   monitoring\
    \ information, presented in easily grasped form.\n   The ISO CMIS/CMIP effort,\
    \ voluminously documented, has had almost no\n   implementation as yet.  Reports\
    \ from Unisys/SDC about an experimental\n   implementation were heard at the meeting.\
    \  There is substantial\n   momentum in the international community for the adoption\
    \ of this\n   service and protocol suite for network management.  The Draft\n\
    \   Proposal is out for its second ballot (it failed to make Draft\n   International\
    \ Standard on its first ballot).  There is vocal vendor\n   support for this work,\
    \ based on the premise that ultimately the ISO\n   protocol suite will propagate\
    \ and the vendors must support it.\n   In general, all of the network management\
    \ proposals make use of the\n   Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) which has emerged\
    \ from the ISO\n   efforts as a kind of lingua franca for the representation of\n\
    \   arbitrary data structures.  The data types used in the SGMP\n   Management\
    \ Information Base (aspects of network components to be\n   monitored) are the\
    \ most restricted of the three proposals, confined\n   to integers and octet strings\
    \ only.  HEMS has the most extensive\n   Management Information Base and added\
    \ some rather unique ideas such\n   as self-knowledge about what could be monitored\
    \ so that a\n   device/unit/component could respond to a query asking \"what can\
    \ you\n   tell me about yourself and your operation and how is it represented?\"\
    \n   (!).  CMIS/CMIP is probably the broadest in scope, but less precisely\n \
    \  defined at this point, with respect to information which should be\n   monitored.\
    \  The draft RFCs referenced above relating to the CMIS/CMIP\n   concerning items\
    \ to be monitored are still in the definition stages.\n   A point made strongly\
    \ by the HEMS team was their concern that a\n   Remote Operations basis for CMIP\
    \ may not scale well into a very large\n   Internet which needs to be monitored\
    \ from a few central sites.\n   Remote Operations is a term used by ISO and means,\
    \ roughly, what the\n   Internet community has long referred to as Remote Procedure\
    \ Calls.\n   If each atomic action is a Remote Procedure Call, the HEMS team\n\
    \   argues that increasing Internet size and potential delays may vastly\n   constrain\
    \ the amount and timeliness of information which can be\n   collected.  The HEMS\
    \ design uses, instead, a general query language\n   approach which permits more\
    \ elaborate, multi-variable queries to be\n   formulated at the requesting site\
    \ and processed at the responding\n   site(s).\n   Although it does substantial\
    \ injustice to the very lucid and helpful\n   presentations by representatives\
    \ of each of the network management\n   research groups, I have chosen to leave\
    \ out much of the detail from\n   this report and move directly to the points\
    \ of agreement which were\n   reached by the Committee.\n"

  contents:
  - "3. POINTS OF AGREEMENT\n   (i) Future Internet development is a joint interest\
    \ of the R&D\n   community, the vendor community and the user community.\n   [Editor's\
    \ comment: The development of the Internet is now not only\n   dependent on research\
    \ work, but on the hardware and software of\n   vendors selling to both commercial\
    \ (\"internet\") and the research\n   environment (\"Internet\").  Moreover, the\
    \ Internet users are not all\n   concerned with network research; many of the\
    \ components of the\n   Internet are based on vendor-supplied and supported subsystems.]\n\
    \   (ii) We still don't have a common understanding of what\n   [Inter]Network\
    \ Management really is.\n   [Editor's comment: We haven't tried to manage the\
    \ Internet as a\n   collection of autonomous systems in an effective way, yet.]\n\
    \   (iii) We will learn what [Inter]Network Management is by doing it.\n     \
    \   (a) in as large a scale as is possible\n        (b) with as much diversity\
    \ of implementation as possible\n        (c) over as wide a range of protocol\
    \ layers as possible\n        (d) with as much administrative diversity as we\
    \ can stand.\n   (iv) There are more than HEMS, SGMP and CMIS/CMIP as potential\n\
    \   candidates:\n        HEMS, SGMP, CMIS/CMIP [multiple profiles], NETVIEW,\n\
    \        LANMANAGER, Network Computing Forum \"Fat Document\"...\n   [Editor's\
    \ comment: The multiplicity of options is motivation for\n   coalescing the energy\
    \ of the Internet environment around single short\n   and long term foci so as\
    \ to make more substantial progress in really\n   understanding network management\
    \ per point (iii).]\n   (v) Define the Management Information Base for TCP/IP\
    \ suite NOW!\n   (vi) Seek a seat for IETF on ANSI, ISO and/or CCITT!!!\n   [Editor's\
    \ comment: This may actually be feasible.]\n   (vii) Define a CMIS interface to\
    \ any of the surviving network\n   management schemes so as to provide a migration\
    \ path to ISO.\n"
- title: 4. RESOLUTION AND CONCLUSIONS
  contents:
  - "4. RESOLUTION AND CONCLUSIONS\n   In a dramatic act of statesmanship, Craig Partridge\
    \ volunteered that\n   the HEMS proposal be dropped in favor of the other two\
    \ efforts, SGMP\n   and CMIS/CMIP - IF THIS WOULD LEAD TO INTERNET-WIDE AGREEMENT\
    \ ON A\n   NETWORK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE SHORT AND LONG TERM.\n   A rationale\
    \ for the long term was proposed, based on the assumption\n   that the ISO initiatives,\
    \ and the U.S. Government issuance of the\n   GOSIP guidelines, would ultimately\
    \ require at least the Government\n   users, and hence their vendor suppliers,\
    \ to use ISO-based protocols\n   and tools. In this rationale, the Internet research\
    \ community and its\n   vendors would \"take the high ground\" in network management\
    \ by\n   implementing the CMIS/CMIP on top of the TCP/IP protocol suite and\n\
    \   deploy it widely for experimental use in the Internet.\n   Neither the ISO\
    \ nor any other organization, including the Corporation\n   for Open Systems (COS)\
    \ has anything close to the laboratory in large\n   that the Internet represents.\
    \ By taking the initiative, the Internet\n   working groups can establish credibility\
    \ based on experience which\n   will make it far more feasible to affect the evolution\
    \ of the ISO\n   network management and other related efforts. The Internet community\n\
    \   will be able to speak with authority about problems with the design\n   or\
    \ definition of CMIS/CMIP based on real implementation experience\n   and use,\
    \ rather than solely analytic means.\n   In the short term, however, the Internet\
    \ desperately needs tools to\n   apply to the operational management problems\
    \ associated with its\n   rapid growth. Given the present state of advanced implementation\
    \ of\n   the SGMP and its relative simplicity, the general agreement was that\n\
    \   SGMP (or its re-named successor, SNMP) should be quickly brought to\n   more\
    \ complete specification for widespread implementation and use.\n   In short,\
    \ the ad hoc committee recommends:\n      1. In the short term, the Internet community\
    \ should adopt and\n      adapt the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)\
    \ for use as the\n      basis of common network management throughout the system.\n\
    \      (Rationale: The software is available and in operation.)\n      2. In the\
    \ longer term, the Internet research community and the\n      vendors should develop,\
    \ deploy and test a network management\n      system based on the International\
    \ Standards Organization (ISO)\n      Common Management Information Services/Common\
    \ Management\n      Information Protocol (CMIS/CMIP).\n      (Rationale: The Internet\
    \ community can take the high ground in\n      protocol development by virtue\
    \ of the experimental environment in\n      which it can operate.  Recommendations\
    \ to the ISO from this\n      community, the IAB and the vendors will carry great\
    \ weight if they\n      are in the language of the ISO common network management\
    \ system\n      and if they are rooted in actual experience with implementation\n\
    \      and use in the field.)\n      3. Responsibility for the SNMP effort should\
    \ be placed in the\n      hands of an IETF task force.\n      (Rationale: Eliminate\
    \ vendor-specific bias or control over the\n      SNMP and its evolution and harmonize\
    \ inputs from the Internet\n      community.)\n      4. As a high priority effort,\
    \ define an extended Management\n      Information Base (MIB) for SNMP and TCP/IP\
    \ CMIP to bring them into\n      closer conformance with the MIB defined for the\
    \ experimental\n      HighLevel Entity Management System (HEMS).           (Rationale:\n\
    \      The HEMS effort produced a very thorough and widely-discussed set\n   \
    \   of elements to monitor, along with definitions of the semantics of\n     \
    \ these elements. The current SNMP definitions are more restricted\n      and\
    \ the CMIP definitions less precise. Implementation of SNMP in a\n      timely\
    \ and useful fashion through the Internet cannot be\n      satisfactorily completed\
    \ without such a definition of information\n      elements in hand.)\n"
