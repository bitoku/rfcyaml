Abstract Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346) include cipher suites based on DES (Data Encryption Standard) and IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) algorithms.
DES (when used in single DES mode) and IDEA are no longer recommended for general use in TLS, and have been removed from TLS version 1.2 (RFC 5246).
This document specifies these cipher suites for completeness and discusses reasons why their use is no longer recommended.
Introduction TLS versions 1.0 [TLS10] and 1.1 [TLS11] include cipher suites based on DES (Data Encryption Standard) and IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) algorithms.
DES (when used in single DES mode) and IDEA are no longer recommended for general use in TLS, and have been removed from TLS version 1.2 [TLS12].
This document specifies these cipher suites for completeness and discusses reasons why their use is no longer recommended.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [REQ].
DES Cipher Suites DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a block cipher that was originally approved as a US federal standard in 1976, and is specified in [DES].
For TLS key generation purposes, DES is treated as having a 64 bit key, but it still provides only 56 bits of protection, as 8 of the 64 bits are not used by the algorithm.
DES uses a 64 bit block size.
IDEA Cipher Suite IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) is a block cipher designed by Xuejia Lai and James Massey [IDEA]
IDEA uses a 128 bit key and operates on 64 bit blocks.
The following cipher suite has been defined for using IDEA in CBC mode in TLS: CipherSuite TLS RSA WITH
The key exchange algorithm (RSA) and the MAC algorithm (SHA) are defined in the base TLS specification.
DES Cipher Suites DES has an effective key strength of 56 bits, which has been known to be vulnerable to practical brute force attacks for over 20 years [DH].
A relatively recent 2006 paper by Kumar, et al.
[COPA] describes a system that performs an exhaustive key search in less than nine days on average, and costs less than 10,000 USD to build.
Given this, the single DES cipher suites SHOULD NOT be implemented by TLS libraries.
If a TLS library implements these cipher suites, it SHOULD NOT enable them by default.
Experience has also shown that rarely used code is a source of security and interoperability problems, so existing implementations SHOULD consider removing these cipher suites.
IDEA Cipher Suite IDEA has a 128 bit key, and thus is not vulnerable to an exhaustive key search.
However, the IDEA cipher suite for TLS has not seen widespread use:
most implementations either do not support it, do not enable it by default, or do not negotiate it when other algorithms (such as AES, 3DES, or RC4) are available.
Experience has shown that rarely used code is a source of security and interoperability problems; given this, the IDEA cipher suite SHOULD NOT be implemented by TLS libraries and SHOULD be removed from existing implementations.
IANA Considerations IANA has already allocated values for the cipher suites described in this document in the TLS Cipher Suite Registry, defined in [TLS11].
IANA has updated the references of these cipher suites to point to this document:
TLS RSA WITH IDEA CBC SHA
TLS DHE DSS WITH DES CBC SHA
TLS DHE RSA WITH DES CBC SHA
TLS DH anon WITH DES CBC SHA
This document does not create any new registries to be maintained by IANA, and does not require any new assignments from existing registries.
