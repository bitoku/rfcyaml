- title: 1.  Background and Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Background and Overview\n   UNIX-like operating systems have historically\
    \ made widespread use of\n   \"mbox\" database files for a variety of local email\
    \ purposes.  In the\n   common case, mbox files store linear sequences of one\
    \ or more\n   electronic mail messages, with local email clients treating the\n\
    \   database as a logical folder of email messages.  mbox databases are\n   also\
    \ used by a variety of other messaging tools, such as mailing list\n   management\
    \ programs, archiving and filtering utilities, messaging\n   servers, and other\
    \ related applications.  In recent years, mbox\n   databases have also become\
    \ common on a large number of non-UNIX\n   computing platforms, for similar kinds\
    \ of purposes.\n   The increased pervasiveness of these files has led to an increased\n\
    \   demand for a standardized, network-wide interchange of these files as\n  \
    \ discrete database objects.  In turn, this dictates a need for a\n   general\
    \ media type definition for mbox files, which is the subject\n   and purpose of\
    \ this memo.\n"
- title: 2.  About the mbox Database
  contents:
  - "2.  About the mbox Database\n   The mbox database format is not documented in\
    \ an authoritative\n   specification, but instead exists as a well-known output\
    \ format that\n   is anecdotally documented, or which is only authoritatively\n\
    \   documented for a specific platform or tool.\n   mbox databases typically contain\
    \ a linear sequence of electronic mail\n   messages.  Each message begins with\
    \ a separator line that identifies\n   the message sender, and also identifies\
    \ the date and time at which\n   the message was received by the final recipient\
    \ (either the last-hop\n   system in the transfer path, or the system which serves\
    \ as the\n   recipient's mailstore).  Each message is typically terminated by\
    \ an\n   empty line.  The end of the database is usually recognized by either\n\
    \   the absence of any additional data, or by the presence of an explicit\n  \
    \ end-of-file marker.\n   The structure of the separator lines vary across implementations,\
    \ but\n   usually contain the exact character sequence of \"From\", followed by\
    \ a\n   single Space character (0x20), an email address of some kind, another\n\
    \   Space character, a timestamp sequence of some kind, and an end-of-\n   line\
    \ marker.  However, due to the lack of any authoritative\n   specification, each\
    \ of these attributes are known to vary widely\n   across implementations.  For\
    \ example, the email address can reflect\n   any addressing syntax that has ever\
    \ been used on any messaging system\n   in all of history (specifically including\
    \ address forms that are not\n   compatible with Internet messages, as defined\
    \ by RFC 2822 [RFC2822]).\n   Similarly, the timestamp sequences can also vary\
    \ according to system\n   output, while the end-of-line sequences will often reflect\
    \ platform-\n   specific requirements.  Different data formats can even appear\
    \ within\n   a single database as a result of multiple mbox files being\n   concatenated\
    \ together, or because a single file was accessed by\n   multiple messaging clients,\
    \ each of which has used its own syntax for\n   the separator line.\n   Message\
    \ data within mbox databases often reflects site-specific\n   peculiarities. \
    \ For example, it is entirely possible for the message\n   body or headers in\
    \ an mbox database to contain untagged eight-bit\n   character data that implicitly\
    \ reflects a site-specific default\n   language or locale, or that reflects local\
    \ defaults for timestamps\n   and email addresses; none of this data is widely\
    \ portable beyond the\n   local scope.  Similarly, message data can also contain\
    \ unencoded\n   eight-bit binary data, or can use encoding formats that represent\
    \ a\n   specific platform (e.g., BINHEX or UUENCODE sequences).\n   Many implementations\
    \ are also known to escape message body lines that\n   begin with the character\
    \ sequence of \"From \", so as to prevent\n   confusion with overly-liberal parsers\
    \ that do not search for full\n   separator lines.  In the common case, a leading\
    \ Greater-Than symbol\n   (0x3E) is used for this purpose (with \"From \" becoming\
    \ \">From \").\n   However, other implementations are known not to escape such\
    \ lines\n   unless they are immediately preceded by a blank line or if they also\n\
    \   appear to contain an email address and a timestamp.  Other\n   implementations\
    \ are also known to perform secondary escapes against\n   these lines if they\
    \ are already escaped or quoted, while others\n   ignore these mechanisms altogether.\n\
    \   A comprehensive description of mbox database files on UNIX-like\n   systems\
    \ can be found at http://qmail.org./man/man5/mbox.html, which\n   should be treated\
    \ as mostly authoritative for those variations that\n   are otherwise only documented\
    \ in anecdotal form.  However, readers\n   are advised that many other platforms\
    \ and tools make use of mbox\n   databases, and that there are many more potential\
    \ variations that can\n   be encountered in the wild.\n   In order to mitigate\
    \ errors that may arise from such vagaries, this\n   specification defines a \"\
    format\" parameter to the application/mbox\n   media type declaration, which can\
    \ be used to identify the specific\n   kind of mbox database that is being transferred.\
    \  Furthermore, this\n   specification defines a \"default\" database format which\
    \ MUST be\n   supported by implementations that claim to be compliant with this\n\
    \   specification, and which is to be used as the implicit format for\n   undeclared\
    \ application/mbox data objects.  Additional format types\n   are to be defined\
    \ in subsequent specifications.  Messaging systems\n   that receive an mbox database\
    \ with an unknown format parameter value\n   SHOULD treat the data as an opaque\
    \ binary object, as if the data had\n   been declared as application/octet-stream\n\
    \   Refer to Appendix A for a description of the default mbox format.\n   Note\
    \ that RFC 2046 [RFC2046] defines the multipart/digest media type\n   for transferring\
    \ platform-independent message files.  Because that\n   specification defines\
    \ a set of neutral and strict formatting rules,\n   the multipart/digest media\
    \ type already facilitates highly-\n   predictable transfer and conversion operations;\
    \ as such, implementers\n   are strongly encouraged to support and use that media\
    \ type where\n   possible.\n"

- title: 4.  The application/mbox Media Type Registration
  contents:
  - "4.  The application/mbox Media Type Registration\n   This section provides the\
    \ media type registration application (as per\n   [RFC2048]).\n   MIME media type\
    \ name: application\n   MIME subtype name: mbox\n   Required parameters: none\n\
    \   Optional parameters: The \"format\" parameter identifies the format of\n \
    \  the mbox database and the messages contained therein.  The default\n   value\
    \ for the \"format\" parameter is \"default\", and refers to the\n   formatting\
    \ rules defined in Appendix A of this memo.  mbox databases\n   that do not have\
    \ a \"format\" parameter SHOULD be interpreted as having\n   the implicit \"format\"\
    \ value of \"default\".  mbox databases that have\n   an unknown value for the\
    \ \"format\" parameter SHOULD be treated as\n   opaque data objects, as if the\
    \ media type had been specified as\n   application/octet-stream.  Additional values\
    \ for the format parameter\n   are to be defined in subsequent specifications,\
    \ and registered with\n   IANA.\n   Encoding considerations: If an email client\
    \ receives an mbox database\n   as a message attachment, and then stores that\
    \ attachment within a\n   local mbox database, the contents of the two database\
    \ files may\n   become irreversibly intermingled, such that both databases are\n\
    \   rendered unrecognizable.  In order to avoid these collisions,\n   messaging\
    \ systems that support this specification MUST encode an mbox\n   database (or\
    \ at a minimum, the separator lines) with non-transparent\n   transfer encoding\
    \ (such as BASE64 or Quoted-Printable) whenever an\n   application/mbox object\
    \ is transferred via messaging protocols.\n   Other transfer services are generally\
    \ encouraged to adopt similar\n   encoding strategies in order to allow for any\
    \ subsequent\n   retransmission that might occur, but this is not a requirement.\n\
    \   Implementers should also be prepared to encode mbox data locally if\n   non-compliant\
    \ data is received.\n   Security considerations: mbox data is passive, and does\
    \ not generally\n   represent a unique or new security threat.  However, there\
    \ is risk in\n   sharing any kind of data, because unintentional information may\
    \ be\n   exposed, and this risk certainly applies to mbox data as well.\n   Interoperability\
    \ considerations: Due to the lack of a single\n   authoritative specification\
    \ for mbox databases, there are a large\n   number of variations between database\
    \ formats (refer to the\n   introduction text for common examples), and it is\
    \ expected that non-\n   conformant data will be erroneously tagged or exchanged.\
    \  Although\n   the \"default\" format specified in this memo does not allow for\
    \ these\n   kinds of vagaries, prior negotiation or agreement between humans may\n\
    \   sometimes be needed.\n   Published specification: see Appendix A.\n   Applications\
    \ that use this media type: hundreds of messaging products\n   make use of the\
    \ mbox database format, in one form or another.\n   Magic number(s): mbox database\
    \ files can be recognized by having a\n   leading character sequence of \"From\"\
    , followed by a single Space\n   character (0x20), followed by additional printable\
    \ character data\n   (refer to the description in Appendix A for details).  However,\n\
    \   implementers are cautioned that all such files will not be compliant\n   with\
    \ all of the formatting rules, therefore implementers should treat\n   these files\
    \ with an appropriate amount of circumspection.\n   File extension(s): mbox database\
    \ files sometimes have an \".mbox\"\n   extension, but this is not required nor\
    \ expected.  As with magic\n   numbers, implementers should avoid reflexive assumptions\
    \ about the\n   contents of such files.\n   Macintosh File Type Code(s): None\
    \ are known to be common.\n   Person & email address to contact for further information:\

- title: Appendix A.  The "default" mbox Database Format
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  The \"default\" mbox Database Format\n   In order to improve interoperability\
    \ among messaging systems, this\n   memo defines a \"default\" mbox database format,\
    \ which MUST be\n   supported by all implementations that claim to be compliant\
    \ with this\n   specification.\n   The \"default\" mbox database format uses a\
    \ linear sequence of Internet\n   messages, with each message being immediately\
    \ prefaced by a separator\n   line, and being terminated by an empty line.  More\
    \ specifically:\n      o Each message within the database MUST follow the syntax\
    \ and\n        formatting rules defined in RFC 2822 [RFC2822] and its related\n\
    \        specifications, with the exception that the canonical mbox\n        database\
    \ MUST use a single Line-Feed character (0x0A) as the\n        end-of-line sequence,\
    \ and MUST NOT use a Carriage-Return/Line-\n        Feed pair (NB: this requirement\
    \ only applies to the canonical\n        mbox database as transferred, and does\
    \ not override any other\n        specifications).  This usage represents the\
    \ most common\n        historical representation of the mbox database format,\
    \ and\n        allows for the least amount of conversion.\n      o Messages within\
    \ the default mbox database MUST consist of\n        seven-bit characters within\
    \ an eight-bit stream.  Eight-bit data\n        within the stream MUST be converted\
    \ to a seven-bit form (using\n        appropriate, standardized encoding) and\
    \ appropriately tagged\n        (with the correct header fields) before the database\
    \ is\n        transferred.\n      o Message headers and data in the default mbox\
    \ database MUST be\n        fully-qualified, as per the relevant specification(s).\
    \  For\n        example, email addresses in the various header fields MUST have\n\
    \        legitimate domain names (as per RFC 2822), while extended\n        characters\
    \ and encodings MUST be specified in the appropriate\n        location (as per\
    \ the appropriate MIME specifications), and so\n        forth.\n      o Each message\
    \ in the mbox database MUST be immediately preceded\n        by a single separator\
    \ line, which MUST conform to the following\n        syntax:\n           The exact\
    \ character sequence of \"From\";\n           a single Space character (0x20);\n\
    \           the email address of the message sender (as obtained from the\n  \
    \         message envelope or other authoritative source), conformant\n      \
    \     with the \"addr-spec\" syntax from RFC 2822;\n           a single Space\
    \ character;\n           a timestamp indicating the UTC date and time when the\
    \ message\n           was originally received, conformant with the syntax of the\n\
    \           traditional UNIX 'ctime' output sans timezone (note that the\n   \
    \        use of UTC precludes the need for a timezone indicator);\n          \
    \ an end-of-line marker.\n      o Each message in the database MUST be terminated\
    \ by an empty\n        line, containing a single end-of-line marker.\n   Note\
    \ that the first message in an mbox database will only be prefaced\n   by a separator\
    \ line, while every other message will begin with two\n   end-of-line sequences\
    \ (one at the end of the message itself, and\n   another to mark the end of the\
    \ message within the mbox database file\n   stream) and a separator line (marking\
    \ the new message).  The end of\n   the database is implicitly reached when no\
    \ more message data or\n   separator lines are found.\n   Also note that this\
    \ specification does not prescribe any escape\n   syntax for message body lines\
    \ that begin with the character sequence\n   of \"From \".  Recipient systems\
    \ are expected to parse full separator\n   lines as they are documented above.\n"
