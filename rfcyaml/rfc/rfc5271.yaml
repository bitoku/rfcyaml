  - "Abstract\n   Mobile IPv6 is designed to maintain its connectivity while moving\n\
    \   from one network to another.  It is adopted in 3G CDMA networks as a\n   way\
    \ to maintain connectivity when the mobile node (MN) moves between\n   access\
    \ routers.  However, this handover procedure requires not only\n   movement detection\
    \ by the MN, but also the acquisition of a new\n   Care-of Address and Mobile\
    \ IPv6 registration with the new care-of\n   address before the traffic can be\
    \ sent or received in the target\n   network.  During this period, packets destined\
    \ for the mobile node\n   may be lost, which may not be acceptable for a real-time\
    \ application\n   such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video telephony.  This document\n\
    \   specifies fast handover methods in the 3G CDMA networks in order to\n   reduce\
    \ latency and packet loss during handover.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobile IPv6 [2] allows mobile nodes (MNs) to maintain persistent\
    \ IP\n   connectivity while the MN moves around in the IPv6 network.  It is\n\
    \   adopted in 3G CDMA networks for handling host-based mobility\n   management\
    \ [12].  During handover, however, the mobile node (MN)\n   needs to switch the\
    \ radio link to obtain a new Care-of Address (CoA)\n   and to re-register with\
    \ the home agent (HA), which may cause a\n   communication disruption.  This is\
    \ not desirable for real-time\n   applications such as VoIP and video telephony.\
    \  To reduce this\n   disruption time or latency, a fast handover protocol for\
    \ Mobile IPv6\n   [3] is proposed.  RFC 4260 [7] further describes how this Mobile\
    \ IPv6\n   Fast Handover could be implemented on link layers conforming to the\n\
    \   IEEE 802.11 suite of specifications.  However, 3G CDMA and IEEE\n   802.11\
    \ networks are substantially different in the radio access, the\n   representations\
    \ of the network nodes or parameters, and the network\n   attachment procedures;\
    \ for example, the beacon scanning or New Access\n   Router (NAR) discovery based\
    \ on [Access Point Identifier, Access\n   Router-info (AP-ID, AR-info)] tuples\
    \ specified in RFC 4260 can not be\n   directly applied to 3G CDMA networks. \
    \ This document therefore\n   specifies how Mobile IPv6 fast handovers can be\
    \ applied in the 3G\n   CDMA networks.\n"

- title: 3.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "3.  Terminology\n   This document refers to [3] for Mobile IPv6 fast handover\n\
    \   terminology.  Terms that first appear in this document are defined\n   below:\n\
    \   Access Network Identifier (ANID): An identifier that is used by the\n    \
    \  Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) to determine whether the MN is\n      being\
    \ handed off from the access network that was not previously\n      using this\
    \ PDSN.  Anytime the MN crosses into a new region, which\n      is defined by\
    \ the ANID, it must re-register with that access\n      network.  The ANID is\
    \ further composed of the System ID (SID),\n      Network ID (NID), and Packet\
    \ Zone ID (PZID) and these values are\n      administered by the operator.  The\
    \ lengths of the SID, NID, and\n      PZID are 2 octets, 2 octets, and 1 octet,\
    \ respectively.  Thus,\n      that of the ANID occupies 5 octets [11].\n   Forward\
    \ Pilot Channel:  A portion of the Forward Channel that carries\n      the pilot.\
    \  The Forward Channel is a portion of the physical layer\n      channels transmitted\
    \ from the 3G CDMA access network to the MN.\n      Further, several sets of pilots\
    \ (e.g., the active set or neighbor\n      set) are defined to determine when\
    \ and where to handover.\n   Home Link Prefix (HLP):  The prefix address assigned\
    \ to the home link\n      where the MN should send the binding update message.\
    \  This is also\n      called Home Network Prefix (HNP) and one of the bootstrap\n\
    \      parameters for the MN.\n   International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI):\
    \  The IMSI is a\n      string of decimal digits, up to a maximum of 15 digits,\
    \ that\n      identifies a unique mobile terminal or mobile subscriber\n     \
    \ internationally.  The IMSI consists of three fields:  the Mobile\n      Country\
    \ Code (MCC), the Mobile Network Code (MNC), and the Mobile\n      Subscriber\
    \ Identification Number (MSIN).  An example of the IMSI\n      is \"440701234567890\"\
    , where \"440\" is the MCC, \"70\" is the MNC, and\n      \"1234567890\" is the\
    \ MSIN.  The IMSI conforms to the ITU-T E.212\n      numbering standard [6]. \
    \ In this specification, IMSI is an ASCII\n      string that consists of not more\
    \ than 15 decimal digits (ASCII\n      values between 30 and 39 hexadecimal),\
    \ one character per IMSI\n      digit.  The above example would therefore be encoded\
    \ as \"34 34 30\n      37 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 30\" in hexadecimal notation.\n\
    \   Mobile Identity (MN ID):  An identifier of the Mobile Node that is\n     \
    \ used by the access network.  The value (e.g., IMSI) is unique\n      within\
    \ the operator's network.\n   Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN):  An entity that\
    \ routes MN originated\n      or MN terminated packet data traffic.  A PDSN establishes,\n\
    \      maintains, and terminates link-layer sessions to MNs.  A PDSN is\n    \
    \  the access router in the visited access provider network.\n   Sector Address\
    \ Identifier (SectorID):  A typical cell divides its\n      coverage area into\
    \ several sectors.  In 3G CDMA systems, each\n      sector uses a different PN\
    \ (Pseudo Noise) code offset and is\n      associated with SectorID.  The SectorID\
    \ is 128 bits long and can\n      be represented in the IPv6 address format [8].\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Network Reference Model for Mobile IPv6 over 3G CDMA Networks\n   Figure\
    \ 1 shows a simplified reference model of the Mobile IP enabled\n   3G CDMA networks.\
    \  The home agent (HA) and Authentication,\n   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)\
    \ server of the mobile node (MN)\n   reside in the home IP network, and the MN\
    \ roams within or between the\n   access provider network(s).  Usually, the home\
    \ IP network is not\n   populated by the MNs, which are instead connected only\
    \ to the access\n   provider networks.  Prior to the Mobile IPv6 registration,\
    \ the MN\n   establishes a 3G CDMA access technology specific link-layer\n   connection\
    \ with the access router (AR).  When the MN moves from one\n   AR to another,\
    \ the link-layer connection is re-established, and a\n   Mobile IPv6 handover\
    \ is performed.  Those ARs reside in either the\n   same or different access provider\
    \ network(s).  The figure shows the\n   situation, where the MN moves from the\
    \ Previous Access Router (PAR)\n   to the New Access Router (NAR) via the radio\

    \        Figure 1: Reference Model for Mobile IP\n   In 3G CDMA networks, pilot\
    \ channels transmitted by base stations\n   allow the MN to obtain a rapid and\
    \ accurate C/I (carrier to\n   interference) estimate.  This estimate is based\
    \ on measuring the\n   strength of the Forward Pilot Channel or the pilot, which\
    \ is\n   associated with a sector of a base station (BS).  The MN searches for\n\
    \   the pilots and maintains those with sufficient signal strength in the\n  \
    \ pilot sets.  The MN sends measurement results, which include the\n   offsets\
    \ of the PN code in use and the C/Is in the pilot sets, to\n   provide the radio\
    \ access network (RAN) with the estimate of sectors\n   in its neighborhood. \
    \ There are several triggers for the MN to send\n   those estimates, e.g., when\
    \ the strength of a pilot in the pilot sets\n   exceeds that of the current pilot,\
    \ the MN sends the estimates to the\n   access network.  As long as the sector\
    \ to which the MN is going to\n   move belongs to the same access network, the\
    \ mobility within that\n   access network is handled by the access-specific interfaces\
    \ [10] and\n   the link-layer connection between the MN and AR can be maintained\n\
    \   without a re-establishment.  The MN can continually search for pilots\n  \
    \ without disrupting the data communication and a timely handover is\n   assisted\
    \ by the network.  If, however, the serving access network\n   finds that the\
    \ sector associated with the highest pilot strength\n   belongs to a different\
    \ AR, it attempts to close the connection with\n   the MN.  The MN then attempts\
    \ to get a new traffic channel assigned\n   in the new access network, which is\
    \ followed by establishing a new\n   connection with the new AR.  This could cause\
    \ a noticeable\n   communication disruption and lead to a serious degradation\
    \ of the\n   user experience.  In order to minimize the service degradation,\n\
    \   during the handover between ARs, an IP-level fast handover approach\n   as\
    \ defined in RFC 5268 needs to be involved.  If the air interface\n   information\
    \ can be used as a trigger for the handover between access\n   routers, fast and\
    \ smooth handover of Mobile IPv6 can be realized in\n   3G CDMA networks.  The\
    \ MN can continually search for pilots without\n   disrupting the data communication\
    \ and a timely handover is assisted\n   by the network.\n   To assist the handover\
    \ of the MN to the new AR, various types of\n   information can be considered:\
    \ the pilot sets, which include the\n   candidates of the target sectors or BSs,\
    \ the cell information where\n   the MN resides, the serving nodes in the radio\
    \ access network, and\n   the location of the MN, if available.  To identify the\
    \ access network\n   that the MN moves to or from, the Access Network Identifiers\
    \ (ANID)\n   or the subnet information can be used [9][10].  In this document,\
    \ a\n   collection of such information is called \"handover assist\n   information\"\
    .  In 3G CDMA networks, the Link-Layer Address of the New\n   Access Point (AP)\
    \ defined in [3] may not be available.  If this is\n   the case, the Handover\
    \ Assist Information option defined in this\n   document SHOULD be used instead.\n"
- title: 5.  Fast Handover Procedures
  contents:
  - "5.  Fast Handover Procedures\n   There are two modes defined in [3] according\
    \ to the time of sending\n   the FBU (Fast Binding Update); one is called \"predictive\
    \ mode\", where\n   the MN sends the FBU and receives the FBAck (Fast Binding\n\
    \   Acknowledgment) on the PAR's (Previous Access Router's) link and the\n   other\
    \ is called \"reactive mode\", where the MN sends the FBU from the\n   NAR's (New\
    \ Access Router's) link.  In the predictive mode, the time\n   and place the MN\
    \ hands off must be indicated sufficiently before the\n   time it actually happens.\
    \  In cellular systems, since handovers are\n   controlled by the network, the\
    \ predictive mode is well applied.\n   However, if the network is not configured\
    \ to be able to identify the\n   new AR, to which the MN is moving next, in a\
    \ timely manner, the\n   reactive mode is better applied.\n   Section 2 of RFC\
    \ 4907 [20] suggests architectural principles on the\n   link indication and the\
    \ effectiveness of the optimization.  The link\n   indication of this document\
    \ relies on 3G CDMA networks and the\n   effectiveness of the optimization is\
    \ attributed to RFC 5268.  The\n   above principles are thus considered by the\
    \ related specifications\n   referenced in this document.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Predictive Fast Handover
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Predictive Fast Handover\n   Figure 2 shows the predictive mode of MIPv6\
    \ fast handover operation.\n   When the MN finds a sector or a BS whose pilot\
    \ signal is sufficiently\n   strong, it initiates handover according to the following\
    \ sequence:\n   (a)  A router solicitation for proxy router advertisement is sent\
    \ to\n        the PAR.  Handover assist information for the target 3G CDMA\n \
    \       network is attached to this message.\n   (b)  Based on the received handover\
    \ assist information, the NAR is\n        determined and a proxy router advertisement\
    \ (PrRtAdv) containing\n        the prefix of the NAR is sent back to the MN.\
    \  The MN also\n        checks that the R flag is not set in the PrRtAdv message,\
    \ which\n        indicates the network supports the predictive fast handover mode\n\
    \        (defined later).\n   (c)  The MN creates an NCoA (new CoA) and sends\
    \ the Fast Binding\n        Update (FBU) with the NCoA to the PAR, which in turn\
    \ sends the\n        Handover Initiate (HI) to the NAR.\n   (d)  The NAR sends\
    \ the Handover Acknowledge (HAck) back to the PAR,\n        which in turn sends\
    \ the FBU acknowledgment (FBAck) to the MN.\n   (e)  The PAR starts forwarding\
    \ packets toward the NCoA and the NAR\n        captures and buffers them.\n  \
    \ (f)  The link-layer connection associated with the PAR is closed and\n     \
    \   a new traffic channel is assigned in the new access network.\n   (g)  The\
    \ MN attaches to the new access network.  The attachment\n        procedure is\

    \   It is assumed that the NAR can be identified by the PAR leveraging\n   the\
    \ handover assist information from the MN.  To perform the\n   predictive mode,\
    \ the MN MUST send the FBU before the connection with\n   the current access network\
    \ is closed.  If the MN fails to send the\n   FBU before handover, it SHOULD fall\
    \ back to the reactive mode.  Even\n   if the MN successfully sends the FBU, its\
    \ reception by the PAR may be\n   delayed for various reasons such as congestion.\
    \  If the NAR receives\n   the HI triggered by the delayed FBU after the reception\
    \ of the UNA\n   ((c) comes after (h)), then the NAR SHOULD send the HAck with\n\
    \   handover not accepted and behave as the reactive mode.\n   In (a), Router\

    \   (g)    The link-layer connection establishment and the bootstrapping\n   \
    \       phase.\n   (g-1)  The LCP (Link Control Protocol) configure-request/response\n\
    \          messages are exchanged.\n   (g-2)  User authentication (e.g., Challenge\
    \ Handshake Authentication\n          Protocol (CHAP) or Password Authentication\
    \ Protocol (PAP)) is\n          conducted.\n   (g-3)  The static bootstrapping\
    \ information is conveyed from the AAA\n          and stored in the NAR (target\
    \ PDSN).  The HoA and HLP can be\n          dynamically assigned by the HA in\
    \ the mobility binding phase.\n          This step can be skipped in the handover\
    \ case.\n   (g-4)  Unique interface IDs are negotiated in IPv6 Control Protocol\n\
    \          (IPv6CP).\n   (g-5)  The MN configures its link-local address based\
    \ on the obtained\n          interface ID.\n   (g-6)  A router advertisement containing\
    \ the prefix is received by\n          the MN.\n   (g-7)  The MN configures its\
    \ CoA based on the obtained prefix.\n   (g-8)  DHCPv6 is used to obtain the static\
    \ bootstrap information\n          (e.g., the HA address).  This step is performed\
    \ in the initial\n          attachment and can be skipped once the MN obtains\
    \ those\n          parameters.\n   (g-9)  The MN installs the bootstrap information\
    \ for further\n          procedures (e.g., the mobility binding).\n   As is shown\
    \ in Figure 3, it takes a considerable amount of time to\n   establish a link-layer\
    \ connection and almost all of the above\n   sequences run every time the MN attaches\
    \ to a new access network.  It\n   is therefore beneficial if packets in transit\
    \ to the MN are saved not\n   only during the time period when the MN switches\
    \ to the new radio\n   channel but also during the time period when the MN establishes\
    \ the\n   link-layer connection.\n   There are several ways to configure a unique\
    \ IP address for the MN.\n   If a globally unique prefix is assigned per link\
    \ as introduced in\n   [12], the MN can use any interface ID except that of the\
    \ other peer\n   (the AR to which the MN is attached) to create a unique IP address.\n\
    \   If this is the case, however, the PAR cannot provide the MN with a\n   correct\
    \ prefix for the new network in the PrRtAdv since such a prefix\n   is selected\
    \ by the NAR and provided in the router advertisement.  The\n   MN therefore configures\
    \ a temporary NCoA with the prefix provided by\n   the PAR and the correct NCoA\
    \ MUST be assigned by the NAR.  Therefore,\n   in 3G CDMA network, the PAR MUST\
    \ send the HI with the S flag set when\n   it receives the FBU from the MN at\
    \ step (c) in Figure 2.\n   The UNA is supposed to include the MN-LLA [3], but\
    \ the point-to-point\n   link-layer connection may be able to uniquely identify\
    \ the MN.  The\n   most required information by the UNA is the NCoA to check if\
    \ there is\n   a corresponding buffer.  Therefore, in (h), the function of the\
    \ UNA\n   can be realized in several ways:\n   o  Since the establishment of the\
    \ link-layer connection in (g)\n      indicates readiness of data communication\
    \ on the MN side, the NAR\n      immediately checks if there is a buffer that\
    \ has packets destined\n      for the NCoA, which was configured at steps (c)\
    \ - (d), and starts\n      delivering, if any (substitution of UNA).\n   o  The\
    \ MN sends the UNA as defined in [3].  Instead of the MN-LLA in\n      the LLA\
    \ option, the MN ID MAY be included in the MN ID option\n      (standard implementation\
    \ of UNA).\n   The primary benefit of the predictive fast handover mode is that\
    \ the\n   packets destined for the MN can be buffered at the NAR, and packet\n\
    \   loss due to handover will be much lower than that of the normal MIPv6\n  \
    \ operation.  Regarding the bootstrapping, the following benefit can be\n   obtained,\
    \ too:\n   o  Since the NCoA can be configured via the fast handover procedures,\n\
    \      a router advertisement is not required.\n   Therefore, the procedures (g-4)\
    \ to (g-7) can be skipped from the\n   standard MIPv6 operation in Figure 3.\n"

  - "5.2.  Reactive Fast Handover\n   When the network does not support the predictive\
    \ fast handover mode,\n   the reactive fast handover is applied.  In this document,\
    \ a new flag\n   is defined in PrRtAdv to inform the MN about the capability of\
    \ the\n   network (see Section 6.4).  To minimize packet loss in this\n   situation,\
    \ the PAR instead of the NAR can buffer packets for the MN\n   until the MN regains\
    \ connectivity with the NAR.  The NAR obtains the\n   information of the PAR from\
    \ the MN on the NAR's link and receives\n   packets buffered at the PAR.  In this\
    \ case, the PAR does not need to\n   know the IP address of the NAR or the NCoA\
    \ and just waits for the NAR\n   to contact the PAR.  However, since the PAR needs\
    \ to know when to\n   buffer packets for the MN, the PAR obtains the timing of\
    \ buffering\n   from the MN via the FBU or the lower-layer signaling, e.g., an\n\
    \   indication of the release of the connection with the MN.  Details of\n   the\
    \ procedure are as follows:\n   (a)  A router solicitation for proxy router advertisement\
    \ MAY be sent\n        to the PAR.\n   (b)  The proxy router advertisement MAY\
    \ be sent to the MN.  If the\n        information on the NAR is not available\
    \ by the PAR, \"0::0\" MUST\n        be used for the options related to the NAR\
    \ (e.g., IP address of\n        the NAR).\n   (c)  The MN sends the FBU or the\
    \ access network indicates the close\n        of the connection with the MN by\
    \ the lower-layer signaling.  If\n        the MN cannot formulate the NCoA, \"\
    0::0\", MUST be used for the\n        NCoA in the FBU.  If the B flag is set in\
    \ the FBU, the PAR\n        SHOULD start buffering packets destined for the PCoA.\n\
    \   (d)  The link-layer connection associated with the PAR is closed and\n   \
    \     a new traffic channel is assigned in the new access network.\n   (e)  The\
    \ MN attaches to the new access network.  This part is the\n        same as described\
    \ in Section 5.1 and illustrated in Figure 3.\n   (f)  The MN sends the UNA to\
    \ the NAR.\n   (g)  The MN sends the Fast Binding Update (FBU) to the PAR via\
    \ the\n        NAR.\n   (h)  The NAR forwards the FBU from the MN to the PAR.\n\
    \   (i)  The PAR sends the Handover Initiate (HI) to the NAR with the\n      \
    \  Code set to 1.\n   (j)  The NAR sends the Handover Acknowledge (HAck) back\
    \ to the PAR.\n   (k)  The PAR sends the FBAck to the NAR.\n   (l)  If the PAR\
    \ is buffering packets destined for the PCoA, it starts\n        forwarding them\
    \ as well as newly arriving ones to the NAR.\n   (m)  The NAR delivers the packets\
    \ to the MN.\n   (n)  The MN sends the BU to the HA to update the BCE with the\
    \ NCoA\n        and the HA sends back the BA to the MN.\n        MN          \

    \ can be\n   assumed that the PAR and the NAR have a trust relationship and the\n\
    \   links between them and those between the ARs and the MN are secured.\n   The\
    \ MN is authenticated every time it attaches to the new link;\n   therefore, the\
    \ AR can securely identify the MN.  Depending on the\n   operator's policy, however,\
    \ SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [18] and\n   the shared handover key defined\
    \ in [17] can also be applied.\n"
