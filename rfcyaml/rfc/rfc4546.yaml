          objects defined for\n   DOCSIS 2.0 CMTS implementations:\n   docsIfUpChannelStatus
          - The RowStatus object for the creation of\n   temporary interfaces in the
          upstream interface table.  A temporary\n   entry is used to modify, validate,
          and commit upstream parameters of\n   a physical interface.  In the CMTS,
          a physical upstream interface\n   refers to an upstream logical channel
          interface.\n   docsIfUpChannelCloneFrom - This MIB object associates a physical\n
          \  interface with a temporary interface for the purpose of updating the\n
          \  upstream parameters of the physical interface.\n   docsIfUpChannelUpdate
          - This MIB object is the commit object that\n   transfers the validated
          upstream parameters from the temporary\n   interface to the physical interface.\n
          \  The offline upstream parameters handling operation is as follows:\n   o
          \ A temporary interface is created in which docsIfUpChannelStatus is\n      set
          to 'createAndWait', which turns the new create entry status to\n      'notReady'.\n
          \  o  A SET to docsIfUpChannelCloneFrom in the temporary interface to\n
          \     the physical interface ifIndex value performs two actions:\n      *
          \ Creates the association of the physical interface to the\n         temporary
          interface.\n      *  Copies the original upstream parameters from the physical\n
          \        interface to the temporary interface, which turns its status to\n
          \        'notInService'.\n   o  The operator modifies the temporary interface
          parameters to the\n      desired values.\n   o  At this point, a SET to
          'active' to the RowStatus of the temporary\n      interface is successful
          if all parameters in the temporary\n      interface are valid for the associated
          physical interface;\n      otherwise, the temporary entry remains with status
          'notInservice',\n      and the SET returns the error 'commitFailed'.\n   o
          \ When the temporary interface status is 'active', a SET to\n      docsIfUpChannelUpdate
          to 'true' transfers the temporary interface\n      parameters values to
          the physical interface.\n   o  After completion of the update operations,
          the temporary interface\n      is destroyed, setting the docsIfUpChannelStatus
          to 'destroy'.\n"

          offline handling of the configuration of\n   physical interfaces; it does
          not manage the creation or control of\n   physical interfaces.  To maintain
          a consistent operation and status\n   report of interfaces, this object
          does not manage the administrative\n   and operational status of physical
          interfaces.\n"

    entry through an SNMP SET\n                using 'createAndWait'.  At this point,
    the RowStatus\n                reports 'notReady'.\n                The Manager

    the physical interfaces for the\n                creation of a temporary interface.\n
    \            2. Set the docsIfUpChannelCloneFrom object to the ifIndex\n                value
    of the physical row to update.  Now\n                docsIfUpChannelStatus reports
    'notInService'.\n             3. Change the upstream parameters to the desired
    values\n                in the temporary row.\n             4. Validate that all
    parameters are consistent by setting\n                docsIfUpChannelStatus to
    'active'.  A failure to set the\n                RowStatus to 'active' returns
    the error 'commitFailed',\n                which means the parameters are not
    compatible with the\n                target physical interface.\n             5.
    With docsIfUpChannelStatus 'active', transfer the\n                parameters
    to the target physical interface by setting\n                the object docsIfUpChannelUpdate
    to 'true'.\n             6. Delete the temporary row by setting\n                docsIfUpChannelStatus

    \            Upstream Channel Utilization Index:\n             The upstream channel

    \            considered utilized if the CMTS received an upstream\n             burst
    within the region from any CM on the physical\n             channel.  For contention
    REQ and REQ/DATA regions, the\n             mini-slots for a transmission opportunity
    within the\n             region are considered utilized if the CMTS received an\n
    \            upstream burst within the opportunity from any CM on the\n             physical

    which the CMTS granted\n             bandwidth to any unicast SID on the physical
    channel.\n             For an upstream interface that has multiple logical\n             upstream

    index is the\n             percentage of upstream mini-slots allocated for the\n

    Index:\n             The downstream channel utilization index is a percentage\n

      \  DOCSIS 2.0 devices and their system capabilities.  The MIB module is\n   an
      update to RFC 2670 [RFC2670] with the additional incorporation of\n   DOCSIS
      2.0 [RFI2.0] and Euro-DOCSIS specification requirements\n   [EN-300-429].\n"

    - "5.2.  Extension\n   We have maintained the MIB objects as defined in RFC 2670
      [RFC2670].\n   In some cases new MIB objects have been created with identical\n
      \  functionality but greater capacity (i.e., 32 to 64 bits).  In these\n   situations,
      both the original 32 bit objects and the new 64 bit\n   objects must be implemented.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB module relates to a system that will
    provide metropolitan\n   public internet access.  As such, improper manipulation
    of the MIB\n   objects represented by this MIB module may result in denial of\n
    \  service to a large number of end-users.\n   There are a number of management
    objects defined in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or
    read-create.  Such objects\n   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
    network\n   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\n
    \  The CMTS is the controller of most of the parameters of the DOCSIS\n   RFI
    Interface.  Therefore, write access to the CMTS MIB objects may\n   compromise
    the end-user's services.\n   In the CM case, the only read-write object of this
    MIB module is\n   docsIfCmRangingTimeout, which if SET maliciously, may not constitute\n
    \  a critical factor of service degradation.\n   The rest of the CM-required MIB
    objects in this MIB module are read-\n   only, either by definition, or by compliance
    statements.\n   The CMTS is the controller of most of the parameters of the DOCSIS\n
    \  RFI Interface.  Below are the CMTS MIB object's vulnerabilities:\n   o  Objects
    in the docsIfBasicGroupv2, if SET maliciously, could\n      result in a denial
    of service.  Particularly, SETs to objects in\n      docsIfDownstreamChannelTable,
    docsIfUpstreamChannelTable,\n      docsIfCmtsModulationTable, and docsIfQosProfileTable
    (the last one\n      in conjunction with the MIB object\n      docsIfCmtsQosProfilePermissions)
    can alter negatively the physical\n      and link layer parameters of upstream
    and downstream channels.\n   o  The Object docsIfCmtsServiceAdminStatus of the
    docsIfCmtsGroupv2\n      group, when SET maliciously by an attacker to 'disabled'
    or\n      'destroyed', will interrupt the service of the corresponding cable\n
    \     modem.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects
    with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n
    \  vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control
    even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt
    the values of these objects when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.  Below
    are some sensitivity considerations:\n   o  Read access to the MIB objects in
    tables docsIfCmStatusTable (CM),\n      docsIfSignalQualityTable (CM/CMTS) and
    in CMTS tables\n      docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable, docsIfCmtsChannelUtilizationTable,\n
    \     docsIfCmtsDownChannelCounterTable, and\n      docsIfCmtsUpChannelCounterTable,
    could reveal information about\n      the cable modems' distribution among the
    upstream and downstream\n      channels and their performance, which could be
    used to gain access\n      to a different tiered service offer.  The table\n      docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable
    also contains the MAC and IP addresses of\n      the cable modems, which can be
    used for theft of service.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate
    security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n
    \  even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed
    to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB
    module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
    as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including
    full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and
    privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.
    \ Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic
    security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to ensure that the
    SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module is properly configured
    to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n
    \  rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
