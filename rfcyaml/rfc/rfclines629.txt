Network users may send mail to individuals and to groups, input as messages or entire files, through the Network Journal, using SNDMSG or their site's mail system.
The mail is converted at NIC into NLS files, Journalized, and sent to specified recipients.
Short messages may be received as messages, longer ones as citations to files which may be retrieved immediately, and also later, by using FTP.
SENDING THE MESSAGE OR FILE BY TELEX SNDMSG Construct user field with slash and NIC idents:
To send to a group, use group ident, e.g. "JEW/NLG@NIC".
To combine Journal SNDMSG with SNDMSG to others, add others' Network addresses after commas, e.g. "JEW/DHC@NIC,PRATT@ISI".
See ARPANET Directory for NIC idents and Network addresses.
Title of Message <CR> [Message (? for help):]
^B allows insertion of a sequential file as the message or at any point in the test of the message: ^B
When using SNDMSG through TELNET, change TELNET escape character, to ^Q for example, allowing ^Z to be used for end of message.

> Using Other Mail Systems: It is not possible to give a generalized scenario for use with all local mail systems.
The general procedure, to be applied to the local mail system, is to supply: "NIC" as the host name, and Sender's NIC ident / Addressee's NIC ident as user name See RFC543, NIC 17777, for more detail on Network Journal.
