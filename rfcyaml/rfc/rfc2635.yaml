  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet's origins in the Research and Education communities\n\
    \   played an important role in the foundation and formation of Internet\n   culture.\
    \  This culture defined rules for network etiquette\n   (netiquette) and communication\
    \ based on the Internet's being\n   relatively off-limits to commercial enterprise.\n\
    \   This all changed when U.S. Government was no longer the primary\n   funding\
    \ body for the U.S. Internet, when the Internet truly went\n   global, and when\
    \ all commercial enterprises were allowed to join what\n   had been strictly research\
    \ networks.  Internet culture had become\n   deeply embedded in the protocols\
    \ the network used.  Although the\n   social context has changed, the technical\
    \ limits of the Internet\n   protocols still require a person to enforce certain\
    \ limits on\n   resource usage for the 'Net to function effectively.  Strong\n\
    \   authentication was not built into the News and Mail protocols.  The\n   only\
    \ thing that is saving the Internet from congestion collapse is\n   the voluntary\
    \ inclusion of TCP backoff in almost all of the TCP/IP\n   driver code on the\
    \ Internet.  There is no end-to-end cost accounting\n   and/or cost recovery.\
    \  Bandwidth is shared among all traffic without\n   resource reservation (although\
    \ this is changing).\n   Unfortunately for all of us, the culture so carefully\
    \ nurtured\n   through the early years of the Internet was not fully transferred\
    \ to\n   all those new entities hooking into the bandwidth.  Many of those\n \
    \  entities believe they have found a paradise of thousands of potential\n   customers\
    \ each of whom is desperate to learn about stunning new\n   business opportunities.\
    \  Alternatively, some of the new netizens\n   believe all people should at least\
    \ hear about the one true religion\n   or political party or process.  And some\
    \ of them know that almost no\n   one wants to hear their message but just can't\
    \ resist how inexpensive\n   the net can be to use.  While there may be thousands\
    \ of folks\n   desperate for any potential message, mass mailings or Netnews\n\
    \   postings are not at all appropriate on the 'Net.\n   This document explains\
    \ why mass unsolicited email and Netnews posting\n   (aka spam) is bad, what to\
    \ do if you get it, what webmasters,\n   postmasters, and news admins can do about\
    \ it, and how an Internet\n   Service Provider might respond to it.\n"
- title: 2.  What is Spam*?
  contents:
  - "2.  What is Spam*?\n   The term \"spam\" as it is used to denote mass unsolicited\
    \ mailings or\n   netnews postings is derived from a Monty Python sketch set in\
    \ a\n   movie/tv studio cafeteria.  During that sketch, the word \"spam\" takes\n\
    \   over each item offered on the menu until the entire dialogue consists\n  \
    \ of nothing but \"spam spam spam spam spam spam and spam.\"  This so\n   closely\
    \ resembles what happens when mass unsolicited mail and posts\n   take over mailing\
    \ lists and netnews groups that the term has been\n   pushed into common usage\
    \ in the Internet community.\n   When unsolicited mail is sent to a mailing list\
    \ and/or news group it\n   frequently generates more hate mail to the list or\
    \ group or apparent\n   sender by people who do not realize the true source of\
    \ the message.\n   If the mailing contains suggestions for removing your name\
    \ from a\n   mailing list, 10s to 100s of people will respond to the list with\n\
    \   \"remove\" messages meant for the originator.  So, the original message\n\
    \   (spam) creates more unwanted mail (spam spam spam spam), which\n   generates\
    \ more unwanted mail (spam spam spam spam spam spam and\n   spam).  Similar occurrences\
    \ are perpetrated in newsgroups, but this\n   is held somewhat in check by \"\
    cancelbots\" (programs which cancel\n   postings) triggered by mass posting. \
    \ Recently, cancelbots have grown\n   less in favor with those administering News\
    \ servers since the\n   cancelbots are now generating the same amount of traffic\
    \ as spam.\n   Even News admins are beginning to use filters, demonstrating that\n\
    \   spam spam spam spam spam spam and spam is a monumental problem.\n"
- title: 3.  Why Mass Mailing is Bad
  contents:
  - "3.  Why Mass Mailing is Bad\n   In the world of paper mail we're all used to\
    \ receiving unsolicited\n   circulars, advertisements, and catalogs.  Generally\
    \ we don't object\n   to this - we look at what we find of interest, and we discard/recycle\n\
    \   the rest.  Why should receiving unsolicited email be any different?\n   The\
    \ answer is that the cost model is different.  In the paper world,\n   the cost\
    \ of mailing is borne by the sender.  The sender must pay for\n   the privilege\
    \ of creating the ad and the cost of mailing it to the\n   recipient.  An average\
    \ paper commercial mailing in the U.S.  ends up\n   costing about $1.00 per addressee.\
    \  In the world of electronic\n   communications, the recipient bears the majority\
    \ of the cost.  Yes,\n   the sender still has to compose the message and the sender\
    \ has to pay\n   for Internet connectivity.  However, the recipient ALSO has to\
    \ pay\n   for Internet connectivity and possibly also connect time charges and\n\
    \   for disk space. For electronic mailings the recipient is expected to\n   help\
    \ share the cost of the mailing.  Bulk Internet mail from the U.S.\n   ends up\
    \ costing the sender only about 1/100th of a cent per address;\n   or FOUR ORDERS\
    \ of magnitude LESS than bulk paper mailings!\n   Of course, this cost model is\
    \ very popular with those looking for\n   cheap methods to get their message out.\
    \  By the same token, it's very\n   unpopular with people who have to pay for\
    \ their messages just to find\n   that their mailbox is full of junk mail.  Neither\
    \ do they appreciate\n   being forced to spend time learning how to filter out\
    \ unwanted\n   messages.  Consider this: if you had to pay for receiving paper\
    \ mail\n   would you pay for junk mail?\n   Another consideration is that the\
    \ increase in volume of spam will\n   have an impact on the viability of electronic\
    \ mail as a\n   communications medium.  If, when you went to your postal mail\
    \ box you\n   found four crates of mail, would you be willing to search through\
    \ the\n   crates for the one or two pieces of mail which were not advertising?\n\
    \   Spam has a tremendous potential to create this scenario in the\n   electronic\
    \ world.\n   Frequently spammers indulge in unethical behavior such as using mail\n\
    \   servers which allow mail to be relayed to send huge amounts of\n   electronic\
    \ solicitations.  Or they forge their headers to make it\n   look as if the mail\
    \ originates from a different domain.  These people\n   don't care that they're\
    \ intruding into a personal or business mailbox\n   nor do they care that they\
    \ are using other people's resources without\n   compensating them.\n   The huge\
    \ cost difference has other bad effects.  Since even a very\n   cheap paper mailing\
    \ is going to cost tens of (U.S.) cents there is a\n   real incentive to send\
    \ only to those really likely to be interested.\n   So paper bulk mailers frequently\
    \ pay a premium to get high quality\n   mailing lists, carefully prune out bad\
    \ addresses and pay for services\n   to update old addresses.  Bulk email is so\
    \ cheap that hardly anyone\n   sending it bothers to do any of this.  As a result,\
    \ the chance that\n   the receiver is actually interested in the mail is very,\
    \ very, very\n   low.\n   As of the date of this document, it is a daily event\
    \ on the Internet\n   for a mail service to melt-down due to an overload of spam.\
    \  Every\n   few months this happens to a large/major/regional/\n   national/international\
    \ service provider resulting in denial of or\n   severe degradation of service\
    \ to hundreds of thousands of users.\n   Such service degradations usually prompt\
    \ the providers to spend\n   hundreds of thousands of dollars upgrading their\
    \ mail service\n   equipment just because of the volume of spam.  Service providers\
    \ pass\n   those costs on to customers.\n   Doesn't the U.S. Constitution guarantee\
    \ the ability to say whatever\n   one likes?  First, the U.S. Constitution is\
    \ law only in the U.S., and\n   the Internet is global.  There are places your\
    \ mail will reach where\n   free speech is not a given.  Second, the U.S. Constitution\
    \ does NOT\n   guarantee one the right to say whatever one likes.  In general,\
    \ the\n   U.S. Constitution refers to political freedom of speech and not to\n\
    \   commercial freedom of speech. Finally, and most importantly, the U.S.\n  \
    \ Constitution DOES NOT guarantee the right to seize the private\n   property\
    \ of others in order to broadcast your speech.  The Internet\n   consists of a\
    \ vast number of privately owned networks in voluntary\n   cooperation.  There\
    \ are laws which govern other areas of electronic\n   communication, namely the\
    \ \"junk fax\" laws.  Although these have yet\n   to be applied to electronic\
    \ mail they are still an example of the\n   \"curbing\" of \"free speech.\"  Free\
    \ speech does not, in general,\n   require other people to spend their money and\
    \ resources to deliver or\n   accept your message.\n   Most responsible Internet\
    \ citizens have come to regard unsolicited\n   mail/posts as \"theft of service\"\
    .  Since the recipient must pay for\n   the service and for the most part the\
    \ mail/posts are advertisements\n   of unsolicited \"stuff\" (products, services,\
    \ information) those\n   receiving it believe that the practice of making the\
    \ recipient pay\n   constitutes theft.\n   The crux of sending large amounts of\
    \ unsolicited mail and news is not\n   a legal issue so much as an ethical one.\
    \  If you are tempted to send\n   unsolicited \"information\" ask yourself these\
    \ questions: \"Whose\n   resources is this using?\"  \"Did they consent in advance?\"\
    \  \"What\n   would happen if everybody (or a very large number of people) did\n\
    \   this?\" \"How would you feel if 90% of the mail you received was\n   advertisements\
    \ for stuff you didn't want?\" \"How would you feel if 95%\n   of the mail you\
    \ received was advertisements for stuff you didn't\n   want?\"  \"How would you\
    \ feel if 99% of the mail you received was\n   advertisements for stuff you didn't\
    \ want?\"\n   Although numbers on the volume and rate of increase of spam are\
    \ not\n   easy to find, seat-of-the-pants estimates from the people on spam\n\
    \   discussion mailing lists [1] indicate that unsolicited mail/posts\n   seems\
    \ to be following the same path of exponential growth as the\n   Internet as a\
    \ whole [2].  This is NOT encouraging, as this kind of\n   increase puts a strain\
    \ on servers, connections, routers, and the\n   bandwidth of the Internet as a\
    \ whole.  On a per person basis,\n   unsolicited mail is also on the increase,\
    \ and individuals also have\n   to bear the increasing cost of increasing numbers\
    \ of unsolicited and\n   unwanted mail.  People interested in hard numbers may\
    \ want to point\n   their web browsers to\n   http://www.techweb.com/se/directlink.cgi?INW19980504S0003\
    \ where\n   Internet Week reports what spam costs.\n   Finally, sending large\
    \ volumes of unsolicited email or posting\n   voluminous numbers of Netnews postings\
    \ is just plain rude.  Consider\n   the following analogy: Suppose you discovered\
    \ a large party going on\n   in a house on your block.  Uninvited, you appear,\
    \ then join each\n   group in conversation, force your way in, SHOUT YOUR OPINION\
    \ (with a\n   megaphone) of whatever you happen to be thinking about at the time,\n\
    \   drown out all other conversation, then scream \"discrimination\" when\n  \
    \ folks tell you you're being rude.\n   To continue the party analogy, suppose\
    \ instead of forcing your way\n   into each group you stood on the outskirts a\
    \ while and listened to\n   the conversation.  Then you gradually began to add\
    \ comments relevant\n   to the discussion.  Then you began to tell people your\
    \ opinion of the\n   issues they were discussing; they would probably be less\
    \ inclined to\n   look badly on your intrusion.  Note that you are still intruding.\n\
    \   And that it would still be considered rude to offer to sell products\n   or\
    \ services to the guests even if the products and services were\n   relevant to\
    \ the discussion.  You are in the wrong venue and you need\n   to find the right\
    \ one.\n   Lots of spammers act as if their behavior can be forgiven by\n   beginning\
    \ their messages with an apology, or by personalizing their\n   messages with\
    \ the recipient's real name, or by using a number of\n   ingratiating techniques.\
    \  But much like the techniques used by Uriah\n   Heep in Dickens' _David Copperfield_,\
    \ these usually have an effect\n   opposite to the one intended.  Poor excuses\
    \ (\"It's not illegal,\"\n   \"This will be the only message you receive,\" \"\
    This is an ad,\" \"It's\n   easy to REMOVE yourself from our list\") are still\
    \ excuses.  Moreover,\n   they are likely to make the recipient MORE aggravated\
    \ rather than\n   less aggravated.\n   In particular, there are two very severe\
    \ problems with believing that\n   a \"remove\" feature to stop future mail helps:\
    \ (1) Careful tests have\n   been done with sending remove requests for \"virgin\"\
    \ email accounts\n   (that have never been used anywhere else).  In over 80% of\
    \ the cases,\n   this resulted in a deluge of unsolicited email, although usually\
    \ from\n   other sources than the one the remove was sent to.  In other words,\n\
    \   if you don't like unsolicited mail, you should think carefully before\n  \
    \ using a remove feature because the evidence is that it will result in\n   more\
    \ mail not less.  (2) Even if it did work, it would not stop lots\n   of new unsolicited\
    \ email every day from new businesses that hadn't\n   mailed before.\n"
- title: 4a. ACK!  I've Been Spammed - Now What?
  contents:
  - "4a. ACK!  I've Been Spammed - Now What?\n   It's unpleasant to receive mail which\
    \ you do not want.  It's even\n   more unpleasant if you're paying for connect\
    \ time to download it.\n   And it's really unpleasant to receive mail on topics\
    \ which you find\n   offensive.  Now that you're good and mad, what's an appropriate\n\
    \   response?\n   First, you always have the option to delete it and get on with\
    \ your\n   life.  This is the easiest and safest response.  It does not\n   guarantee\
    \ you won't get more of the same in the future, but it does\n   take care of the\
    \ current problem.  Also, if you do not read your mail\n   on a regular basis\
    \ it is possible that your complaint is much too\n   late to do any good.\n  \
    \ Second, consider strategies that take advantage of screening\n   technology.\
    \  You might investigate technologies that allow you to\n   filter unwanted mail\
    \ before you see it.  Some software allows you to\n   scan subject lines and delete\
    \ unwanted messages before you download\n   them.  Other programs can be configured\
    \ to download portions of\n   messages, check them to see if they are advertising\
    \ (for example) and\n   delete them before the whole message is downloaded.\n\
    \   Also, your organization or your local Internet Service Provider may\n   have\
    \ the ability to block unwanted mail at their mail relay machines\n   and thus\
    \ spare you the hassle of dealing with it at all.  It is worth\n   inquiring about\
    \ this possibility if you are the victim of frequent\n   spam.\n   Your personal\
    \ mailer software may allow you to write rules defining\n   what you do and do\
    \ not wish to read.  If so, write a rule which sends\n   mail from the originator\
    \ of the unwanted mail to the trash.  This\n   will work if one sender or site\
    \ repeatedly bothers you.  You may also\n   consider writing other rules based\
    \ on other headers if you are sure\n   the probability of them being activated\
    \ for non-spam is low enough.\n   That way, although you may still have to pay\
    \ to download it, you\n   won't have to read it!\n   Third, you may consider sending\
    \ the mail back to the originator\n   objecting to your being on the mailing-list;\
    \ however, we recommend\n   against this.  First, a lot of spammers disguise who\
    \ they are and\n   where their mail comes from by forging the mail headers.  Unless\
    \ you\n   are very experienced at reading headers discovering the true origin\n\
    \   of the mail will probably prove difficult.  Although you can engage\n   your\
    \ local support staff to help you with this, they may have much\n   higher priorities\
    \ (such as setting up site-wide filters to prevent\n   spam from entering the\
    \ site).  Second, responding to this email will\n   simply verify your address\
    \ as valid and make your address more\n   valuable for other (ab)uses (as was\
    \ mentioned above in Section 3).\n   Third, even if the two previous things do\
    \ not happen, very probably\n   your mail will be directed to the computer equivalent\
    \ of a black hole\n   (the bit-bucket).\n   As of the writing of this document,\
    \ there are several pieces of\n   pending legislation in several jurisdictions\
    \ about the sending of\n   unsolicited mail and also about forging headers.  If\
    \ forging of\n   headers should become illegal, then responding to the sender\
    \ is less\n   risky and may be useful.\n   Certainly we advocate communicating\
    \ to the originator (as best as you\n   can tell) to let them know you will NOT\
    \ be buying any products from\n   them as you object to the method they have chosen\
    \ to conduct their\n   business (aka spam).  Most responses through media other\
    \ than\n   electronic mail (mostly by those who take the time to phone included\n\
    \   \"800\" (free to calling party in the U.S.) phone numbers) have proved\n \
    \  somewhat effective.  You can also call the business the advertisement\n   is\
    \ for, ask to speak to someone in authority, and then tell them you\n   will never\
    \ buy their products or use their services because their\n   advertising mechanism\
    \ is spam.\n   Next, you can carbon copy or forward the questionable mail messages\n\
    \   or news postings to your postmaster.  You can do this by sending mail\n  \
    \ \"To: Postmaster@your-site.example.\"  Your postmaster should be an\n   expert\
    \ at reading mail headers and will be able to tell if the\n   originating address\
    \ is forged.  He or she may be able to pinpoint the\n   real culprit and help\
    \ close down the site.  If your postmaster wants\n   to know about unsolicited\
    \ mail, be sure s/he gets a copy, including\n   headers.  You will need to find\
    \ out the local policy and comply.\n                             *** IMPORTANT\
    \ ***\n   Wherever you send a complaint, be sure to include the full headers\n\
    \   (most mail and news programs don't display the full headers by\n   default).\
    \  For mail it is especially important to show the\n   \"Received:\" headers.\
    \  For Usenet news, it is the \"Path:\" header.\n   These normally show the route\
    \ by which the mail or news was\n   delivered.  Without them, it's impossible\
    \ to even begin to tell where\n   the message originated.  See the appendix for\
    \ an example of a mail\n   header.\n   There is lively and ongoing debate about\
    \ the validity of changing\n   one's email address in a Web Browser in order to\
    \ have Netnews posts\n   and email look as if it is originating from some spot\
    \ other than\n   where it does originate.  The reasoning behind this is that web\
    \ email\n   address harvesters will not be getting a real address when it\n  \
    \ encounters these.  There is reason on both sides of this debate: If\n   you\
    \ change your address, you will not be as visible to the\n   harvesters, but if\
    \ you change your address, real people who need to\n   contact you will be cut\
    \ off as well.  Also, if you are using the\n   Internet through an organization\
    \ such as a company, the company may\n   have policies about \"forging\" addresses\
    \ - even your own!  Most people\n   agree that the consequences of changing your\
    \ email address on your\n   browser or even in your mail headers is fairly dangerous\
    \ and will\n   nearly guarantee your mail goes into a black hole unless you are\
    \ very\n   sure you know what you are doing.\n   Finally, DO NOT respond by sending\
    \ back large volumes of unsolicited\n   mail.  Two wrongs do not make a right;\
    \ do not become your enemy; and\n   take it easy on the network.  While the legal\
    \ status of spam is\n   uncertain, the legal status (at least in the U.S.) of\
    \ a \"mail bomb\"\n   (large numbers and/or sizes of messages to the site with\
    \ the intent\n   of disabling or injuring the site) is pretty clear: it is criminal.\n\
    \   There is a web site called \"www.abuse.net\" which allows you to\n   register,\
    \ then send your message to the name of the \"offending-\n   domain@abuse.net,\"\
    \ which will re-mail your message to the best\n   reporting address for the offending\
    \ domain.  The site contains good\n   tips for reporting abuse netnews or email\
    \ messages.  It also has some\n   automated tools that you may download to help\
    \ you filter your\n   messages.  Also check CIAC bulletin I-005 at:\n      http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/bulletins/i-005c.shtml\n\
    \   or at:\n      http://spam.abuse.net/spam/tools/mailblock.html.\n   Check the\

  - "4b. There's a Spam in My Group!\n   Netnews is also subject to spamming.  Here\
    \ several factors help to\n   mitigate against the propagation of spam in news,\
    \ although they don't\n   entirely solve the problem.  Newsgroups and mailing\
    \ lists may be\n   moderated, which means that a moderator approves all mail/posts.\
    \  If\n   this is the case, the moderator usually acts as a filter to remove\n\
    \   unwanted and off-topic posts/mail.\n   In Netnews there are programs which\
    \ detect posts which have been sent\n   to multiple groups or which detect multiple\
    \ posts from the same\n   source to one group.  These programs cancel the posts.\
    \  While these\n   work and keep unsolicited posts down, they are not 100% effective\
    \ and\n   spam in newsgroups seems to be growing at an even faster rate than\n\
    \   spam in mail or on mailing lists.  After all, it's much easier to\n   post\
    \ to a newsgroup for which there are thousands of readers than it\n   is to find\
    \ individual email addresses for all those folks.  Hence the\n   development of\
    \ the \"cancelbots\" (sometimes called \"cancelmoose\") for\n   Netnews groups.\
    \  Cancelbots are triggered when one message is sent to\n   a large number of\
    \ newsgroups or when many small messages are sent\n   (from one sender) to the\
    \ same newsgroup.  In general these are tuned\n   to the \"Breidbart Index\" [3]\
    \ which is a somewhat fuzzy measure of the\n   interactions of the number of posts\
    \ and number of groups.  This is\n   fuzzy purposefully, so that people will not\
    \ post a number of messages\n   just under the index and still \"get away with\
    \ it.\"  And as noted\n   above, the cancel messages have reached such a volume\

  contents:
  - "5.  Help for Beleaguered Admins\n   As a system administrator, news administrator,\
    \ local Postmaster, or\n   mailing-list administrator, your users will come to\
    \ you for help in\n   dealing with unwanted mail and posts.  First, find out what\
    \ your\n   institution's policy is regarding unwanted/unsolicited mail.  It is\n\
    \   possible that it won't do anything for you, but it is also possible\n   to\
    \ use it to justify blocking a domain which is sending particularly\n   offensive\
    \ mail to your users.  If you don't have a clear policy, it\n   would be really\
    \ useful to create one.  If you are a mailing-list\n   administrator, make sure\
    \ your mailing-list charter forbids off-topic\n   posts. If your internal-only\
    \ newsgroups are getting spammed from the\n   outside of your institution, you\
    \ probably have bigger security\n   problems than just spam.\n   Make sure that\
    \ your mail and news transports are configured to reject\n   messages injected\
    \ by parties outside your domain.  Recently\n   misconfigured Netnews servers\
    \ have become subject to hijacking by\n   spammers.  SMTP source routing <@relay.host:user@dest.host>\
    \ is\n   becoming deprecated due to its overwhelming abuse by spammers.  You\n\
    \   should configure your mail transport to reject relayed messages (when\n  \
    \ neither the sender nor the recipient are within your domain).  Check:\n    \
    \                     http://www.sendmail.org/\n   under the \"Anti-Spam\" heading.\n\
    \   If you run a firewall at your site, it can be configured in ways to\n   discourage\
    \ spam.  For example, if your firewall is a gateway host\n   that itself contains\
    \ an NNTP server, ensure that it is configured so\n   it does not allow access\
    \ from external sites except your news feeds.\n   If your firewall acts as a proxy\
    \ for an external news-server, ensure\n   that it does not accept NNTP connections\
    \ other than from your\n   internal network.  Both these potential holes have\
    \ recently been\n   exploited by spammers.  Ensure that email messages generated\
    \ within\n   your domain have proper identity information in the headers, and\
    \ that\n   users cannot forge headers.  Be sure your headers have all the\n  \
    \ correct information as stipulated by RFC 822 [5] and RFC 1123 [6].\n   If you\
    \ are running a mailing-list, allowing postings only by\n   subscribers means\
    \ a spammer would actually have to join your list\n   before sending spam messages,\
    \ which is unlikely.  Make sure your\n   charter forbids any off-topic posts.\
    \  There is another spam-related\n   problem with mailing-lists which is that\
    \ spammers like to retaliate\n   on those who work against them by mass-subscribing\
    \ their enemies to\n   mailing-lists.  Your mailing-list software should require\n\
    \   confirmation of the subscription, and only then should the address be\n  \
    \ subscribed.\n   It is possible, if you are running a mail transfer agent that\
    \ allows\n   it, to block persistant offending sites from ever getting mail into\n\
    \   your site.  However, careful consideration should be taken before\n   taking\
    \ that step.  For example, be careful not to block out sites for\n   which you\
    \ run MX records!  In the long run, it may be most useful to\n   help your users\
    \ learn enough about their mailers so that they can\n   write rules to filter\
    \ their own mail, or provide rules and kill files\n   for them to use, if they\
    \ so choose.\n   There is information about how to configure sendmail available\
    \ at\n   \"www.sendmail.org.\"  Help is also available at \"spam.abuse.net.\"\n\
    \   Another good strategy is to use Internet tools such as whois and\n   traceroute\
    \ to find which ISP is serving your problem site.  Notify\n   the postmaster or\
    \ abuse (abuse@offending-domain.example) address that\n   they have an offender.\
    \  Be sure to pass on all header information in\n   your messages to help them\
    \ with tracking down the offender.  If they\n   have a policy against using their\
    \ service to post unsolicited mail\n   they will need more than just your say-so\
    \ that there is a problem.\n   Also, the \"originating\" site may be a victim\
    \ of the offender as well.\n   It's not unknown for those sending this kind of\
    \ mail to bounce their\n   mail through dial-up accounts, or off unprotected mail\
    \ servers at\n   other sites.  Use caution and courtesy in your approach to those\
    \ who\n   look like the offender.\n   News spammers use similar techniques for\
    \ sending spam to the groups.\n   They have been known to forge headers and bounce\
    \ posts off \"open\"\n   news machines and remailers to cover their tracks.  During\
    \ the height\n   of the infamous David Rhodes \"Make Money Fast\" posts, it was\
    \ not\n   unheard of for students to walk away from terminals which were logged\n\
    \   in, and for sneaky folks to then use their accounts to forge posts,\n   much\
    \ to the later embarrassment of both the student and the\n   institution.\n  \
    \ One way to lessen problems is to avoid using mail-to URLs on your web\n   pages.\
    \  They allow email addresses to be easily harvested by those\n   institutions\
    \ grabbing email addresses off the web.  If you need to\n   have an email address\
    \ prevalent on a web page, consider using a cgi\n   script to generate the mailto\
    \ address.\n   Participate in mailing lists and news groups which discuss\n  \
    \ unsolicited mail/posts and the problems associated with it.\n   News.admin.net-abuse.misc\
    \ is probably the most well-known of these.\n"
- title: 6.  What's an ISP to Do
  contents:
  - "6.  What's an ISP to Do\n   As an Internet Service Provider, you first and foremost\
    \ should decide\n   what your stance against unsolicited mail and posts will be.\
    \  If you\n   decide not to tolerate unsolicited mail, write a clear Acceptable\
    \ Use\n   Policy which states your position and delineates consequences for\n\
    \   abuse.  If you state that you will not tolerate use of your resource\n   for\
    \ unsolicited mail/posts, and that the consequence will be loss of\n   service,\
    \ you should be able to cancel offending accounts relatively\n   quickly (after\
    \ verifying that the account really IS being mis-used).\n   If you have downstreaming\
    \ arrangements with other providers, you\n   should make sure they are aware of\
    \ any policy you set.  Likewise, you\n   should be aware of your upstream providers'\
    \ policies.\n   Consider limiting access for dialup accounts so they cannot be\
    \ used\n   by those who spew.  Make sure your mail servers aren't open for mail\n\
    \   to be bounced off them (except for legitimate users).  Make sure your\n  \
    \ mail transfer agents are the most up-to-date version (which pass\n   security\
    \ audits) of the software.\n   Educate your users about how to react to spew and\
    \ spewers.  Make sure\n   instructions for writing rules for mailers are clear\
    \ and available.\n   Support their efforts to deal with unwanted mail at the local\
    \ level -\n   taking some of the burden from your system administrators.\n   Make\
    \ sure you have an address for abuse complaints.  If complainers\n   can routinely\
    \ send mail to \"abuse@BigISP.example\" and you have\n   someone assigned to read\
    \ that mail, workflow will be much smoother.\n   Don't require people complaining\
    \ about spam to use some unique local\n   address for complaints.  Read and use\
    \ 'postmaster' and 'abuse'.  We\n   recommend adherence to RFC 2142, _Mailbox\
    \ Names for Common Services,\n   Roles and Functions._ [7].\n   Finally, write\
    \ your contracts and terms and conditions in such\n   language that allows you\
    \ to suspend service for offenders, and so\n   that you can impose a charge on\
    \ them for your costs in handling the\n   complaints their abuse generates and/or\
    \ terminating their account and\n   cleaning up the mess they make.  Some large\
    \ ISPs have found that they\n   can fund much of their abuse prevention staff\
    \ by imposing such\n   charges.  Make sure all your customers sign the agreement\
    \ before\n   their accounts are activated.  There is a list of \"good\" Acceptable\n\
    \   Use Policies and Terms of Service at:\n                http://spam.abuse.net/goodsites/index.html.\n\
    \   Legally, you may be able to stop spammers and spam relayers, but this\n  \
    \ is certainly dependent on the jurisdictions involved.  Potentially,\n   the\
    \ passing of spam via third party computers, especially if the\n   headers are\
    \ forged, could be a criminal action depending on the laws\n   of the particular\
    \ jurisdiction(s) involved.  If your site is being\n   used as a spam relay, be\
    \ sure to contact local and national criminal\n   law enforcement agencies.  Site\
    \ operators may also want to consider\n   bringing civil actions against the spammer\
    \ for expropriation of\n   property, in particular the computer time and network\
    \ bandwidth.  In\n   addition, when a mailing list is involved, there is a potential\n\
    \   intellectual property rights violation.\n   There are a few law suits in the\
    \ courts now which claim spammers\n   interfered with and endangered network connectivity.\
    \  At least one\n   company is attempting to charge spammers for the use of its\
    \ networks\n   (www.kclink.com/spam/).\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Certain actions to stop spamming may cause problems\
    \ to legitimate\n   users of the net. There is a risk that filters to stop spamming\
    \ will\n   unintentionally stop legitimate mail too. Overloading postmasters\n\
    \   with complaints about spamming may cause trouble to the wrong person,\n  \
    \ someone who is not responsible for and cannot do anything to avoid\n   the spamming\
    \ activity, or it may cause trouble out of proportion to\n   the abuse you are\
    \ complaining about.  Be sure to exercise discretion\n   and good judgment in\
    \ all these cases.  Check your local escalation\n   procedure.  The Site Security\
    \ Handbook [2] can help define an\n   escalation procedure if your site does not\
    \ have one defined.\n   Lower levels of network security interact with the ability\
    \ to trace\n   spam via logs or message headers.  Measures to stop various sorts\
    \ of\n   DNS and IP spoofing can make this information more reliable.\n   Spammers\
    \ can and will exploit obvious security weaknesses, especially\n   in NNTP servers.\
    \  This can lead to denial of service, either from the\n   sheer volume of posts,\
    \ or as a result of action taken by upstream\n   providers.\n"

  - "10. Appendix - How to Track Down Spammers\n   In a large proportion of spams\
    \ today, complaining to the postmaster\n   of the site that is the apparent sender\
    \ of a message will have little\n   effect because either the headers are forged\
    \ to disguise the source\n   of the message, or the senders of the message run\
    \ their own\n   system/domain, or both.\n   As a result, it may be necessary to\
    \ look carefully at the headers of\n   a message to see what parts are most reliable,\
    \ and/or to complain to\n   the second or third-level Internet providers who provide\
    \ Internet\n   service to a problem domain.\n   In many cases, getting reports\
    \ with full headers from various\n   recipients of a spam can help locate the\
    \ source. In extreme cases of\n   header forgery, only examination of logs on\
    \ multiple systems can\n   trace the source of a message.\n   With only one message\
    \ in hand, one has to make an educated guess as\n   to the source. The following\
    \ are only rough guidelines.\n   In the case of mail messages, \"Received:\" headers\
    \ added by systems\n   under control of the destination organization are most\
    \ likely to be\n   reliable. You can't trust what the source domain calls itself,\
    \ but\n   you can usually use the source IP address since that is determined by\n\
    \   the destination domain's server.\n   In naive mail forgeries, the \"Message-ID:\"\
    \ header may show the first\n   SMTP server to handle the message and/or the \"\
    Received:\" headers may\n   all be accurate, but neither can be relied on.  Be\
    \ especially wary\n   when the Received: headers have other headers intermixed.\
    \  Normally,\n   Received: headers are all together in a block, and when split\
    \ up, one\n   or the other blocks is probably forged.\n   In the case of news\
    \ messages, some part of the Path: header may be a\n   forgery; only reports from\
    \ multiple sites can make this clear.  In\n   naive news forgeries, the \"NNTP-Posting-Host:\"\
    \ header shows the\n   actual source, but this can be forged too.\n   If a spam\
    \ message advertises an Internet server like a WWW site, that\n   server must\
    \ be connected to the network to be usable.  Therefore that\n   address can be\
    \ traced.  It is appropriate to complain to the ISP\n   hosting a web site advertised\
    \ in a SPAM, even if the origin of the\n   spam seems to be elsewhere.  Be aware\
    \ that the spam could be an\n   attack on the advertised site; the perpetrator\
    \ knows the site will be\n   deluged with complaints and their reputation will\
    \ be damaged.  Any\n   spam with an electronic address in it is suspect because\
    \ most\n   spammers know they're unwelcome and won't make themselves accessible.\n\
    \   Here is an example mail header:\n"
