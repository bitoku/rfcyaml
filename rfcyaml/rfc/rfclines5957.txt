Abstract This document describes an IMAP protocol extension enabling server  side message sorting on the commonly displayed portion of the From and To header fields.
The [SORT] extension to the [IMAP] protocol provides a means for the server based sorting of messages.
It defines a set of sort criteria and the mechanism for determining the sort value of a message for each such ordering.
The [SORT] FROM and TO orderings sort messages lexically on the [IMAP] addr mailbox of the first address in the message's From and To headers, respectively.
This document provides two alternative orderings, DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO, which sort messages based on the first From or To address's [IMAP] addr name (generally the same as its [RFC5322] display name), when present.
A server that supports the full [SORT] extension as well as both the DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO
sort criteria indicates this by returning "SORT DISPLAY" in its CAPABILITY response.

DISPLAY Sort Value for an Address
For the purposes of the sort criteria defined in this document, the sort value for an [IMAP] address structure is defined as follows:
If the address structure's [IMAP] addr name is non NIL, apply the procedure from [RFC5255], Section 4.6.
[RFC2047] encoded words and convert the resulting character string into a charset valid for the currently active [RFC4790] collation, with a default of UTF 8.)
If the resulting octet string is not the empty string, use it as the sort value for the address.
Otherwise, if the address structure's [IMAP] addr mailbox and [IMAP] addr host are both non NIL, the sort value for the address is addr mailbox@addr host.
Otherwise, if the address structure's [IMAP] addr mailbox is non  NIL, the sort value for the address is its addr mailbox.
If none of the above conditions are met, the sort value for the address is the empty string.
This document introduces two new [SORT] sort criteria, DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO.
A message's sort value under these orderings MUST be derived as follows: A "derived addr" value is created from the [IMAP] envelope structure resulting from a FETCH ENVELOPE on the message.
For DISPLAYFROM, the derived addr value is the [IMAP] env from value.
For DISPLAYTO, the derived addr value is the [IMAP] env to value.
If the derived addr value is NIL, the message's sort value is the empty string.
Otherwise, the message's sort value is the DISPLAY sort value of the first [IMAP] address in the derived addr value.
The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus Naur Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC5234].
[IMAP] defines the non terminal "capability", and [SORT] defines "sort key".
This document defines an additional IMAP4 capability.
As such, it does not change the underlying security considerations of [IMAP].
The author believes that no new security issues are introduced with this additional IMAP4 capability.
Internationalization Considerations DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO are string based sort criteria.
As stated in [SORT], the active [RFC4790] collation as per [RFC5255] MUST be used when sorting such strings.
The DISPLAYFROM and DISPLAYTO orderings sort on the full decoded [IMAP] addr name, when present.
They do not attempt to parse this string in a locale  or language dependent manner in order to determine and sort on some semantically meaningful substring such as the surname.
IANA Considerations [IMAP] capabilities are registered by publishing a Standards Track or IESG approved Experimental RFC.
This document constitutes registration of the SORT DISPLAY capability in the [IMAP] capabilities registry.
