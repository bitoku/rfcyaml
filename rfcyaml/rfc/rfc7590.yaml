  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120]\n
    \  (along with its precursor, the so-called \"Jabber protocol\") has used\n   Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (along with its precursor,\n   Secure Sockets Layer
    or SSL) since 1999.  Both [RFC6120] and its\n   predecessor [RFC3920] provided
    recommendations regarding the use of\n   TLS in XMPP.  In order to address the
    evolving threat model on the\n   Internet today, this document provides stronger
    recommendations.\n   In particular, this document updates [RFC6120] by specifying
    that\n   XMPP implementations and deployments MUST follow the best current\n   practices
    documented in the \"Recommendations for Secure Use of TLS\n   and DTLS\" [RFC7525].
    \ This includes stronger recommendations\n   regarding SSL/TLS protocol versions,
    fallback to lower versions,\n   TLS-layer compression, TLS session resumption,
    cipher suites, public\n   key lengths, forward secrecy, and other aspects of using
    TLS with\n   XMPP.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   Various security-related terms are to be understood in the
    sense\n   defined in [RFC4949].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT
    RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Recommendations\n   The best current practices documented in the \"Recommendations
    for\n   Secure Use of TLS and DTLS\" [RFC7525] are included here by reference.\n
    \  Instead of repeating those recommendations here, this document mostly\n   provides
    supplementary information regarding secure implementation\n   and deployment of
    XMPP technologies.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Support for TLS\n   Support for TLS (specifically, the XMPP profile of
      STARTTLS) is\n   mandatory for XMPP implementations, as already specified in
      [RFC6120]\n   and its predecessor [RFC3920].\n   The server (i.e., the XMPP
      receiving entity) to which a client or\n   peer server (i.e., the XMPP initiating
      entity) connects might not\n   offer a stream feature of <starttls xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns\n
      \  :xmpp-tls'/>.  Although in general this stream feature indicates that\n   the
      server supports and offers TLS, this stream feature might be\n   stripped out
      by an attacker (see Section 2.1 of [RFC7457]).\n   Similarly, the <required/>
      child element of the <starttls/> stream\n   feature is used to indicate that
      negotiation of TLS is mandatory;\n   however, this could also be stripped out
      by an attacker.  Therefore,\n   the initiating entity MUST NOT be deterred from
      attempting TLS\n   negotiation even if the receiving entity does not advertise
      support\n   for TLS.  Instead, the initiating entity SHOULD (based on local\n
      \  policy) proceed with the stream negotiation and attempt to negotiate\n   TLS.\n"
    title: 3.1.  Support for TLS
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Compression\n   XMPP supports an application-layer compression technology
      [XEP-0138].\n   Although this XMPP extension might have slightly stronger security\n
      \  properties than TLS-layer compression (since it is enabled after\n   Simple
      Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) authentication, as\n   described in
      [XEP-0170]), this document neither encourages nor\n   discourages use of XMPP-layer
      compression.\n"
    title: 3.2.  Compression
  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Session Resumption\n   To improve the reliability of communications over
      XMPP, it is common\n   practice for clients and servers to implement the stream
      management\n   extension [XEP-0198].  Although that specification includes a
      method\n   for resumption of XMPP streams at the application layer, also using\n
      \  session resumption at the TLS layer further optimizes the overall\n   process
      of resuming an XMPP session (see [XEP-0198] for detailed\n   information).  Whether
      or not XEP-0198 is used for application-layer\n   session resumption, implementations
      MUST follow the recommendations\n   provided in [RFC7525] regarding TLS-layer
      session resumption.\n"
    title: 3.3.  Session Resumption
  - contents:
    - "3.4.  Authenticated Connections\n   Both the core XMPP specification [RFC6120]
      and the CertID\n   specification [RFC6125] provide recommendations and requirements
      for\n   certificate validation in the context of authenticated connections.\n
      \  This document does not supersede those specifications (e.g., it does\n   not
      modify the recommendations in [RFC6120] regarding the Subject\n   Alternative
      Names or other certificate details that need to be\n   supported for authentication
      of XMPP connections using PKIX\n   certificates).\n   Wherever possible, it
      is best to prefer authenticated connections\n   (along with SASL [RFC4422]),
      as already stated in the core XMPP\n   specification [RFC6120].  In particular:\n
      \  o  Clients MUST authenticate servers.\n   o  Servers MUST authenticate clients.\n
      \  o  Servers SHOULD authenticate other servers.\n   This document does not
      mandate that servers need to authenticate peer\n   servers, although such authentication
      is strongly preferred.\n   Unfortunately, in multi-tenanted environments it
      can be extremely\n   difficult to obtain and deploy PKIX certificates with the
      proper\n   Subject Alternative Names (see [XMPP-DNA] and [PKIX-POSH] for\n   details).
      \ To overcome that difficulty, the Domain Name Associations\n   (DNAs) specification
      [XMPP-DNA] describes a framework for XMPP server\n   authentication methods,
      which include not only PKIX but also DNS-\n   Based Authentication of Named
      Entities (DANE) as defined in\n   [DANE-SRV] and PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)
      as defined in\n   [PKIX-POSH].  These methods can provide a basis for server
      identity\n   verification when appropriate PKIX certificates cannot be obtained\n
      \  and deployed.\n   Given the pervasiveness of eavesdropping [RFC7258], even
      an encrypted\n   but unauthenticated connection might be better than an unencrypted\n
      \  connection in these scenarios (this is similar to the \"better-than-\n   nothing
      security\" approach for IPsec [RFC5386]).  Encrypted but\n   unauthenticated
      connections include connections negotiated using\n   anonymous Diffie-Hellman
      mechanisms or using self-signed\n   certificates, among others.  In particular
      for XMPP server-to-server\n   interactions, it can be reasonable for XMPP server
      implementations to\n   accept encrypted but unauthenticated connections when
      Server Dialback\n   keys [XEP-0220] are used; such keys on their own provide
      only weak\n   identity verification (made stronger through the use of DNSSEC\n
      \  [RFC4033]), but this at least enables encryption of server-to-server\n   connections.
      \ The DNA prooftypes mentioned above are intended to\n   mitigate the residual
      need for encrypted but unauthenticated\n   connections in these scenarios.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.5.  Server Name Indication\n   Although there is no harm in supporting the
      TLS Server Name\n   Indication (SNI) extension [RFC6066], this is not necessary
      since the\n   same function is served in XMPP by the 'to' address of the initial\n
      \  stream header as explained in Section 4.7.2 of [RFC6120].\n"
    title: 3.5.  Server Name Indication
  - contents:
    - "3.6.  Human Factors\n   It is strongly encouraged that XMPP clients provide
      ways for end\n   users (and that XMPP servers provide ways for administrators)
      to\n   complete the following tasks:\n   o  Determine if a given incoming or
      outgoing XML stream is encrypted\n      using TLS.\n   o  Determine the version
      of TLS used for encryption of a given\n      stream.\n   o  If authenticated
      encryption is used, determine how the connection\n      was authenticated or
      verified (e.g., via PKI, DANE, POSH, or\n      Server Dialback).\n   o  Inspect
      the certificate offered by an XMPP server.\n   o  Determine the cipher suite
      used to encrypt a connection.\n   o  Be warned if the certificate changes for
      a given server.\n"
    title: 3.6.  Human Factors
  title: 3.  Recommendations
- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The use of TLS can help to limit the information
    available for\n   correlation between the XMPP application layer and the underlying\n
    \  network and transport layers.  As typically deployed, XMPP\n   technologies
    do not leave application-layer routing data (such as\n   XMPP 'to' and 'from'
    addresses) at rest on intermediate systems,\n   since there is only one hop between
    any two given XMPP servers.  As a\n   result, encrypting all hops (sender's client
    to sender's server,\n   sender's server to recipient's server, and recipient's
    server to\n   recipient's client) can help to limit the amount of metadata that\n
    \  might leak.\n   It is possible that XMPP servers themselves might be compromised.
    \ In\n   that case, per-hop encryption would not protect XMPP communications,\n
    \  and even end-to-end encryption of (parts of) XMPP stanza payloads\n   would
    leave addressing information and XMPP roster data in the clear.\n   By the same
    token, it is possible that XMPP clients (or the end-user\n   devices on which
    such clients are installed) could also be\n   compromised, leaving users utterly
    at the mercy of an adversary.\n   This document and related actions to strengthen
    the security of the\n   XMPP network are based on the assumption that XMPP servers
    and\n   clients have not been subject to widespread compromise.  If this\n   assumption
    is valid, then ubiquitous use of per-hop TLS channel\n   encryption and more significant
    deployment of end-to-end object\n   encryption technologies will serve to protect
    XMPP communications to\n   a measurable degree, compared to the alternatives.\n
    \  This document covers only communication over the XMPP network and\n   does
    not take into account gateways to non-XMPP networks.  As an\n   example, for security
    considerations related to gateways between XMPP\n   and the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP), see [RFC7247] and\n   [RFC7572].\n"
