  - "1.  Introduction\n   About the purpose for DKIM, [RFC4871] states:\n      The\
    \ ultimate goal of this framework is to permit a signing domain\n      to assert\
    \ responsibility for a message, thus protecting message\n      signer identity...\n\
    \   Hence, DKIM has a signer that produces a signed message, a verifier\n   that\
    \ confirms the signature, and an assessor that consumes the\n   validated signing\
    \ domain.  So, the simple purpose of DKIM is to\n   communicate an identifier\
    \ to a receive-side assessor module.  The\n   identifier is in the form of a domain\
    \ name that refers to a\n   responsible identity.  For DKIM to be interoperable\
    \ and useful, the\n   signer and assessor must share the same understanding of\
    \ the details\n   about the identifier.\n   However, the RFC 4871 specification\
    \ defines two, potentially\n   different, identifiers that are carried in the\
    \ DKIM-Signature: header\n   field, d= and i=.  Either might be delivered to a\
    \ receiving\n   processing module that consumes validated payload.  The DKIM\n\
    \   specification fails to clearly define which is the \"payload\" to be\n   delivered\
    \ to a consuming module, versus what is internal and merely\n   in support of\
    \ achieving payload delivery.\n   This currently leaves signers and assessors\
    \ with the potential for\n   making different interpretations between the two\
    \ identifiers and may\n   lead to interoperability problems.  A signer could intend\
    \ one to be\n   used for assessment, and have a different intent in setting the\
    \ value\n   in the other.  However the verifier might choose the wrong value to\n\
    \   deliver to the assessor, thereby producing an unintended (and\n   inaccurate)\
    \ assessment.\n   This Update resolves that confusion.  It defines additional,\
    \ semantic\n   labels for the two values, clarifies their nature, and specifies\n\
    \   their relationship.  More specifically, it clarifies that the\n   identifier\
    \ intended for delivery to the assessor -- such as one that\n   consults a whitelist\
    \ -- is the value of the \"d=\" tag.  However, this\n   does not prohibit message\
    \ filtering engines from using the \"i=\" tag,\n   or any other information in\
    \ the message's header, for filtering\n   decisions.\n   For signers and verifiers\
    \ that have been using the i= tag as the\n   primary value that is delivered to\
    \ the assessor, a software change to\n   using the d= tag is intended.\n   So,\
    \ this Update clarifies the formal interface to DKIM, after\n   signature verification\
    \ has been performed.  It distinguishes DKIM's\n   internal signing and verification\
    \ activity, from its standardized\n   delivery of data to that interface.\n  \
    \ The focus of the Update is on the portion of DKIM that is much like\n   an API\
    \ definition.  If DKIM is implemented as a software library for\n   use by others,\
    \ it needs to define what outputs are provided, that is,\n   what data that an\
    \ application developer who uses the library can\n   expect to obtain as a result\
    \ of invoking DKIM on a message.\n   This Update defines the output of that library\
    \ to include the yes/no\n   result of the verification and the \"d=\" value. \
    \ In other words, it\n   says what (one) identifier was formally specified for\
    \ use by the\n   signer and whether the use of that identifier has been validated.\n\
    \   For a particular library, other information can be provided at the\n   discretion\
    \ of the library developer, since developers of assessors --\n   these are the\
    \ consumers of the DKIM library -- well might want more\n   information than the\
    \ standardized two pieces of information.\n   However, that standardized set is\
    \ the minimum that is required to be\n   provided to a consuming module, in order\
    \ to be able to claim that the\n   library is DKIM compliant.\n   This does not\
    \ state what the implicit value of \"i=\" is, relative to\n   \"d=\".  In this\
    \ context, that fact is irrelevant.\n   Another example is the difference between\
    \ the socket interface to TCP\n   versus the TCP protocol itself.  There is the\
    \ activity within the\n   protocol stack, and then there is the activity within\
    \ in the software\n   libraries that are actually used.\n   NOTE: The text provided\
    \ here updates [RFC4871].  Text appearing in\n      the \"Corrected Text:\" replaces\
    \ text in RFC 4871.  Hence,\n      references that appear in the \"Original Text:\"\

  - "12.  RFC 4871, Section 3.9, Relationship between SDID and AUID\n   Original Text:\
    \   (None.  New section.  Additional text.)\n   Corrected Text:\n      DKIM's\
    \ primary task is to communicate from the Signer to a\n      recipient-side Identity\
    \ Assessor a single Signing Domain\n      Identifier (SDID) that refers to a responsible\
    \ identity.  DKIM MAY\n      optionally provide a single responsible Agent or\
    \ User Identifier\n      (AUID).\n      Hence, DKIM's mandatory output to a receive-side\
    \ Identity Assessor\n      is a single domain name.  Within the scope of its use\
    \ as DKIM\n      output, the name has only basic domain name semantics; any\n\
    \      possible owner-specific semantics are outside the scope of DKIM.\n    \
    \  That is, within its role as a DKIM identifier, additional\n      semantics\
    \ cannot be assumed by an Identity Assessor.\n      A receive-side DKIM verifier\
    \ MUST communicate the Signing Domain\n      Identifier (d=) to a consuming Identity\
    \ Assessor module and MAY\n      communicate the Agent or User Identifier (i=)\
    \ if present.\n      To the extent that a receiver attempts to intuit any structured\n\
    \      semantics for either of the identifiers, this is a heuristic\n      function\
    \ that is outside the scope of DKIM's specification and\n      semantics.  Hence,\
    \ it is relegated to a higher-level service, such\n      as a delivery handling\
    \ filter that integrates a variety of inputs\n      and performs heuristic analysis\
    \ of them.\n      INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION: This document does not require the value\n\
    \      of the SDID or AUID to match the identifier in any other message\n    \
    \  header field.  This requirement is, instead, an assessor policy\n      issue.\
    \  The purpose of such a linkage would be to authenticate the\n      value in\
    \ that other header field.  This, in turn, is the basis for\n      applying a\
    \ trust assessment based on the identifier value.  Trust\n      is a broad and\
    \ complex topic and trust mechanisms are subject to\n      highly creative attacks.\
    \  The real-world efficacy of any but the\n      most basic bindings between the\
    \ SDID or AUID and other identities\n      is not well established, nor is its\
    \ vulnerability to subversion by\n      an attacker.  Hence, reliance on the use\
    \ of such bindings should\n      be strictly limited.  In particular, it is not\
    \ at all clear to\n      what extent a typical end-user recipient can rely on\
    \ any\n      assurances that might be made by successful use of the SDID or\n\
    \      AUID.\n"
