- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n    The NICNAME/WHOIS Server is an NCP/TCP transaction based\n\
    \   query/response server, running on the SRI-NIC machine, that\n   provides netwide\
    \ directory service to ARPANET users.  It is\n   one of a series of ARPANET/Internet\
    \ name services maintained\n   by the Network Information Center (NIC) at SRI\
    \ International\n   on behalf of the Defense Communications Agency (DCA).  The\n\
    \   server is accessible across the ARPANET from user programs\n   running on\
    \ local hosts, and it delivers the full name, U.S.\n   mailing address, telephone\
    \ number, and network mailbox for\n   ARPANET users.\n   This server, together\
    \ with the corresponding Identification\n   Data Base provides online directory\
    \ look-up equivalent to the\n   ARPANET Directory.  DCA strongly encourages network\
    \ hosts to\n   provide their users with access to this network service.\n"
- title: WHO SHOULD BE IN THE DATA BASE
  contents:
  - "WHO SHOULD BE IN THE DATA BASE\n   DCA requests that each individual with a directory\
    \ on an\n   ARPANET host, who is capable of passing traffic across the\n   ARPANET,\
    \ be registered in the NIC Identification Data Base.\n   To register, send full\
    \ name, middle initial, U.S. mailing\n   address (including mail stop and full\
    \ explanation of\n   abbreviations and acronyms), ZIP code, telephone (including\n\
    \   Autovon and FTS, if available), and one network mailbox, via\n   electronic\
    \ mail to NIC@SRI-NIC.\n"
- title: PROTOCOL
  contents:
  - "PROTOCOL\n   The NICNAME protocol is similar to the NAME/FINGER protocol\n  \
    \ (RFC 742).  To access the server:\n   Connect to the service host (SRI-NIC)\n\
    \      TCP: service port 43 decimal\n      NCP: ICP to socket 43 decimal, establishing\
    \ two 8-bit\n   connections\n   Send a single \"command line\", ending with <CRLF>.\n\
    \   Receive information in response to the command line.  The\n   server closes\
    \ its connections as soon as the output is\n   finished.\n                   \
    \                                        NICNAME/WHOIS\n"
- title: EXISTING USER PROGRAMS
  contents:
  - "EXISTING USER PROGRAMS\n   NICNAME has been chosen as the global name for the\
    \ user\n   program, although some sites may choose to use the more\n   familiar\
    \ name of \"WHOIS\".  There are versions of NICNAME for\n   Tenex, Tops-20, and\
    \ Unix.  The Tenex and Tops-20 programs are\n   written in assembly language (FAIL/MACRO),\
    \ and the Unix\n   version is written in C.  They are easy to invoke, taking one\n\
    \   argument which is passed directly to the NICNAME server at\n   SRI-NIC.  Normally\
    \ it is best to use the NIC-supplied\n   programs, if possible, since the protocol\
    \ will continue to\n   evolve.  Contact NIC@SRI-NIC for copies.\n"
- title: COMMAND LINES AND REPLIES
  contents:
  - "COMMAND LINES AND REPLIES\n   A command line is normally a single name specification.\
    \  The\n   easiest way to obtain the most recent documentation on name\n   specifications\
    \ is to give the server a command line consisting\n   of \"?<CRLF>\" (that is,\
    \ a question-mark alone as the name\n   specification).  The response from the\
    \ NICNAME server will\n   list all possible formats that can be used.\n   The\
    \ responses are not currently intended to be\n   machine-readable; the information\
    \ is meant to be passed back\n   directly to a human user.  The following three\
    \ examples will\n   illustrate the use of NICNAME.\n"

  contents:
  - "Response:\n      Please enter a name or a handle (\"ident\"), such as \"Smith\"\
    \n   or \"SRI-NIC\".  Starting with a period forces a name-only\n   search;\n\
    \   starting with exclamation point forces handle-only.  Examples:\n      Smith\
    \                   [looks for name or handle SMITH ]\n      !SRI-NIC        \
    \        [looks for handle SRI-NIC only  ]\n      .Smith, John            [looks\
    \ for name JOHN SMITH only ]\n   Adding \"...\" to the argument will match anything\
    \ from that\n   point,\n   e.g. \"ZU...\" will match ZUL, ZUM, etc.\n      To\
    \ have the ENTIRE membership list of a group or\n   organization,\n   if you are\
    \ asking about a group or org, shown with the record,\n   use\n   an asterisk\
    \ character \"*\" directly preceding the given\n   argument.\n   [CAUTION: If\
    \ there are a lot of members this will take a long\n   time!]\n   You may of course\
    \ use exclamation point and asterisk, or a\n   period\n   and asterisk together.\n"
