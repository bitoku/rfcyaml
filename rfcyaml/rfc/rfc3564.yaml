- title: 1.1.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Problem Statement\n   Diff-Serv is used by some Service Providers to achieve\
    \ scalable\n   network designs supporting multiple classes of services.\n   In\
    \ some such Diff-Serv networks, where optimization of transmission\n   resources\
    \ on a network-wide basis is not sought, MPLS Traffic\n   Engineering (TE) mechanisms\
    \ may not be used.\n   In other networks, where optimization of transmission resources\
    \ is\n   sought, Diff-Serv mechanisms [DIFF-MPLS] may be complemented by\n   MPLS\
    \ Traffic Engineering mechanisms [TE-REQ] [ISIS-TE] [OSPF-TE]\n   [RSVP-TE] which\
    \ operate on an aggregate basis across all\n   Diff-Serv classes of service. \
    \ In this case, Diff-Serv and MPLS TE\n   both provide their respective benefits.\n\
    \   To achieve fine-grained optimization of transmission resources and\n   further\
    \ enhanced network performance and efficiency, as discussed in\n   [TEWG-FW],\
    \ it may be desirable to perform traffic engineering at a\n   per-class level\
    \ instead of at an aggregate level.  By mapping the\n   traffic from a given Diff-Serv\
    \ class of service on a separate LSP, it\n   allows this traffic to utilize resources\
    \ available to the given class\n   on both shortest paths and non-shortest paths,\
    \ and follow paths that\n   meet engineering constraints which are specific to\
    \ the given class.\n   This is what we refer to as \"Diff-Serv-aware Traffic Engineering\n\
    \   (DS-TE)\".\n   This document focuses exclusively on the specific environments\
    \ which\n   would benefit from DS-TE.  Some examples include:\n     -    networks\
    \ where bandwidth is scarce (e.g., transcontinental\n          networks)\n   \
    \  -    networks with significant amounts of delay-sensitive traffic\n     - \
    \   networks where the relative proportion of traffic across\n          classes\
    \ of service is not uniform\n   This document focuses on intra-domain operation.\
    \  Inter-domain\n   operation is not considered.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Definitions\n   For the convenience of the reader, relevant Diff-Serv ([DIFF-ARCH],\n\
    \   [DIFF-NEW] and [DIFF-PDB]) definitions are repeated herein.\n      Behavior\
    \ Aggregate (BA): a collection of packets with the same\n      (Diff-Serv) codepoint\
    \ crossing a link in a particular direction.\n      Per-Hop-Behavior (PHB): the\
    \ externally observable forwarding\n      behavior applied at a DS-compliant node\
    \ to a Diff-Serv behavior\n      aggregate.\n      PHB Scheduling Class (PSC):\
    \ A PHB group for which a common\n      constraint is that ordering of at least\
    \ those packets belonging to\n      the same microflow must be preserved.\n  \
    \    Ordered Aggregate (OA): a set of BAs that share an ordering\n      constraint.\
    \  The set of PHBs that are applied to this set of\n      Behavior Aggregates\
    \ constitutes a PHB scheduling class.\n      Traffic Aggregate (TA): a collection\
    \ of packets with a codepoint\n      that maps to the same PHB, usually in a DS\
    \ domain or some subset\n      of a DS domain.  A traffic aggregate marked for\
    \ the foo PHB is\n      referred to as the \"foo traffic aggregate\" or \"foo\
    \ aggregate\"\n      interchangeably.  This generalizes the concept of Behavior\n\
    \      Aggregate from a link to a network.\n      Per-Domain Behavior (PDB): the\
    \ expected treatment that an\n      identifiable or target group of packets will\
    \ receive from\n      \"edge-to-edge\" of a DS domain.  A particular PHB (or,\
    \ if\n      applicable, list of PHBs) and traffic conditioning requirements\n\
    \      are associated with each PDB.\n   We also repeat the following definition\
    \ from [TE-REQ]:\n      Traffic Trunk: an aggregation of traffic flows of the\
    \ same class\n      which are placed inside a Label Switched Path.\n   In the\
    \ context of the present document, \"flows of the same class\" is\n   to be interpreted\
    \ as \"flows from the same Forwarding Equivalence\n   Class which are to be treated\
    \ equivalently from the DS-TE\n   perspective\".\n      We refer to the set of\
    \ TAs corresponding to the set of PHBs of a\n      given PSC, as a {TA}PSC.  A\
    \ given {TA}PSC will receive the\n      treatment of the PDB associated with the\
    \ corresponding PSC.  In\n      this document, we also loosely refer to a {TA}PSC\
    \ as a \"Diff-Serv\n      class of service\", or a \"class of service\".  As an\
    \ example, the\n      set of packets within a DS domain with a codepoint that\
    \ maps to\n      the EF PHB may form one {TA}PSC in that domain.  As another\n\
    \      example, the set of packets within a DS domain with a codepoint\n     \
    \ that maps to the AF11 or AF12 or AF13 PHB may form another {TA}PSC\n      in\
    \ that domain.\n   We refer to the collection of packets which belong to a given\
    \ Traffic\n   Aggregate and are associated with a given MPLS Forwarding Equivalence\n\
    \   Class (FEC) ([MPLS-ARCH]) as a <FEC/TA>.\n   We refer to the set of <FEC/TA>\
    \ whose TAs belong to a given {TA}PSC\n   as a <FEC/{TA}PSC>.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Mapping of traffic to LSPs
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Mapping of traffic to LSPs\n   A network may have multiple Traffic Aggregates\
    \ (TAs) it wishes to\n   service.  Recalling from [DIFF-MPLS], there are several\
    \ options on\n   how the set of <FEC/{TA}PSC> of a given FEC can be split into\
    \ Traffic\n   Trunks for mapping onto LSPs when running MPLS Traffic Engineering.\n\
    \   One option is to not split this set of <FEC/{TA}PSC> so that each\n   Traffic\
    \ Trunk comprises traffic from all the {TA}/PSC.  This option\n   is typically\
    \ used when aggregate traffic engineering is deployed\n   using current MPLS TE\
    \ mechanisms.  In that case, all the\n   <FEC/{TA}PSC> of a given FEC are routed\
    \ collectively according to a\n   single shared set of constraints and will follow\
    \ the same path.  Note\n   that the LSP transporting such a Traffic Trunk is,\
    \ by definition, an\n   E-LSP as defined in [DIFF-MPLS].\n   Another option is\
    \ to split the different <FEC/{TA}PSC> of a given FEC\n   into multiple Traffic\
    \ Trunks on the basis of the {TA}PSC.  In other\n   words, traffic, from one given\
    \ node to another, is split, based on\n   the \"classes of service\", into multiple\
    \ Traffic Trunks which are\n   transported over separate LSP and can potentially\
    \ follow different\n   paths through the network.  DS-TE takes advantage of this\
    \ and\n   computes a separate path for each LSP.  In so doing, DS-TE can take\n\
    \   into account the specific requirements of the Traffic Trunk\n   transported\
    \ on each LSP (e.g., bandwidth requirement, preemption\n   priority).  Moreover\
    \ DS-TE can take into account the specific\n   engineering constraints to be enforced\
    \ for these sets of Traffic\n   Trunks (e.g., limit all Traffic Trunks transporting\
    \ a particular\n   {TA}PSC to x% of link capacity).  DS-TE achieves per LSP constraint\n\
    \   based routing with paths that match specific objectives of the\n   traffic\
    \ while forming the corresponding Traffic Trunk.\n   For simplicity, and because\
    \ this is the specific topic of this\n   document, the above paragraphs in this\
    \ section only considered\n   splitting traffic of a given FEC into multiple Traffic\
    \ Aggregates on\n   the basis of {TA}PSC.  However, it should be noted that, in\
    \ addition\n   to this, traffic from every {TA}PSC may also be split into multiple\n\
    \   Traffic Trunks for load balancing purposes.\n"

- title: '2.1.  Scenario 1: Limiting Proportion of Classes on a Link'
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Scenario 1: Limiting Proportion of Classes on a Link\n   An IP/MPLS network\
    \ may need to carry a significant amount of VoIP\n   traffic compared to its link\
    \ capacity.  For example, 10,000\n   uncompressed calls at 20ms packetization\
    \ result in about 1Gbps of IP\n   traffic, which is significant on an OC-48c based\
    \ network.  In case of\n   topology changes such as link/node failure, VoIP traffic\
    \ levels can\n   even approach the full bandwidth on certain links.\n   For delay/jitter\
    \ reasons, some network administrators see it as\n   undesirable to carry more\
    \ than a certain percentage of VoIP traffic\n   on any link.  The rest of the\
    \ available link bandwidth can be used to\n   route other \"classes of service\"\
    \ corresponding to delay/jitter\n   insensitive traffic (e.g.,  Best Effort Internet\
    \ traffic).  The exact\n   determination of this \"certain\" percentage is outside\
    \ the scope of\n   this requirements document.\n   During normal operations, the\
    \ VoIP traffic should be able to preempt\n   other \"classes of service\" (if\
    \ these other classes are designated as\n   preemptable and they have lower preemption\
    \ priority), so that it will\n   be able to use the shortest available path, only\
    \ constrained by the\n   maximum defined link utilization ratio/percentage of\
    \ the VoIP class.\n   Existing TE mechanisms only allow constraint based routing\
    \ of traffic\n   based on a single bandwidth constraint common to all \"classes\
    \ of\n   service\", which does not satisfy the needs described here.  This\n \
    \  leads to the requirement for DS-TE to be able to enforce a different\n   bandwidth\
    \ constraint for different \"classes of service\".  In the\n   above example,\
    \ the bandwidth constraint to be enforced for VoIP\n   traffic may be the \"certain\"\
    \ percentage of each link capacity, while\n   the bandwidth constraint to be enforced\
    \ for the rest of the \"classes\n   of service\" might have their own constraints\
    \ or have access to the\n   rest of the link capacity.\n"
- title: '2.2.  Scenario 2: Maintain relative proportion of traffic'
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Scenario 2: Maintain relative proportion of traffic\n   Suppose an IP/MPLS\
    \ network supports 3 \"classes of service\".  The\n   network administrator wants\
    \ to perform Traffic Engineering to\n   distribute the traffic load.  Also assume\
    \ that proportion across\n   \"classes of service\" varies significantly depending\
    \ on the\n   source/destination POPs.\n   With existing TE mechanisms, the proportion\
    \ of traffic from each\n   \"class of service\" on a given link will vary depending\
    \ on multiple\n   factors including:\n   - in which order the different TE-LSPs\
    \ are established\n   - the preemption priority associated with the different\
    \ TE-LSPs\n   - link/node failure situations\n   This may make it difficult or\
    \ impossible for the network\n   administrator to configure the Diff-Serv PHBs\
    \ (e.g., queue bandwidth)\n   to ensure that each \"class of service\" gets the\
    \ appropriate\n   treatment.  This leads again to the requirement for DS-TE to\
    \ be able\n   to enforce a different bandwidth constraint for different \"classes\
    \ of\n   service\".  This could be used to ensure that, regardless of the order\n\
    \   in which tunnels are routed, regardless of their preemption priority\n   and\
    \ regardless of the failure situation, the amount of traffic of\n   each \"class\
    \ of service\" routed over a link matches the Diff-Serv\n   scheduler configuration\
    \ on that link to the corresponding class\n   (e.g., queue bandwidth).\n   As\
    \ an illustration of how DS-TE would address this scenario, the\n   network administrator\
    \ may configure the service rate of Diff-Serv\n   queues to (45%,35%,20%) for\
    \ \"classes of service\" (1,2,3)\n   respectively.  The administrator would then\
    \ split the traffic into\n   separate Traffic Trunks for each \"class of service\"\
    \ and associate a\n   bandwidth to each LSP transporting those Traffic Trunks.\
    \  The network\n   administrator may also want to configure preemption priorities\
    \ of\n   each LSP in order to give highest restoration priority to the highest\n\
    \   priority \"class of service\" and medium priority to the medium \"class\n\
    \   of service\".  Then DS-TE could ensure that after a failure, \"class of\n\
    \   service\" 1 traffic would be rerouted with first access at link\n   capacity\
    \ without exceeding its service rate of 45% of the link\n   bandwidth.  \"Class\
    \ of service\" 2 traffic would be rerouted with\n   second access at the link\
    \ capacity without exceeding its allotment.\n   Note that where \"class of service\"\
    \ 3 is the Best-Effort service, the\n   requirement on DS-TE may be to ensure\
    \ that the total amount of\n   traffic routed across all \"classes of service\"\
    \ does not exceed the\n   total link capacity of 100% (as opposed to separately\
    \ limiting the\n   amount of Best Effort traffic to 20 even if there was little\
    \ \"class\n   of service\" 1 and \"class of service\" 2 traffic).\n   In this\
    \ scenario, DS-TE would allow for the maintenance of a more\n   steady distribution\
    \ of \"classes of service\", even during rerouting.\n   This would rely on the\
    \ required capability of DS-TE to adjust the\n   amount of traffic of each \"\
    class of service\"  routed on a link based\n   on the configuration of the scheduler\
    \ and the amount of bandwidth\n   available for each \"class of service\".\n \
    \  Alternatively, some network administrators may want to solve the\n   problem\
    \ by having the scheduler dynamically adjusted based on the\n   amount of bandwidth\
    \ of the LSPs admitted for each \"class of service\".\n   This is an optional\
    \ additional requirement on the DS-TE solution.\n"
- title: '2.3.  Scenario 3: Guaranteed Bandwidth Services'
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Scenario 3: Guaranteed Bandwidth Services\n   In addition to the Best effort\
    \ service, an IP/MPLS network operator\n   may desire to offer a point-to-point\
    \ \"guaranteed bandwidth\" service\n   whereby the provider pledges to provide\
    \ a given level of performance\n   (bandwidth/delay/loss...) end-to-end through\
    \ its network from an\n   ingress port to an egress port.  The goal is to ensure\
    \ that all the\n   \"guaranteed\" traffic under the scope of a subscribed service\
    \ level\n   specification, will be delivered within the tolerances of this\n \
    \  service level specification.\n   One approach for deploying such \"guaranteed\"\
    \ service involves:\n   - dedicating a Diff-Serv PHB (or a Diff-Serv PSC as defined\
    \ in\n     [DIFF-NEW]) to the \"guaranteed\" traffic\n   - policing guaranteed\
    \ traffic on ingress against the traffic contract\n     and marking the \"guaranteed\"\
    \ packets with the corresponding\n     DSCP/EXP value\n   Where a very high level\
    \ of performance is targeted for the\n   \"guaranteed\" service, it may be necessary\
    \ to ensure that the amount\n   of \"guaranteed\" traffic remains below a given\
    \ percentage of link\n   capacity on every link.  Where the proportion of \"guaranteed\"\
    \ traffic\n   is high, constraint based routing can be used to enforce such a\n\
    \   constraint.\n   However, the network operator may also want to simultaneously\
    \ perform\n   Traffic Engineering for the rest of the traffic (i.e.,\n   non-guaranteed\
    \ traffic) which would require that constraint based\n   routing is also capable\
    \ of enforcing a different bandwidth\n   constraint, which would be less stringent\
    \ than the one for guaranteed\n   traffic.\n   Again, this combination of requirements\
    \ can not be addressed with\n   existing TE mechanisms.  DS-TE mechanisms allowing\
    \ enforcement of a\n   different bandwidth constraint for guaranteed traffic and\
    \ for\n   non-guaranteed traffic are required.\n"

  - "3.1.  DS-TE Compatibility\n   Since DS-TE may impact scalability (as discussed\
    \ later in this\n   document) and operational practices, DS-TE is expected to\
    \ be used\n   when existing TE mechanisms combined with Diff-Serv cannot address\n\
    \   the network design requirements (i.e., where constraint based routing\n  \
    \ is required and where it needs to enforce different bandwidth\n   constraints\
    \ for different \"classes of service\", such as in the\n   scenarios described\
    \ above in section 2).  Where the benefits of DSTE\n   are only required in a\

- title: 3.2.  Class-Types
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Class-Types\n   The fundamental requirement for DS-TE is to be able to\
    \ enforce\n   different bandwidth constraints for different sets of Traffic Trunks.\n\
    \   [TEWG-FW] introduces the concept of Class-Types when discussing\n   operations\
    \ of MPLS Traffic Engineering in a Diff-Serv environment.\n   We refine this definition\
    \ into the following:\n            Class-Type (CT): the set of Traffic Trunks\
    \ crossing a link,\n            that is governed by a specific set of Bandwidth\
    \ constraints.\n            CT is used for the purposes of link bandwidth allocation,\n\
    \            constraint based routing and admission control.  A given\n      \
    \      Traffic Trunk belongs to the same CT on all links.\n   Note that different\
    \ LSPs transporting Traffic Trunks from the same CT\n   may be using the same\
    \ or different preemption priorities as explained\n   in more details in section\
    \ 3.4 below.\n   Mapping of {TA}PSC to Class-Types is flexible.  Different {TA}PSC\
    \ can\n   be mapped to different CTs, multiple {TA}PSC can be mapped to the\n\
    \   same CT and one {TA}PSC can be mapped to multiple CTs.\n   For illustration\
    \ purposes, let's consider the case of a network\n   running 4 Diff-Serv PDBs\
    \ which are respectively based on the EF PHB\n   [EF], the AF1x PSC [AF], the\
    \ AF2x PSC and the Default (i.e.,\n   Best-Effort) PHB [DIFF-FIELD].  The network\
    \ administrator may decide\n   to deploy DS-TE in the following way:\n       \
    \  o  from every DS-TE Head-end to every DS-TE Tail-end, split the\n         \
    \   traffic into 4 Traffic Trunks: one for traffic of each\n            {TA}PSC\n\
    \         o  because the QoS objectives for the AF1x PDB and for the AF2x\n  \
    \          PDB may be of similar nature (e.g., both targeting low loss\n     \
    \       albeit at different levels perhaps), the same (set of)\n            Bandwidth\
    \ Constraint(s) may be applied collectively over the\n            AF1x Traffic\

    \ of CT, each CT is assigned either a Bandwidth\n   Constraint, or a set of Bandwidth\
    \ Constraints.\n   We refer to the Bandwidth Constraints as BCb, 0 <= b <= MaxBC-1\n\
    \   For a given Class-Type CTc, 0 <= c <= MaxCT-1, let us define\n   \"Reserved(CTc)\"\
    \ as the sum of the bandwidth reserved by all\n   established LSPs which belong\
    \ to CTc.\n   Different models of Bandwidth Constraints are conceivable for control\n\
    \   of the CTs.\n   For example, a model with one separate Bandwidth Constraint\
    \ per CT\n   could be defined.  This model is referred to as the \"Maximum\n \
    \  Allocation Model\" and is defined by:\n        - MaxBC= MaxCT\n        - for\
    \ each value of b in the range 0 <= b <= (MaxCT - 1):\n               Reserved\

    \ where\n   three CTs are used, the network administrator might then configure\n\
    \   BC0=20, BC1= 50, BC2=30 such that:\n   - All LSPs supporting Traffic Trunks\

    \   - All LSPs supporting Traffic Trunks from CT0 use no more than 20\n     (e.g.,\

    \ models.  Additional Bandwidth\n   Constraints models MAY also be specified at\
    \ a later stage if deemed\n   useful based on operational experience from DS-TE\

- title: 3.4.  Preemption and TE-Classes
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Preemption and TE-Classes\n   [TEWG-FW] defines the notion of preemption\
    \ and preemption priority.\n   The DS-TE solution MUST retain full support of\
    \ such preemption.\n   However, a network administrator preferring not to use\
    \ preemption for\n   user traffic MUST be able to disable the preemption mechanisms\n\
    \   described below.\n   The preemption attributes defined in [TE-REQ] MUST be\
    \ retained and\n   applicable across all Class Types.  The preemption attributes\
    \ of\n   setup priority and holding priority MUST retain existing semantics,\n\
    \   and in particular these semantics MUST not be affected by the Ordered\n  \
    \ Aggregate transported by the LSP or by the LSP's Class Type.  This\n   means\
    \ that if LSP1 contends with LSP2 for resources, LSP1 may preempt\n   LSP2 if\
    \ LSP1 has a higher set-up preemption priority (i.e., lower\n   numerical priority\
    \ value) than LSP2's holding preemption priority\n   regardless of LSP1's OA/CT\
    \ and LSP2's OA/CT.\n   We introduce the following definition:\n       TE-Class:\
    \ A pair of:\n               (i)    a Class-Type\n               (ii)   a preemption\
    \ priority allowed for that\n                      Class-Type.  This means that\
    \ an LSP transporting a\n                      Traffic Trunk from that Class-Type\
    \ can use that\n                      preemption priority as the set-up priority,\
    \ as the\n                      holding priority or both.\n   Note that by definition:\n\
    \   - for a given Class-Type, there may be one or multiple\n     TE-classes using\
    \ that Class-Type, each using a different preemption\n     priority\n   - for\
    \ a given preemption priority, there may be one or multiple\n     TE-Class(es)\
    \ using that preemption priority, each using a different\n     Class-Type.\n \
    \  The DS-TE solution MUST allow all LSPs transporting Traffic Trunks of\n   a\
    \ given Class-Type to use the same preemption priority.  In other\n   words, the\
    \ DS-TE solution MUST allow a Class-Type to be used by\n   single TE-Class.  This\
    \ effectively allows the network administrator\n   to ensure that no preemption\
    \ happens within that Class-Type, when so\n   desired.\n   As an example, the\
    \ DS-TE solution MUST allow the network\n   administrator to define a Class-Type\
    \ comprising a single TE-class\n   using preemption 0.\n   The DS-TE solution\
    \ MUST allow two LSPs transporting Traffic Trunks of\n   the same Class-Type to\
    \ use different preemption priorities, and allow\n   the LSP with higher (numerically\
    \ lower) set-up priority to preempt\n   the LSP with lower (numerically higher)\
    \ holding priority when they\n   contend for resources.  In other words, the DS-TE\
    \ solution MUST allow\n   multiple TE-Classes to be defined for a given Class-Type.\
    \ This\n   effectively allows the network administrator to enable preemption\n\
    \   within a Class-Type, when so desired.\n   As an example, the DS-TE solution\
    \ MUST allow the network\n   administrator to define a Class-Type comprising three\
    \ TE-Classes; one\n   using preemption 0, one using preemption 1 and one using\
    \ preemption\n   4.\n   The DS-TE solution MUST allow two LSPs transporting Traffic\
    \ Trunks\n   from different Class-Types to use different preemption priorities,\n\
    \   and allow the LSP with higher setup priority to preempt the one with\n   lower\
    \ holding priority when they contend for resources.\n   As an example, the DS-TE\
    \ solution MUST allow the network\n   administrator to define two Class-Types\
    \ (CT0 and CT1) each comprising\n   two TE-Classes where say:\n      -one TE-Class\
    \ groups CT0 and preemption 0\n      -one TE-Class groups CT0 and preemption 2\n\
    \      -one TE-Class groups CT1 and preemption 1\n      -one TE-Class groups CT1\
    \ and preemption 3\n   The network administrator would then, in particular, be\
    \ able to:\n   - transport a CT0 Traffic Trunk over an LSP with setup priority=0\
    \ and\n     holding priority=0\n   - transport a CT0 Traffic Trunk over an LSP\
    \ with setup priority=2 and\n     holding priority=0\n   - transport a CT1 Traffic\
    \ Trunk over an LSP with setup priority=1 and\n     holding priority=1\n   - transport\
    \ a CT1 Traffic Trunk over an LSP with setup priority=3 and\n     holding priority=1.\n\
    \   The network administrator would then, in particular, NOT be able to:\n   -\
    \ transport a CT0 Traffic Trunk over an LSP with setup priority=1 and\n     holding\
    \ priority=1\n   - transport a CT1 Traffic Trunk over an LSP with setup priority=0\
    \ and\n     holding priority=0\n   The DS-TE solution MUST allow two LSPs transporting\
    \ Traffic Trunks\n   from different Class-Types to use the same preemption priority.\
    \  In\n   other words, the DS-TE solution MUST allow TE-classes using different\n\
    \   CTs to use the same preemption priority.  This effectively allows the\n  \
    \ network administrator to ensure that no preemption happens across\n   Class-Types,\
    \ if so desired.\n   As an example, the DS-TE solution MUST allow the network\n\
    \   administrator to define three Class-Types (CT0, CT1 and CT2) each\n   comprising\
    \ one TE-Class which uses preemption 0.  In that case, no\n   preemption will\
    \ ever occur.\n   Since there are 8 preemption priorities and up to 8 Class-Types,\n\
    \   there could theoretically be up to 64 TE-Classes in a network.  This\n   is\
    \ felt to be beyond current practical requirements.  The current\n   practical\
    \ requirement is that the DS-TE solution MUST allow support\n   for up to 8 TE-classes.\
    \  The DS-TE solution MUST allow these\n   TE-classes to comprise any arbitrary\
    \ subset of 8 (or less) from the\n   (64) possible combinations of (8) Class-Types\
    \ and (8) preemption\n   priorities.\n   As with existing TE, an LSP which gets\
    \ preempted is torn down at\n   preemption time.  The Head-end of the preempted\
    \ LSP may then attempt\n   to reestablish that LSP, which involves re-computing\
    \ a path by\n   Constraint Based Routing based on updated available bandwidth\n\
    \   information and then signaling for LSP establishment along the new\n   path.\
    \  It is to be noted that there may be cases where the preempted\n   LSP cannot\
    \ be reestablished (e.g., no possible path satisfying LSP\n   bandwidth constraints\
    \ as well as other constraints).  In such cases,\n   the Head-end behavior is\
    \ left to implementation.  It may involve\n   periodic attempts at reestablishing\
    \ the LSP, relaxing of the LSP\n   constraints, or other behaviors.\n"
