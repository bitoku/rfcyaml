  - "                    3rd Level Ideas and other Noises\nOn 12 August 70, I met\
    \ a BBN with representatives from BBN and MIT and\nwe discussed third llevel protocol.\n\
    Dial-up The following proposed dial-up protocol was agreed upon at the\nmeeting.\n\
    The purpose of this piece of protocol is to get a process at one site\n(hereafter\
    \ the using site) in contact with the logger at the other site\n(hereafter the\
    \ serving site).\nTo initiate contact, the using process attaches a receive socket\
    \ US and\nrequests connection to socket 1 in the serving host. The using NCP thus\n\
    sends\n               1            4               4                 1\n     \

    \ |     P    |    space    |\nover link 1, where US is the user's receive socket,\
    \ p is the link, and\nspace is some nominal spae allocation.\nThe serving Host\
    \ may decide to refuse contact, in which case it will\nrespond with the standard\
    \ CLS. If it accepts contact, however, it will\nsend exactly an even 32 bit number\
    \ over the connection and close the\nconnection. This even 32 bit number is the\
    \ name of a receive socket in\nthe serving Host. This socket and the next higher\
    \ numbered socket are\nNetwork Working Group                                 \

    Standard Console\n    We next agreed on an initial network standard console: 7-bit\

    \ for all others.\n    For break or interrupt many systems use one of the standard\n\
