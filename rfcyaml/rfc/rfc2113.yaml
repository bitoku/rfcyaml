  title: Status of this Memo
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo describes a new IP Option type that alerts transit routers\n
    \  to more closely examine the contents of an IP packet.  This is useful\n   for,
    but not limited to, new protocols that are addressed to a\n   destination but
    require relatively complex processing in routers\n   along the path.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.0  Introduction\n   A recent trend in routing protocols is to loosely couple
    new routing\n   functionality to existing unicast routing.  The motivation for
    this\n   is simple and elegant -- it allows deployment of new routing\n   functionality
    without having to reinvent all of the basic routing\n   protocol functions, greatly
    reducing specification and implementation\n   complexity.\n   The downside of
    this is that the new functionality can only depend on\n   the least common denominator
    in unicast routing, the next hop toward\n   the destination.  No assumptions can
    be made about the existence of\n   more richly detailed information (such as a
    link state database).\n   It is also desirable to be able to gradually deploy
    the new\n   technology, specifically to avoid having to upgrade all routers in\n
    \  the path between source and destination.  This goal is somewhat at\n   odds
    with the least common denominator information available, since a\n   router that
    is not immediately adjacent to another router supporting\n   the new protocol
    has no way of determining the location or identity\n   of other such routers (unless
    something like a flooding algorithm is\n   implemented over unicast forwarding,
    which conflicts with the\n   simplicity goal).\n   One obvious approach to leveraging
    unicast routing is to do hop-by-\n   hop forwarding of the new protocol packets
    along the path toward the\n   ultimate destination.  Each system that implements
    the new protocol\n   would be responsible for addressing the packet to the next
    system in\n   the path that understood it.  As noted above, however, it is\n   difficult
    to know the next system implementing the protocol.  The\n   simple, degenerate
    case is to assume that every system along the path\n   implements the protocol.
    \ This is a barrier to phased deployment of\n   the new protocol, however.\n   RSVP
    [1] finesses the problem by instead putting the address of the\n   ultimate destination
    in the IP Destination Address field, and then\n   asking that every RSVP router
    make a \"small change in its ...\n   forwarding path\" to look for the specific
    RSVP packet type and pull\n   such packets out of the mainline forwarding path,
    performing local\n   processing on the packets before forwarding them on.  This
    has the\n   decided advantage of allowing automatic tunneling through routers\n
    \  that don't understand RSVP, since the packets will naturally flow\n   toward
    the ultimate destination.  However, the performance cost of\n   making this Small
    Change may be unacceptable, since the mainline\n   forwarding path of routers
    tends to be highly tuned--even the\n   addition of a single instruction may incur
    penalties of hundreds of\n   packets per second in performance.\n"

    - "2.0  Router Alert Option\n   The goal, then, is to provide a mechanism whereby
      routers can\n   intercept packets not addressed to them directly, without incurring\n
      \  any significant performance penalty.  This document defines a new IP\n   option
      type, Router Alert, for this purpose.\n   The Router Alert option has the semantic
      \"routers should examine this\n   packet more closely\".  By including the Router
      Alert option in the IP\n   header of its protocol message, RSVP can cause the
      message to be\n   intercepted while causing little or no performance penalty
      on the\n   forwarding of normal data packets.\n   Routers that support option
      processing in the fast path already\n   demultiplex processing based on the
      option type field.  If all option\n   types are supported in the fast path,
      then the addition of another\n   option type to process is unlikely to impact
      performance.  If some\n   option types are not supported in the fast path, this
      new option type\n   will be unrecognized and cause packets carrying it to be
      kicked out\n   into the slow path, so no change to the fast path is necessary,
      and\n   no performance penalty will be incurred for regular data packets.\n
      \  Routers that do not support option processing in the fast path will\n   cause
      packets carrying this new option to be forwarded through the\n   slow path,
      so no change to the fast path is necessary and no\n   performance penalty will
      be incurred for regular data packets.\n"

      this\n   option shall ignore it.  Routers that recognize this option shall\n
      \  examine packets carrying it more closely (check the IP Protocol\n   field,
      for example) to determine whether or not further processing is\n   necessary.

      other values in the Value field are for further\n   study.\n"

    - "3.0  Impact on Other Protocols\n   For this option to be effective, its use
      must be mandated in\n   protocols that expect routers to perform significant
      processing on\n   packets not directly addressed to them.  Currently such protocols\n
      \  include RSVP [1] and IGMP [2].\n"

    - "4.0 Security Considerations\n   If the Router Alert option is not set and should
      be set, the behavior\n   of the protocol using the Router Alert, e.g., RSVP
      or IGMPv2, will be\n   adversely affected since the protocol relies on the use
      of the Router\n   Alert option.\n   If the Router Alert option is set when it
      should not be set, it is\n   likely that the flow will experience a performance
      penalty, as a\n   packet whose Router Alert option is set will not go through
      the\n   router's fastpath and will be processed in the router more slowly\n
      \  than if the option were not set.\n"
