  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace\
    \ that\n   is managed by SWIFT for usage within messages standardized by SWIFT.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   SWIFT is an industry-owned cooperative supplying secure,\
    \ standardised\n   messaging services and interface software to over 7,500 financial\n\
    \   institutions in 199 countries.  The SWIFT community includes banks,\n   broker/dealers\
    \ and investment managers, as well as their market\n   infrastructures in payments,\
    \ securities, treasury and trade.\n   The goal of this namespace is to ensure\
    \ the stability and uniqueness\n   of the names of various items that are used\
    \ within the messages\n   exchanged between financial institutions.  SWIFT is\
    \ one of the\n   principal standardization bodies for financial messages and services.\n\
    \   This standardization process identifies the structure and meaning of\n   messages\
    \ exchanged for various financial services offered by\n   financial institutions.\
    \  It is essential that names of items (such as\n   the XML schema describing\
    \ the message itself) can be used to identify\n   the resource even years after\
    \ the message has been exchanged.\n   The same resource may exist in multiple\
    \ physical locations, and thus\n   multiple URL's, but only a single URN.\n"

  - "2.  Specification Template\n   Namespace ID:\n      \"swift\"\n   Registration\
    \ Information:\n      Version 1\n      Date: 2001-08-01\n   Declared registrant\
    \ of the namespace:\n          SWIFT s.c.r.l.\n          Avenue Adele 1\n    \
    \      B-1310 La Hulpe\n          Belgium\n   Declaration of syntactic structures:\n\
    \      The structure of the Namespace Specific String is a flat space\n      <URN\
    \ chars> [1] which have no knowable structure outside of the\n      context of\
    \ the SWIFT community internal resolver.  Future changes\n      to the assignment\
    \ methods may allow others to assign sub-spaces of\n      the flat namespace but\
    \ again, this knowledge is only valid\n      internally and should never be inferred\
    \ or relied upon externally.\n   Relevant ancillary Documentation:\n      None\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      Identifiers are assigned by SWIFT\
    \ URN Registration that guarantees\n      uniqueness.  This is simply achieved\
    \ by keeping track of already\n      assigned names and comparing all new proposed\
    \ names to the\n      database ones.  If the name already exists a new one has\
    \ to be\n      proposed.\n   Identifiers persistence considerations:\n      The\
    \ assignment process guarantees that names are not reassigned.\n      In any case\
    \ SWIFT URNs are guaranteed to remain valid for 15\n      years.\n   Process of\
    \ identifiers assignment:\n      Names are granted via SWIFT proprietary registration\
    \ procedures.\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n      SWIFT URNs are resolved\
    \ via URN resolvers run under SWIFT\n      responsibility.\n   Rules for lexical\
    \ equivalence:\n      No special consideration.\n   Conformance with URN syntax:\n\
    \      No special consideration.\n   Validation mechanism:\n      None specified.\n\
    \   Scope:\n      This namespace is reserved to the global financial community.\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Since the URNs in this namespace are opaque there\
    \ are no additional\n   security considerations other than those normally associated\
    \ with the\n   use and resolution of URNs in general.\n   It is noted however\
    \ that attempting to resolve a SWIFT URN through a\n   resolver other than the\
    \ one provided by SWIFT is error prone.  In any\n   case, it is not considered\
    \ authoritative.\n"
