Abstract This document updates RFC 7315, by modifying the extension access  info part of the P Access Network Info header field Augmented Backus  Naur Form (ABNF), and by adding the following 'access info' header field parameter values to the list of 'access info' header field parameter values in the ABNF: 'operator specific GI' and 'utran sai 3gpp'.
The values are defined in the ABNF but are not included in the list.
Introduction [RFC7315] defines the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
[RFC3261] P Access Network Info header field.
The header field syntax contains an 'access info' header field parameter, with a set of pre defined values.
Most pre defined values follow the 'generic param' rule [RFC3261].
However, currently the Augmented Backus Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] in [RFC7315] requires new values to follow the 'gen value' rule [RFC3261], which is more restrictive than 'generic param'.
There is no justification for the restriction, and new values have already been defined following the 'generic param' rule.
The ABNF also defines the following 'access info' header field parameter values: 'operator specific GI' and 'utran sai 3gpp'.
However, the values are not included in the list of 'access info' values.
This document updates Section 5.4 of [RFC7315], by modifying the extension access info part of the P Access Network Info header field ABNF.
As the P Access Network Info header field is mainly used in networks defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), where new values following the 'generic param' rule have been defined [TS.3GPP.24.229], the update is not considered to cause issues with backward compatibility.
This section updates the ABNF defined in Section 5.4 of RFC 7315, as described below:
/ eth location / ci 3gpp2 femto / fiber location / np / gstn location /local time zone / dvb rcs2 node
/ eth location / ci 3gpp2 femto / fiber location / np / gstn location /local time zone / dvb rcs2
The security considerations for the P Access Network Info header field are defined in [RFC7315].
The ABNF update defined in this document does not impact the security considerations.
