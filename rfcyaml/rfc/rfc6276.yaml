  - "1.  Introduction\n   One aspect of network mobility support is the assignment
    of a prefix\n   or prefixes to a mobile router for use on the links in Network\n
    \  Mobility (NEMO).  DHCPv6 prefix delegation (DHCPv6PD) [RFC3633] can\n   be
    used for this configuration task.\n   The model of operation of DHCPv6PD for prefix
    delegation is as\n   follows [RFC3633].  A delegating router is provided IPv6
    prefixes to\n   be delegated to requesting routers.  A requesting router requests\n
    \  prefix(es) from the delegating router.  The delegating router chooses\n   prefix(es)
    for delegation, and responds with prefix(es) to the\n   requesting router.  The
    requesting router is then responsible for the\n   delegated prefix(es).  Note
    that DHCPv6 options for prefix delegation\n   defined in [RFC3633] have been defined
    for general use across\n   routers, and not only for mobile routers running the
    NEMO Basic\n   Support protocol [RFC3963].\n   To use DHCPv6PD as a prefix assignment
    mechanism in mobile networks,\n   when the mobile router is located at home, the
    home agent assumes the\n   role of the delegating router and the mobile router
    assumes the role\n   of the requesting router.  However, when the mobile router
    is away\n   from home, in addition to the roles when the mobile router is located\n
    \  at home, the mobile router also assumes the role of a DHCPv6 relay\n   agent
    co-located with the requesting router function.\n   The DHCPv6PD server running
    at the home agent is provisioned with\n   prefixes to be assigned using any of
    the prefix assignment mechanisms\n   described in the DHCPv6PD specification [RFC3633].\n"

  - "3.  DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation of Mobile Network Prefixes\n   The NEMO Basic Support
    protocol [RFC3963] extends the Mobile IPv6\n   protocol [RFC6275] to enable network
    mobility.  With the NEMO Basic\n   Support protocol, a mobile router uses Mobile
    IPv6 to establish and\n   maintain a session with its home agent and uses bidirectional\n
    \  tunneling between the mobile router and the home agent to provide a\n   path
    through which nodes attached to links in the mobile network can\n   maintain connectivity
    with nodes not in the NEMO.\n   The requirements for Network Mobility [RFC4885]
    include the ability\n   of the mobile router to receive delegated prefixes that
    can then be\n   assigned to links in the mobile network.  DHCPv6PD can be used
    to\n   meet this requirement for prefix delegation.\n   To use DHCPv6PD for mobile
    networks, when the mobile router is\n   located at home, the home agent assumes
    the role of the delegating\n   router and the mobile router assumes the role of
    the requesting\n   router.  However, when the mobile router is away from home,
    in\n   addition to the roles when the mobile router is located at home, the\n
    \  mobile router also assumes the role of a DHCPv6 relay agent\n   co-located
    with the requesting router function.\n   When the mobile router is not at home,
    the home agent and the mobile\n   router exchange DHCPv6PD protocol messages as
    specified in [RFC6275].\n   This means that the messages sent by the mobile router
    MUST include\n   the Home Address destination option and messages sent by the
    home\n   agent MUST make use of a Routing Header type 2.  See Figure 1 for the\n
    \  deployment topologies when the MR is at home and when it is visiting\n   a
    foreign network.\n                  ------                ------\n                  |

    provisioned with prefixes to be assigned using\n   any of the prefix assignment
    mechanisms described in the DHCPv6PD\n   specifications.  Other updates to the
    home agent data structures\n   required as a side effect of prefix delegation
    are specified by the\n   particular network mobility protocol.  For example, in
    the case of\n   NEMO Basic Network Mobility Support [RFC3963], the HA would add
    an\n   entry in its binding cache registering the delegated prefix to the\n   mobile
    router to which the prefix was delegated.\n"

    - "3.1.  Exchanging DHCPv6 Messages When the Mobile Router Is Not at Home\n   The
      case when the mobile router is away from home is described in\n   this section.
      \ Section 3.2 describes the protocol operation for the\n   case when the mobile
      router is attached to its home link.\n   The mobile router MUST register at
      the home agent (i.e., by sending a\n   Binding Update to the home agent) before
      initiating a DHCPv6 message\n   exchange for prefix delegation.  The mobile
      router MUST use implicit\n   BU signaling, since the mobile router may not have
      yet requested any\n   prefixes.\n   If the mobile router does not have any active
      delegated prefixes\n   (with unexpired leases), the mobile router MUST initiate
      a DHCPv6\n   message exchange with a DHCPv6 Solicit message as described in\n
      \  Section 17 of [RFC3315] and Section 11.1 of [RFC3633].  The\n   delegating
      router at the home agent responds with an Advertise\n   message.  Then, the
      mobile router MUST request a set of prefixes by\n   sending a Request message.
      \ The delegating router includes the\n   delegated prefixes in a Reply message.
      \ Note that in this case, the\n   mobile router has previously sent a Binding
      Update to the home agent\n   without knowing yet the set of prefixes that it
      can use as mobile\n   network prefixes.  The home agent, upon reception of the
      implicit\n   Binding Update from the mobile router, MUST select (in case this
      was\n   not pre-configured already) the prefixes that would then be delegated\n
      \  to the mobile router via DHCPv6PD.  The home agent, once the DHCPv6\n   signaling
      has been completed, MUST add an entry in its binding cache\n   including the
      delegated prefixes.\n   In case the mobile router has one or more active delegated
      prefixes\n   -- for example, as if the mobile router reboots or the mobile network\n
      \  prefix(es) currently used by the mobile router is about to expire --\n   the
      mobile router MUST initiate a DHCPv6 message exchange with a\n   DHCPv6 Rebind
      message as described in Section 18.1.2 of [RFC3315] and\n   Section 12.1 of
      [RFC3633].\n   A DHPCv6 relay agent function [RFC3315] MUST be used at the mobile\n
      \  router.  This relay agent function is co-located in the mobile router\n   with
      the DHCPv6 client function (see Figure 2).  The DHCPv6 signaling\n   between
      the mobile router and the home agent is exchanged between the\n   DHCPv6 relay
      agent in the mobile router and the DHCPv6 server on the\n   home agent.  DHCPv6
      messages from the mobile router to the home agent\n   are unicast packets sent
      from the unicast home address of the mobile\n   router to the global unicast
      address of the home agent, and therefore\n   the Home Address destination option
      MUST be used.  DHCPv6 replies\n   from the home agent to the mobile router MUST
      be sent using the\n   Routing Header type 2, as specified in [RFC6275].  The
      DHCPv6 client\n   in the mobile router MUST hand any outbound DHCPv6 messages
      to the\n   co-located relay agent.  Responses from the DHCPv6 server are\n   delivered
      to the relay agent function in the mobile router, which\n   MUST extract the
      encapsulated message and deliver it to the DHCPv6\n   client in the mobile router.\n

      - "3.1.1.  Relay Agent Configuration\n   The use of the relay agent function
        in the mobile router allows the\n   mobile router to unicast DHCPv6 messages
        to the DHCPv6 server.  The\n   relay agent MUST be configured with the address
        of the DHCPv6 server.\n   For the purposes of this specification, the relay
        agent assumes that\n   the home agent for the mobile router hosts the DHCPv6
        server.\n   Therefore, the mobile router MUST configure the DHCPv6 relay agent
        to\n   forward DHCPv6 messages to the home agent.\n   The DHCPv6 specification
        supports in certain scenarios the use of\n   unicast between the client and
        the server.  However, its use presents\n   some difficulties, as the client
        has to first receive a Server\n   Unicast option (Section 22.12 of [RFC3315])
        from the server, which\n   means that a Solicit/Advertise message exchange
        is required in\n   advance.  That signaling exchange would require the presence
        of a\n   relay agent on the mobile router, and therefore little gain would
        be\n   achieved in this case from the use of the Server Unicast option.\n"

      exchange\n   (i.e., sending a Solicit message) in which the mobile router requests\n
      \  delegated prefix(es).  If the home agent does not respond or responds\n   but
      does not delegate any prefix(es) in its response, the mobile\n   router assumes
      that the home agent does not provide DHCPv6PD service.\n   The mobile router
      continues to query all candidate home agents until\n   it finds one that provides
      DHCPv6PD.  Note that in this particular\n   case and if the mobile router is
      away from home, the mobile router\n   has to have already performed a Mobile
      IPv6 registration with the\n   home agent it queries.\n   Querying a home agent
      to determine if it provides DHCPv6PD requires\n   different operational variables
      than those recommended by the DHCPv6\n   specification.  [RFC3315] recommends
      that under normal circumstances,\n   a host will continue to send DHCPv6 Solicit
      messages until it\n   receives a response (see Section 17 of [RFC3315]), i.e.,
      the Maximum\n   Retransmission Duration (MRD) and Maximum Retransmission Count
      (MRC)\n   are both set to zero.  However, a home agent may not respond to the\n
      \  Solicit messages from the mobile router because the home agent does\n   not
      support DHCPv6 prefix delegation.  Therefore, when querying a\n   home agent
      to determine if the home agent provides DHCPv6PD service,\n   it is RECOMMENDED
      that MRD and MRC be set to non-zero values so that\n   the mobile router discontinues
      sending Solicit messages to the home\n   agent after sending 6 Solicit messages,
      and conclude that the home\n   agent will not provide DHCPv6PD service.  Sending
      6 queries provides\n   enough reliability for scenarios in which the wireless
      connectivity\n   is lost for a short period after sending the first Binding
      Update\n   message.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that the mobile router uses a sequential
      probing of\n   the home agents for DHCPv6PD service.\n"

      can be combined with the Rapid\n   Commit option [RFC3315] to provide DHCPv6
      prefix delegation with a\n   two-message exchange between the mobile router
      and the DHCPv6PD\n   delegating router.\n"

      mobile router and the home\n   agent MAY also be used for other DHCPv6 functions
      in addition to\n   DHCPv6PD.  For example, the home agent MAY assign global
      addresses to\n   the mobile router and MAY pass other configuration information
      such\n   as a list of available DNS recursive name servers [RFC3646] to the\n
      \  mobile router using the same DHCPv6 messages as used for DHCPv6PD.\n   The
      home agent MAY act as a DHCPv6 relay agent for mobile nodes while\n   it acts
      as a delegating router for mobile routers.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes the use of DHCPv6 for
    prefix delegation in\n   mobile networks.  In addition to the security considerations
    for\n   DHCPv6 described in the \"Security Considerations\" section of the\n   DHCPv6
    base specification [RFC3315] and the \"Security Considerations\"\n   of the DHCPv6
    Prefix Delegation specification [RFC3633], there are\n   two aspects that need
    to be considered.\n   First, the NEMO Basic Support specification requires the
    home agent\n   to prevent a mobile router from claiming mobile network prefixes\n
    \  belonging to another mobile router.  Upon reception of an implicit\n   Binding
    Update from a mobile router, the home agent MUST only add\n   prefixes into the
    mobile router's Binding Cache Entry if the mobile\n   router has a valid DHCPv6
    Prefix Delegation lease for said prefixes.\n   If the mobile router does not have
    a valid DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation\n   lease, the home agent MUST NOT add any prefixes
    into the mobile\n   router's Binding Cache Entry.  Upon the mobile router obtaining
    a\n   valid DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation lease for a given set of prefixes, the\n
    \  home agent MUST add these prefixes to the mobile router's Binding\n   Cache
    Entry.  This avoids the home agent forwarding traffic addressed\n   to prefixes
    that have not been yet delegated to the mobile router.\n   The use of DHCPv6,
    as described in this document, requires message\n   integrity protection and source
    authentication.  When the mobile\n   router is at home, normal DHCPv6 operation
    is used between the mobile\n   router and the home agent and therefore this specification
    does not\n   add any new security issue.  While the mobile router is away from\n
    \  home, the IPsec security mechanism mandated by Mobile IPv6 [RFC3776]\n   MUST
    be used to secure the DHCPv6 signaling.  In the following, we\n   describe the
    Security Policy Database (SPD) and Security Association\n   Database (SAD) entries
    necessary to protect the DHCPv6 signaling.  We\n   use the same format used by
    [RFC4877].  The SPD and SAD entries are\n   only example configurations.  A particular
    mobile router\n   implementation and a home agent implementation could configure\n
    \  different SPD and SAD entries as long as they provide the required\n   security
    of the DHCPv6 signaling messages.\n   For the examples described in this document,
    a mobile router with\n   home address \"home_address_1\", and a home agent with
    address\n   \"home_agent_1\" are assumed.  If the home address of the mobile router\n
    \  changes, the SPD and SAD entries need to be re-created or updated for\n   the
    new home address.\n      mobile router SPD-S:\n        - IF local_address = home_address_1
    &\n             remote_address = home_agent_1 & proto = UDP &\n             local_port
    = any & remote_port = DHCP\n          Then use SA1 (OUT) and SA2 (IN)\n      mobile
    router SAD:\n        - SA1(OUT, spi_a, home_agent_1, ESP, TRANSPORT):\n              local_address
    = home_address_1 &\n              remote_address = home_agent_1 &\n              proto
    = UDP & remote_port = DHCP\n        - SA2(IN, spi_b, home_address_1, ESP, TRANSPORT):\n
    \             local_address = home_agent_1 &\n              remote_address = home_address_1
    &\n              proto = UDP & local_port = DHCP\n      home agent SPD-S:\n        -
    IF local_address = home_agent_1 &\n             remote_address = homa_address_1
    & proto = UDP &\n             local_port = DHCP & remote_port = any\n          Then
    use SA2 (OUT) and SA1 (IN)\n      home agent SAD:\n        - SA2(OUT, spi_b, home_address_1,
    ESP, TRANSPORT):\n              local_address = home_agent_1 &\n              remote_address
    = home_address_1 &\n              proto = UDP & local_port = DHCP\n        - SA1(IN,
    spi_a, home_agent_1, ESP, TRANSPORT):\n              local_address = home_address_1
    &\n              remote_address = home_agent_1 &\n              proto = UDP &
    remote_port = DHCP\n"
