  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document alters the specification defined in RFC 2535.  Based\
    \ on\n   implementation experience, the Authenticated Data (AD) bit in the DNS\n\
    \   header is not useful.  This document redefines the AD bit such that\n   it\
    \ is only set if all answers or records proving that no answers\n   exist in the\
    \ response has been cryptographically verified or\n   otherwise meets the server's\
    \ local security policy.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Familiarity with the DNS system [RFC1035] and DNS security\
    \ extensions\n   [RFC2535] is helpful but not necessary.\n   As specified in RFC\
    \ 2535 (section 6.1), the AD (Authenticated Data)\n   bit indicates in a response\
    \ that all data included in the answer and\n   authority sections of the response\
    \ have been authenticated by the\n   server according to the policies of that\
    \ server.  This is not\n   especially useful in practice, since a conformant server\
    \ SHOULD never\n   reply with data that failed its security policy.\n   This document\
    \ redefines the AD bit such that it is only set if all\n   data in the response\
    \ has been cryptographically verified or otherwise\n   meets the server's local\
    \ security policy.  Thus, neither a response\n   containing properly delegated\
    \ insecure data, nor a server configured\n   without DNSSEC keys, will have the\
    \ AD set.  As before, data that\n   failed to verify will not be returned.  An\
    \ application running on a\n   host that has a trust relationship with the server\
    \ performing the\n   recursive query can now use the value of the AD bit to determine\n\
    \   whether the data is secure.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Motivation\n   A full DNSSEC capable resolver called directly from an application\n\
    \   can return to the application the security status of the RRsets in\n   the\
    \ answer.  However, most applications use a limited stub resolver\n   that relies\
    \ on an external recursive name server which incorporates a\n   full resolver.\
    \  The recursive nameserver can use the AD bit in a\n   response to indicate the\
    \ security status of the data in the answer,\n   and the local resolver can pass\
    \ this information to the application.\n   The application in this context can\
    \ be either a human using a DNS\n   tool or a software application.\n   The AD\
    \ bit SHOULD be used by the local resolver if and only if it has\n   been explicitly\
    \ configured to trust the remote resolver.  The AD bit\n   SHOULD be ignored when\
    \ the recursive name server is not trusted.\n   An alternate solution would be\
    \ to embed a full DNSSEC resolver into\n   every application, but this has several\
    \ disadvantages.\n   -  DNSSEC validation is both CPU and network intensive, and\
    \ caching\n      SHOULD be used whenever possible.\n   -  DNSSEC requires non-trivial\
    \ configuration - the root key must be\n      configured, as well as keys for\
    \ any \"islands of security\" that\n      will exist until DNSSEC is fully deployed.\
    \  The number of\n      configuration points should be minimized.\n"

    , \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\n   NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", in this document are to be\
    \ interpreted as\n   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"

  contents:
  - "1.3.  Updated documents and sections\n   The definition of the AD bit in RFC\
    \ 2535, Section 6.1, is changed.\n"
- title: 2.  Setting of AD bit
  contents:
  - "2.  Setting of AD bit\n   The presence of the CD (Checking Disabled) bit in a\
    \ query does not\n   affect the setting of the AD bit in the response.  If the\
    \ CD bit is\n   set, the server will not perform checking, but SHOULD still set\
    \ the\n   AD bit if the data has already been cryptographically verified or\n\
    \   complies with local policy.  The AD bit MUST only be set if DNSSEC\n   records\
    \ have been requested via the DO bit [RFC3225] and relevant SIG\n   records are\
    \ returned.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Setting of AD bit by recursive servers
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Setting of AD bit by recursive servers\n   Section 6.1 of RFC 2535 says:\n\
    \   \"The AD bit MUST NOT be set on a response unless all of the RRs in\n   the\
    \ answer and authority sections of the response are either\n   Authenticated or\
    \ Insecure.\"\n   The replacement text reads:\n   \"The AD bit MUST NOT be set\
    \ on a response unless all of the RRsets in\n   the answer and authority sections\
    \ of the response are Authenticated.\"\n   \"The AD bit SHOULD be set if and only\
    \ if all RRs in the answer\n   section and any relevant negative response RRs\
    \ in the authority\n   section are Authenticated.\"\n   A recursive DNS server\
    \ following this modified specification will\n   only set the AD bit when it has\
    \ cryptographically verified the data\n   in the answer.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Setting of AD bit by authoritative servers
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Setting of AD bit by authoritative servers\n   A primary server for a secure\
    \ zone MAY have the policy of treating\n   authoritative secure zones as Authenticated.\
    \  Secondary servers MAY\n   have the same policy, but SHOULD NOT consider zone\
    \ data Authenticated\n   unless the zone was transferred securely and/or the data\
    \ was\n   verified.  An authoritative server MUST only set the AD bit for\n  \
    \ authoritative answers from a secure zone if it has been explicitly\n   configured\
    \ to do so.  The default for this behavior SHOULD be off.\n   Note that having\
    \ the AD bit clear on an authoritative answer is\n   normal and expected behavior.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Justification for setting AD bit w/o verifying data
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Justification for setting AD bit w/o verifying data\n   The setting of\
    \ the AD bit by authoritative servers affects only the\n   small set of resolvers\
    \ that are configured to directly query and\n   trust authoritative servers. \
    \ This only affects servers that function\n   as both recursive and authoritative.\
    \  Iterative resolvers SHOULD\n   ignore the AD bit.\n   The cost of verifying\
    \ all signatures on load by an authoritative\n   server can be high and increases\
    \ the delay before it can begin\n   answering queries.  Verifying signatures at\
    \ query time is also\n   expensive and could lead to resolvers timing out on many\
    \ queries\n   after the server reloads zones.\n   Organizations requiring that\
    \ all DNS responses contain\n   cryptographically verified data will need to separate\
    \ the\n   authoritative name server and signature verification functions, since\n\
    \   name servers are not required to validate signatures of data for\n   which\
    \ they are authoritative.\n"
- title: 3.  Interpretation of the AD bit
  contents:
  - "3.  Interpretation of the AD bit\n   A response containing data marked Insecure\
    \ in the answer or authority\n   section MUST never have the AD bit set.  In this\
    \ case, the resolver\n   SHOULD treat the data as Insecure whether or not SIG\
    \ records are\n   present.\n   A resolver MUST NOT blindly trust the AD bit unless\
    \ it communicates\n   with a recursive nameserver over a secure transport mechanism\
    \ or\n   using a message authentication such as TSIG [RFC2845] or SIG(0)\n   [RFC2931]\
    \ and is explicitly configured to trust this recursive name\n   server.\n"
- title: 4.  Applicability statement
  contents:
  - "4.  Applicability statement\n   The AD bit is intended to allow the transmission\
    \ of the indication\n   that a resolver has verified the DNSSEC signatures accompanying\
    \ the\n   records in the Answer and Authority section.  The AD bit MUST only be\n\
    \   trusted when the end consumer of the DNS data has confidence that the\n  \
    \ intermediary resolver setting the AD bit is trustworthy.  This can\n   only\
    \ be accomplished via an out of band mechanism such as:\n   -  Fiat: An organization\
    \ that can dictate whether it is OK to trust\n      certain DNS servers.\n   -\
    \  Personal: Because of a personal relationship or the reputation of\n      a\
    \ recursive nameserver operator, a DNS consumer can decide to\n      trust that\
    \ recursive nameserver.\n   -  Knowledge: If a recursive nameserver operator posts\
    \ the configured\n      policy of a recursive nameserver, a consumer can decide\
    \ that\n      recursive nameserver is trustworthy.\n   In the absence of one or\
    \ more of these factors AD bit from a\n   recursive name server SHOULD NOT be\
    \ trusted.  For example, home users\n   frequently depend on their ISP to provide\
    \ recursive DNS service; it\n   is not advisable to trust these recursive nameservers.\
    \  A\n   roaming/traveling host SHOULD not use recursive DNS servers offered\n\
    \   by DHCP when looking up information where security status matters.\n   In\
    \ the latter two cases, the end consumer must also completely trust\n   the path\
    \ to the trusted recursive name servers, or a secure transport\n   must be employed\
    \ to protect the traffic.\n   When faced with a situation where there are no satisfactory\
    \ recursive\n   nameservers available, running one locally is RECOMMENDED.  This\
    \ has\n   the advantage that it can be trusted, and the AD bit can still be\n\
    \   used to allow applications to use stub resolvers.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document redefines a bit in the DNS header.\
    \  If a resolver\n   trusts the value of the AD bit, it must be sure that the\
    \ responder is\n   using the updated definition, which is any DNS server/resolver\n\
    \   supporting the DO bit [RFC3225].\n   Authoritative servers can be explicitly\
    \ configured to set the AD bit\n   on answers without doing cryptographic checks.\
    \  This behavior MUST be\n   off by default.  The only affected resolvers are\
    \ those that directly\n   query and trust the authoritative server, and this functionality\n\
    \   SHOULD only be used on servers that act both as authoritative and\n   recursive\
    \ name servers.\n   Resolvers (full or stub) that blindly trust the AD bit without\n\
    \   knowing the security policy of the server generating the answer can\n   not\
    \ be considered security aware.\n   A resolver MUST NOT blindly trust the AD bit\
    \ unless it communicates\n   such as IPsec, or using message authentication such\
    \ as TSIG [RFC2845]\n   or SIG(0) [RFC2931].  In addition, the resolver must have\
    \ been\n   explicitly configured to trust this recursive name server.\n"
