  - "1. Introduction\n   As the worldwide academic computer network grows and expands\
    \ far\n   beyond its previous confines, so the resources and services available\n\
    \   on the network evolve and multiply at a dizzying rate. The typical\n   user\
    \ is hardpressed to keep up with this explosive growth.\n   Fortunately, a number\
    \ of tools are available to facilitate the task\n   of locating and retrieving\
    \ network resources, so that users anywhere\n   can utilize texts, data, software\
    \ and information for public access.\n   Facilities to explore public domain software\
    \ repositories, to consult\n   mailing list archives and databases, to retrieve\
    \ directory\n   information and to participate in global group discussions are\
    \ now\n   available to all.\n   The key to exploiting these resources is a server,\
    \ special software\n   on a computer somewhere in the network which accepts requests\
    \ (or\n   queries or commands) and sends a response automatically. The\n   requestor\
    \ does not have to be working on the same computer (or even\n   in the same part\
    \ of the world) in order to use the server. Many\n   servers accept requests via\
    \ electronic mail, so that often the\n   requestor needs not even be on the same\
    \ computer network as the\n   server. In many cases, servers are interconnected\
    \ so that once you\n   have established contact with one server, you can easily\
    \ communicate\n   with other servers as well.\n   Today, many users have powerful\
    \ computers on the desktop, with\n   advanced graphical, audio and storage capabilities,\
    \ which are\n   connected to the network. This fact has given rise to what is\
    \ known\n   as the client-server model. Users can have special software on their\n\
    \   local computer called a client which can utilize the capabilities of\n   that\
    \ computer and can also communicate with a server on the network.\n   These clients\
    \ provide an easy-to-use, intuitive user interface, allow\n   use of pointing\
    \ devices such as a mouse, and exploit other local\n   features. The client sends\
    \ the user's requests to a server using a\n   standardized format (called a protocol)\
    \ and the server sends its\n   response in a condensed format which the client\
    \ displays to the user\n   in a more readable way.\n   Several of the tools described\
    \ herein have several different\n   functions.  However they could be classified\
    \ in functional areas\n   according to their main purpose. Sections two and three\
    \ cover two\n   services, Gopher and World-Wide Web, which use the client-server\n\
    \   model to explore the network providing a means of moving through a\n   wide\
    \ range of network sources and resources in a uniform and\n   intuitive way. \
    \ A tool for searching in a wide range of different\n   databases located throughout\
    \ the network, WAIS, is documented in\n   section four. The problem of knowing\
    \ where to find network resources\n   (files and programs) is addressed in section\
    \ five, which deals with\n   archie. Three tools for finding people, computers\
    \ and their network\n   addresses, WHOIS, X.500 and Netfind, are discussed in\
    \ sections six,\n   seven and eight. While just about all of these network tools\
    \ can be\n   used to get files of one sort or another, there are a few servers\n\
    \   available for getting files easily and efficiently from various\n   repositories\
    \ in the network. Two of these servers, TRICKLE and\n   BITFTP, are covered in\
    \ sections nine and ten. Sections eleven and\n   twelve deal with what is perhaps\
    \ the most popular of all the network\n   resources, discussion groups on every\
    \ imaginable topic. The two tools\n   discussed there are LISTSERV and Netnews\
    \ (Usenet). Section thirteen\n   gives brief descriptions and pointers for a number\
    \ of tools which\n   were not mainstream enough to get a full description. Some\
    \ are still\n   in the developmental stage (Prospero), some are relatively unknown\n\
    \   outside a particular network (ASTRA and Netserv from EARN/Bitnet and\n   Mailbase\
    \ from JANET) and some are meant for chatting rather than work\n   (Relay and\
    \ IRC).\n   The purpose of this guide is to supply the basic information that\n\
    \   anyone on the network needs to try out and begin using these tools. A\n  \
    \ basic knowledge of networking terminology has been assumed, as well\n   as familiarity\
    \ with the basic tools of networking: electronic mail\n   (often referred to as\
    \ e-mail or simply mail throughout this guide)\n   and, for those connected to\
    \ the Internet, FTP (file transfer\n   protocol) and Telnet (remote login). It\
    \ is beyond the scope of this\n   guide to describe these basic tools. The example\
    \ in the BITFTP\n   section of this guide shows how one can use BITFTP to get\
    \ guides to\n   these tools over the network.\n"

  - "2.1. What is Gopher\n   The Internet Gopher, or simply Gopher, is a distributed\
    \ document\n   delivery service. It allows users to explore, search and retrieve\n\
    \   information residing on different locations in a seamless fashion.\n   When\
    \ browsing it, the information appears to the user as a series of\n   nested menus.\
    \ This kind of menu structure resembles the organization\n   of a directory with\
    \ many subdirectories and files. The subdirectories\n   and the files may be located\
    \ either on the local server site or on\n   remote sites served by other Gopher\
    \ servers. From the user point of\n   view, all information items presented on\

    \      In the example above, any item can be selected by typing its line\n   \
    \   number or by moving the cursor (-->) next to it.\n      An item could be:\n\
    \         * a subdirectory\n         * a text file\n         * a binary file\n\
    \         * a sound file\n         * an image file\n         * a phone book (directory\
    \ information)\n         * an index-search\n         * a Telnet session\n    \
    \  Items are displayed with an identifying symbol next to them. In\n      the\
    \ example above, \"<?>\" means a full text index-search, \"/\" means\n      a\
    \ subdirectory, \"<Picture>\" means an image file and no symbol\n      means a\
    \ text file.\n      Some Gopher clients are not able to handle certain file types\n\
    \      (e.g., sound files). Some clients display only files of types they\n  \
    \    can handle or files they suppose you are interested in. Others\n      display\
    \ all types of files.\n      Most Gopher clients allow you to create, view and\
    \ select\n      bookmarks. A bookmark keeps track of the exact location of a\n\
    \      Gopher item, regardless of where it resides. It is useful when you\n  \
    \    often need to reach a file or a service located far from the\n      top-level\
    \ directory. A collection of bookmarks is like a\n      customized Gopher menu.\n\
    \      Some capabilities of a local Gopher client are bound to the\n      capabilities\
    \ of your own computer. In fact, for sound files, image\n      files and Telnet\
    \ sessions, the Gopher client looks for the\n      appropriate software on your\
    \ computer and passes control to it to\n      perform the requested task. When\
    \ the task is completed, control is\n      returned to the Gopher client.\n  \
    \    At any time, it is possible to terminate the session (quit\n      command),\
    \ to cancel the current processing or to get the on-line\n      help (help command).\n\
    \      An item is processed according to its type:\n      a subdirectory\n   \
    \      its contents are displayed. To go up one level, use the up\n         command.\n\
    \      a text file\n         the file is displayed. Then you can browse it, search\
    \ for a\n         particular string, print it on a local printer or copy (save)\n\
    \         it onto your local disk space in a user-specified file (the\n      \
    \   last 2 functions may not be available to you).\n      a binary file\n    \
    \     the remote file is simply copied onto your local disk space in\n       \
    \  a user-specified file. Binary files are binhexed Macintosh\n         files,\
    \ archives (.zip, .tar,...), compressed files, programs,\n         etc.\n    \
    \  a sound file\n         the remote file is played through your local audio device\
    \ if it\n         exists, as well as the appropriate utility. Only one sound file\n\
    \         can be active at a time; you will be warned if you try to play\n   \
    \      a sound before a previous one is done.\n      an image file\n         the\
    \ remote file is displayed on your computer screen if an\n         image viewer\

    \ a search string to look up people\n         information through the selected\
    \ phone book. Since different\n         institutions have different directory\
    \ services, the queries are\n         not performed in the same fashion.\n   \
    \   an index-search\n         you are prompted for a search string which may be\
    \ one or more\n         words, plus the special operators and, or, and not. The\
    \ search\n         is case-insensitive. Usually, an index is created to help users\n\
    \         locate the information in a set of documents quickly. E.g.:\n      \
    \        terminal and setting or tset\n         will find all documents which\
    \ contain both the words terminal\n         and setting, or the word tset. or\
    \ is nonexclusive so the\n         documents may contain all of the words.\n \
    \        The result of the index-search looks like any Gopher menu, but\n    \
    \     each menu item is a file that contains the specified search\n         string.\n\
    \      a Telnet session\n         Telnet sessions are normally text-based information\

  contents:
  - "3.1. What is World-Wide Web\n   World-Wide Web (also called WWW or W3) is an\
    \ information system based\n   on hypertext, which offers a means of moving from\
    \ document to\n   document (usually called to navigate) within a network of\n\
    \   information.\n   Hypertext documents are linked to each other through a selected\
    \ set\n   of words. For example, when a new word, or a new concept, is\n   introduced\
    \ in a text, hypertext makes it possible to point to another\n   document which\
    \ gives more details about it. The reader can open the\n   second document by\
    \ selecting the unknown word or concept and the\n   relevant section is displayed.\
    \ The second document may also contain\n   links to further details. The reader\
    \ need not know where the\n   referenced document is, and there is no need to\
    \ type a command to\n   display it, or to browse it to find the right paragraph.\n\
    \   Cross-references may be defined in the same document. A collection of\n  \
    \ documents is a database.\n   If you were reading this document on a hypertext\
    \ system, instead of\n   this all too short explanation about hypertext, you would\
    \ have a\n   selectable pointer to a complete hypertext information web with\n\
    \   examples and more pointers to other definitions.\n   For instance, in the\
    \ first document you might read:\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \   The  WorldWideWeb (W3)  is a  wide-area \"hypermedia\"  information\n   retrieval\
    \ initiative aiming  to give universal access  to a large\n   universe of documents.\n\
    \   -----------------------------------------------------------------\n   Selecting\
    \ hypermedia will display the following explanation for you:\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \                          WHAT IS HYPERTEXT\n   Hypertext is text which is not\
    \ constrained to be linear.\n   Hypertext is text which contains \"links\" to\
    \ other texts. The term\n   was coined by \"Ted Nelson\" around 1965 (see \"History\"\
    ).\n   HyperMedia is a term used  for hypertext which is not constrained\n   to\
    \  be text:  it can  include  graphics, video  and \"sound\",  for\n   example.\
    \ Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \   Then you can learn more about links and Nelson. Indeed, the links in\n   WWW\
    \ are not confined to text only, so the term hypermedia is more\n   accurate.\
    \  For example, the link to Nelson might point to a file\n   containing a picture\
    \ of Ted Nelson. The picture would be displayed on\n   your screen if you have\
    \ a suitable configuration.\n   Also, special documents (indexes) in the WWW information\
    \ space can be\n   search for given keyword(s). The result is a document which\
    \ contains\n   links to the documents found.\n   World-Wide Web uses hypertext\
    \ over the network: the linked documents\n   may be located at various sites.\
    \ WWW can handle different text\n   formats and various information organizations.\
    \ WWW also provides\n   access to many of the other tools described in this guide.\n"

    \   you may use a client at a remote site. Thus, an easy way to start\n   with\
    \ WWW is to access a remote client.\n   3.3.1. Local clients\n      Usage of a\
    \ local client is encouraged since it provides better\n      performance and better\
    \ response time than a remote client.\n      Public domain clients for accessing\

- title: 4.1. What is WAIS
  contents:
  - "4.1. What is WAIS\n   WAIS, Wide Area Information Server,  is a distributed information\n\
    \   retrieval system. It helps users search databases over networks using\n  \
    \ an easy-to-use interface. The databases (called sources) are mostly\n   collections\
    \ of text-based documents, but they may also contain sound,\n   pictures or video\
    \ as well. Databases on topics ranging from\n   Agriculture to Social Science\
    \ can be searched with WAIS.\n   The databases may be organized in different ways,\
    \ using various\n   database systems, but the user isn't required to learn the\
    \ query\n   languages of the different databases. WAIS uses natural language\n\
    \   queries to find relevant documents. The result of the query is a set\n   of\
    \ documents which contain the words of the query: no semantic\n   information\
    \ is extracted from the query.\n"
- title: 4.2. Who can use WAIS
  contents:
  - "4.2. Who can use WAIS\n   WAIS uses the client-server model to provide access\
    \ to databases. You\n   must be on the international TCP/IP network (the Internet)\
    \ in order\n   to use a client on your computer to access WAIS.\n   If you have\
    \ e-mail access only, or if you are not on the Internet you\n   can still exploit\
    \ some of the potential of WAIS. An e-mail interface\n   is available at the address:\
    \ waismail@quake.think.com which gives\n   e-mail access to WAIS databases (see\
    \ E-mail access section under\n   Using WAIS below).\n"
- title: 4.3. How to get to WAIS
  contents:
  - "4.3. How to get to WAIS\n   There are many WAIS servers throughout the network.\
    \ A\n   directory-of-servers database is available at several sites. You can\n\
    \   address a query to it, e.g., to find out what databases are available\n  \
    \ on a particular subject. This database is also available via\n   anonymous FTP\
    \ from Think.com in the directory /wais as file\n   wais-sources.tar.Z.\n   If\
    \ you do not have access to a WAIS client, (at least) two\n   demonstration sites\
    \ are available to allow you to get acquainted with\n   WAIS. You can telnet to:\n\

    \ and\n   for specific environments (GNU Emacs, X-Windows, Openlook, Sunview,\n\
    \   NeXT, and MS-Windows). See the list of freely available client\n   software\
    \ in Appendix A.\n   The client interface differs slightly on different platforms.\n\
    \   However, the queries are performed in the same way, whatever the\n   interface.\n\
    \   * Step 1: The user selects a set of databases to be searched from\n     among\
    \ the available databases.\n   * Step 2: The user formulates a query by giving\
    \ keywords to be\n     searched for.\n   * Step 3: When the query is run, WAIS\
    \ asks for information from each\n     selected database.\n   * Step 4: Headlines\
    \ of documents satisfying the query are displayed.\n     The selected documents\
    \ contain the requested words and phrases.\n     Selected documents are ranked\
    \ according to the number of matches.\n   * Step 5: To retrieve a document, the\
    \ user simply selects it from the\n     resulting list.\n   * Step 6: If the response\
    \ is incomplete, the user can state the\n     question differently or feed back\
    \ to the system any one or more of\n     the selected documents he finds relevant.\n\
    \   * Step 7: When the search is run again, the results will be updated\n    \

- title: 5.1. What is ARCHIE
  contents:
  - "5.1. What is ARCHIE\n   Archie is an information system. It offers an electronic\
    \ directory\n   service for locating information in the international TCP/IP network\n\
    \   (the Internet).\n   The best known use of archie is for scanning a database\
    \ of the\n   contents of more than 1000 anonymous FTP sites around the world.\n\
    \   Currently, this database contains more than 2,100,000 file names from\n  \
    \ anonymous FTP sites. This database is known as the archie database.\n   The\
    \ files made available at anonymous FTP sites are software packages\n   for various\
    \ systems (Windows, MS-DOS, Macintosh, Unix, etc.),\n   utilities, information\
    \ or documentation files, mailing list or Usenet\n   group discussion archives.\
    \ At most FTP sites, the resources are\n   organized hierarchically in directories\
    \ and subdirectories. The\n   database tracks both the directory path and the\
    \ file names.\n   The archie database is automatically updated, thereby ensuring\
    \ that\n   the information is accurate. Using this database, users can easily\n\
    \   find the the location of files they need without logging onto several\n  \
    \ machines.\n"
- title: 5.2. Who can use ARCHIE
  contents:
  - "5.2. Who can use ARCHIE\n   Users on any network can access the archie database\
    \ by electronic\n   mail.  Other means of access are available to users on the\
    \ Internet\n   (see the section Using ARCHIE below for details).\n   You are requested\
    \ to respect a few basic rules when you request\n   information from an archie\
    \ server:\n      * avoid connecting during working hours; most of the archie\n\
    \      servers are\n        not dedicated machines, they have local functions\
    \ as well.\n      * make your queries as specific as possible; the response will\
    \ be\n        quicker and shorter.\n      * user interfaces installed on your\
    \ computer contribute to reduce\n      the\n        load on the server sites,\
    \ please use them.\n      * use the archie server closest to you and, in particularly,\
    \ don't\n        overload the transatlantic lines.\n"

- title: 5.4. Using ARCHIE
  contents:
  - "5.4. Using ARCHIE\n   The format of the parameters is given at the end of this\
    \ section.\n   Angle brackets (<>) indicate an optional parameter; a vertical\
    \ bar\n   (|) indicates a choice of parameters.\n   Note: A new version of the\
    \ archie server (3.0) is now available. Some\n   of the commands for interactive\
    \ access and the e-mail interface are\n   slightly different from previous versions\
    \ of the server (2.11 and\n   before). Command formats marked with a (+) are valid\
    \ in version 3.0\n   only, those marked with a (*) are acceptable only in previous\n\
    \   versions.  To find out which version is installed at the server you\n   wish\
    \ to use, issue the version command.\n   5.4.1. Using a local client:\n      Usage\
    \ of these clients is encouraged since they provide quick and\n      easy non-interactive\
    \ access to the archie servers, and thus,\n      better performance of the servers\
    \ and better response time for the\n      user.\n      Public domain clients for\
    \ accessing archie servers are available\n      for: Macintosh, MS-DOS, OS/2,\
    \ VMS, NeXT, Unix and X-Windows. The\n      clients are available for anonymous\
    \ FTP from the archie sites in\n      the directories /pub/archie/clients or /archie/clients.\
    \ All these\n      platforms support a simple command line client. In addition,\
    \ a\n      graphical interface (called xarchie) is available for X-Windows.\n\
    \      5.4.1.1. Archie client command and parameters\n      When using a graphical\
    \ interface, you access the archie functions\n      by pressing mousse buttons.\
    \ The results are displayed with\n      selectable fields for further explorations.\n\
    \      The basic archie client is a command with parameters that you\n      enter\
    \ on your local machine. With most versions of the archie\n      client, if you\
    \ type archie with no parameters, you will get a list\n      of the possible parameters\
    \ and a short description of each. The\n      format of the command is:\n    \

    \      where the options are:\n      o\n         specifies an output file name\
    \ to store the results (not\n         available with all clients).\n      l\n\
    \         lists the result one match per line. This form is suitable for\n   \
    \      parsing by programs.\n      t\n         sorts the result inverted by date\n\
    \      m#\n         specifies maximum number of matches to return (# within the\n\
    \         range 0 to 1000). The default value is 95.\n      h archie-server\n\
    \         specifies an archie server to send the query to; if this\n         parameter\
    \ is not given, then the query will be sent to the\n         default archie server,\
    \ if one is defined.\n      L\n         lists known servers and current default\
    \ server.\n      The following group of options determines the kind of search\n\
    \      performed on the database. They are mutually exclusive.\n      s\n    \

    \  search is case insensitive.\n      c\n         as above, but the search is\
    \ case sensitive.\n      e\n         string must EXACTLY match (including case)\
    \ the file/directory\n         name in the database. This is the DEFAULT search\
    \ method.\n      r\n         searches the database using pattern. It contains\
    \ special\n         characters which must be interpreted before performing the\n\
    \         search.\n      There may be some slight differences in the options available\
    \ with\n      different clients on different platforms.\n      The result is a\
    \ list of FTP site addresses with files or\n      directories matching the argument,\
    \ the size of the file, its last\n      modification date and its directory. By\
    \ default, the list is\n      sorted by host address. See the Examples section\
    \ below for an\n      example of archie output.\n   5.4.2. Using Telnet:\n   \
    \   To access an archie server interactively, telnet to one of the\n      existing\
    \ servers (see the list of servers in the section How to\n      get to ARCHIE\
    \ above). At the login: prompt enter archie, the login\n      procedure ends leaving\
    \ the user at a archie> prompt. The server is\n      ready for user requests.\
    \ The following commands are available:\n      exit, quit, bye\n         exits\
    \ archie.\n      help  <command-name>\n         invokes the on-line help. If issued\
    \ with commandname, the help\n         request is restricted to the specified\
    \ topic. Pressing the\n         RETURN key exits from the on-line help.\n    \
    \  list  <pattern>\n         provides a list of the sites in the database and\
    \ the time at\n         which they were last updated. The optional parameter limits\
    \ the\n         list to sites matching pattern. The result is a list of site\n\
    \         names, sites IP address and date of the last update in the\n       \
    \  database. The command list with no pattern will list all sites\n         in\
    \ the database (more than 1000 sites!). E.g.,\n              list \\.de$\n   \
    \      will list all German sites\n      site(*)  site-name\n         lists the\
    \ directories and, recursively, the subdirectories, of\n         site-name in\
    \ the database. The result may be very long.\n      whatis  string\n         searches\
    \ the database of software package descriptions for\n         string. The search\
    \ is case-insensitive.\n      prog  string  |  pattern\n      find(+)  string\
    \  |  pattern\n         searches the database for string or pattern which represents\n\
    \         the name of the resource to be found in the database. Searches\n   \
    \      may be performed in a number of different ways specified in the\n     \
    \    variable search (set command) which also decides the\n         interpretation\
    \ of the parameter as string or pattern. The\n         result is a list of FTP\
    \ site addresses with matching entries,\n         the size of the resource, its\
    \ last modification date and the\n         directory to find it. The number of\
    \ hits is limited by the\n         maxhits variable (set command). The result\
    \ of prog can be\n         sorted in different ways, depending on the value of\
    \ the sortby\n         variable (set command). By default, the variables search,\n\
    \         maxhits and sortby are set to, respectively, exact match search\n  \
    \       on string, 1000 hits and unsorted resulting list. Typing the\n       \
    \  keyboard interrupt character during a search will abort it. The\n         results\
    \ up to that time are displayed. See the Examples section\n         below for\
    \ an example of the prog command and its results.\n      mail  <email>  <,email2...>\n\
    \         sends the result of the last command in a mail message to the\n    \
    \     specified e-mail address(es). If issued with no argument, the\n        \
    \ result is sent to the address specified in the variable mailto\n         (set\
    \ command).\n      show  <variable>\n         displays the value of the given\
    \ variable name. If issued with\n         no argument, it displays all variables.\
    \ See the set command\n         below for the possible variables.\n      set \
    \ variable  value\n         sets one of the archie's variables. Values of these\
    \ variables\n         affect how archie interacts with the user.\n      Variables\
    \ and values are:\n      compress(+)  compress-method\n         specifies the\
    \ compression method (none or compress) to be used\n         before mailing a\
    \ result with the mail command. The default is\n         none.\n      encode(+)\
    \  encode-method\n         specifies the encoding method (none or uuencode) to\
    \ be used\n         before mailing a result with the mail command. This variable\
    \ is\n         ignored if compress is not set. The default is none.\n      mailto\
    \  email  <,email2 ...>\n         specifies the e-mail address(es) to mail the\
    \ result of the last\n         command when mail is issued with no arguments.\n\

    \      Users limited to electronic mail connectivity can access the\n      archie\
    \ servers by sending mail to the domain address of one of the\n      servers listed\
    \ in the section How to get to ARCHIE (e.g.,\n      archie@archie.ac.il).  The\
    \ commands are sent in the body part of\n      the mail.\n      The electronic\
    \ mail interface to an archie server recognizes a\n      subset of the commands\
    \ described in Using Telnet. Most useful\n      commands and particularities to\
    \ the e-mail interface are described\n      below. If an empty message, or a message\
    \ containing no valid\n      requests is received, it will be considered to be\
    \ a help request.\n      Command lines begin in the first column. All lines that\
    \ do not\n      match a valid command are ignored. The Subject: line is processed\n\
    \      as if it were part of the message body.\n      help\n         sends you\
    \ the help file. The help command is exclusive, ie,\n         other commands in\
    \ the same message are ignored.\n      path  return-address\n         set mailto(+)\
    \  return-address\n         specifies a return e-mail address different from that\
    \ which is\n         extracted from the message header. If you do not receive\
    \ a\n         reply from the archie server within several hours, you might\n \
    \        need to add a path command to your message request.\n      list  pattern\
    \  <pattern2 ...>\n         provides a list of the sites in the database that\
    \ match pattern\n         and the time at which they were last updated. The result\
    \ is a\n         list with site names, sites IP address and date of the last\n\
    \         update in the database.\n      site(*)  site-name\n         lists the\
    \ directories and, recursively, the subdirectories, of\n         site-name in\
    \ the database.\n      whatis  string  <string2 ...>\n         searches the database\
    \ of software packages descriptions for\n         each string.  The search is\
    \ case insensitive.\n      prog  pattern  <pattern2 ...>\n         find(+)  pattern\
    \  <pattern2>\n         searches the database for each interpretation of pattern\
    \ which\n         represents the name of a resource to be found in the database.\n\
    \         If multiple patterns are placed on one line, in that case, the\n   \
    \      results will be mailed back in one message. If multiple prog\n        \
    \ lines appear, then multiple messages will be returned, one for\n         each\
    \ prog line. Results are sorted by FTP site address in\n         lexical order.\
    \ If pattern contains spaces, it must be quoted\n         with single (') or double\
    \ (\") quotes. The search is case\n         insensitive.\n      compress(*)\n\
    \         causes the result of the current request to be compressed and\n    \
    \     uuencoded. When you receive the reply, you should run it\n         through\
    \ uudecode. This will produce a .Z file. You can then run\n         uncompress\
    \ on this file and get the result of your request\n      set compress(+)  compress-method\n\
    \         specifies the compression method (none or compress) to be used\n   \
    \      before mailing the result of the current request. The default\n       \
    \  is none.\n      set encode(+)  encode-method\n         specifies the encoding\
    \ method (none or uuencode) to be used\n         before mailing the result of\
    \ the current request. This variable\n         is ignored if compress is not set.\
    \ The default is none.\n         Note: set compress compress and set encode uuencode\
    \ would\n         produce the same result as the former compress command.\n  \
    \    quit\n         nothing past this point is interpreted. Useful when a signature\n\
    \         is automatically appended at the end of your mail messages.\n      Description\
    \ of pattern\n      A pattern describes a character string including characters\
    \ which\n      take a special meaning. The special meaning is lost when \"\\\"\
    \ is\n      put before the character. The special characters are:\n       .\n\
    \         (period) this is the wildcard character that replaces any other\n  \
    \       character, e.g., \"....\" will match any 4 character string.\n      ^\n\
    \         (caret) if \"^\" appears at the beginning of the pattern, then\n   \
    \      the searched string must start with the substring following the\n     \
    \    \"^\". If it occurs anywhere else in the pattern it is regarded\n       \
    \  as non-special, e.g.:\n              \"^efghi\" will match \"efghi\" or \"\
    efghijlk\" but not\n              \"abcefghi\"\n      $\n         (dollar) if\
    \ \"$\" appears at the end of the pattern, then the\n         searched string\
    \ must end with the substring preceding the \"$\".\n         If occurring anywhere\
    \ else in the pattern, it is regarded as\n         non-special, e.g.:\n      \
    \        \"efghi$\" will match \"efghi\" or \"abcdefghi\" but not\n          \
    \    \"efghijkl\"\n"

- title: 6.1. What is WHOIS
  contents:
  - "6.1. What is WHOIS\n   WHOIS provides directory service to network users. This\
    \ service is a\n   way of finding e-mail addresses, postal addresses and telephone\n\
    \   numbers. It may also deliver information about networks, networking\n   organizations,\
    \ domains and sites.\n   The main database of networking-related names (organizations,\
    \ sites,\n   networks, people, etc.) is maintained by the Internet Registration\n\
    \   Service (InterNIC). Actually, the names of the administrative and\n   technical\
    \ contacts for registered domains are automatically entered\n   into the database\
    \ when domain or IP number applications are processed\n   by the Internet coordination\
    \ authority. Each entry of the database\n   has a handle (a unique identifier),\
    \ a name, a record type, and\n   various other fields depending on the type of\
    \ record. This database\n   will be used as an example in the descriptions below.\n\
    \   Before April 1, 1993, the Network Information Center (NIC) of the\n   Defense\
    \ Data Network (DDN) was the Internet coordination authority\n   and, therefore,\
    \ maintained the database (known as the NIC database).\n   The NIC database is\
    \ now restricted to information about the .mil\n   domain. Many documents still\
    \ refer to these names.\n   Many academic sites maintain their own database to\
    \ offer information\n   about their staff members and students.\n   In its current\
    \ implementation, WHOIS has some limitations which\n   prevent it from becoming\
    \ an efficient directory service for a large\n   volume of information and numerous\
    \ requests: the various WHOIS\n   servers have no knowledge of each other, a database\
    \ is maintained at\n   each server site, and, finally, new functionalities have\
    \ been\n   implemented locally at various sites and not propagated. A new\n  \
    \ extended protocol, WHOIS++, is being specified to improve the current\n   service.\
    \ WHOIS++ will include local enhancements to the WHOIS\n   service, an improved\
    \ query syntax and its architecture will allow a\n   real distributed directory\
    \ service for the entire Internet.\n   This new protocol for directory services\
    \ will be made available\n   shortly.\n"
- title: 6.2. Who can use WHOIS
  contents:
  - "6.2. Who can use WHOIS\n   WHOIS is available to users on the international TCP/IP\
    \ network (the\n   Internet).\n   A WHOIS server is accessible across the network\
    \ from a user program\n   running on local machines or via an interactive Telnet\
    \ session to the\n   site which hosts the server.\n   In addition, the InterNIC\
    \ offers an electronic mail interface to the\n   database it maintains, allowing\
    \ users not on the Internet or users\n   with electronic mail only to access this\
    \ information. This type of\n   access is described below in the Using WHOIS section.\n\
    \   In general, WHOIS servers should only be used for isolated queries\n   about\
    \ specific information. Typically, it is not acceptable to make\n   an extended\
    \ series of queries to obtain large sections of the\n   directory.  Such a strategy\
    \ is unfair both because of excessive\n   consumption of server resources, and\
    \ because the directory\n   information belongs to individuals. In particular,\
    \ extracting lists\n   of people for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited.\n"
- title: 6.3. How to get to WHOIS
  contents:
  - "6.3. How to get to WHOIS\n   There are many WHOIS servers throughout the network\
    \ and a\n   comprehensive list would be too long to be included here. A WHOIS\n\
    \   server offers information about the organization to which it belongs:\n  \
    \ it doesn't share a common directory with other WHOIS servers and\n   doesn't\
    \ know either where to find information about other\n   institutions.\n"
- title: 6.4. Using WHOIS
  contents:
  - "6.4. Using WHOIS\n   WHOIS has become the familiar name of the user program for\
    \ accessing\n   a WHOIS database, although NICNAME is the original name.\n   In\
    \ the following, angle brackets (<>) indicate an optional parameter.\n   6.4.1.\
    \ Using a local client:\n      Unix computers have a native whois command. On\
    \ non-Unix machines,\n      ask your system administrator whether your computer\
    \ has it or not.\n      This command searches the database on the specified site\
    \ for entry\n      which contains identifier. The format is:\n      +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\
    \      |                                                               |\n   \

    \      where:\n      site-name\n         is the domain address of the site which\
    \ hosts the database you\n         want to query (e.g., whois.internic.net). On\
    \ some\n         installations, the default value is still set to the old NIC\n\
    \         database site (nic.ddn.mil).\n      identifier\n         is a name (person,\
    \ host, domain or network), an IP number or a\n         handle.\n      Special\
    \ characters may be used in identifier to specify the\n      search:\n       .\n\

- title: 7.1. What is X.500
  contents:
  - "7.1. What is X.500\n   X.500 is an OSI (Open System Information) based directory\
    \ services\n   protocol designed by the CCITT (International Telegraph and Telephone\n\
    \   Consultative Committee).\n   X.500 provides distributed directory services\
    \ to network users. The\n   X.500 directory specifies a model for connecting directory\
    \ services\n   to form one distributed global directory. Each directory service\n\
    \   holds a part of the global database and the directory information is\n   made\
    \ available via a server (called a Directory System Agent - DSA).\n   The database\
    \ is maintained locally. From the user point of view, the\n   entire directory\
    \ is accessible from the local server.\n   While most of the information available\
    \ today via X.500 is about\n   people and organizations, the design of the X.500\
    \ directory is also\n   suitable for storing information about other entities\
    \ (or objects),\n   such as network resources, applications or hardware. Several\
    \ projects\n   are underway which utilize these directory capabilities (e.g.,\
    \ the\n   Internet RFCs (Request For Comments) are listed in the global\n   directory).\n\
    \   Each item (entry) in the X.500 directory describes one object (e.g.,\n   a\
    \ person, a network resource, an organization) and has a\n   Distinguished Name\
    \ - DN (a unique identifier). It consists of a\n   collection of attributes (e.g.,\
    \ last name, organization name, e-\n   mail,...- for a person).  The information\
    \ held in the X.500 directory\n   (or Directory Information Base - DIB) is arranged\
    \ hierarchically.\n   This organization is called the Directory Information Tree\
    \ (DIT). At\n   the top-level is the root entry (the World), then the country\
    \ level,\n   then the organization level, and, eventually, the people, the\n \
    \  resources, etc., at the bottom-level of the hierarchy.\n"
- title: 7.2. Who can use X.500
  contents:
  - "7.2. Who can use X.500\n   Although X.500 is part of the OSI standard definition,\
    \ OSI access is\n   not necessary to use the directory services. Many X.500 services\
    \ are\n   available on the Internet. In addition, users on any network can\n \
    \  access the X.500 directory by electronic mail. See the section Using\n   X.500\
    \ below for details.\n"

  - "7.3. How to get to X.500\n   There are three ways to access the X.500 services:\
    \ via a local\n   client, interactive session (Telnet or X.25 access) or electronic\n\
    \   mail. Each type of access is described below in the Using X.500\n   section.\n\
    \   In addition, other network tools (e.g., WWW and Gopher) provide\n   access\
    \ to X.500 directory services through gateways.\n   Accessing a remote client\
    \ is an easy way to start querying the X.500\n   directory. Some sites allow public\

- title: 7.4. Using X.500
  contents:
  - "7.4. Using X.500\n   X.500 supports data management functions (addition, modification\
    \ and\n   deletion of entries) and powerful lookup capabilities. The use of\n\
    \   X.500 is primarily for its lookup capabilities, ie, querying a\n   database\
    \ for information on a person (postal address, telephone\n   number, e-mail address,\
    \ etc.). The basic fields for searching are the\n   person's name, the name of\
    \ the person's organization (and department\n   within the organization) and the\
    \ country.\n   In the following, angle brackets (<>) indicate an optional parameter;\n\
    \   a vertical (|) indicates a choice of parameters.\n   7.4.1. Using a local\
    \ client:\n      In the X.500 world, a local client is called a Directory User\n\
    \      Agent (DUA) Public domain and commercial DUAs are available for\n     \
    \ numerous platforms ranging from mainframes to personal computers.\n      For\
    \ a comprehensive list of DUAs, their description and where to\n      find them,\
    \ consult the Internet document RFC 1292 - A Catalog of\n      Available X.500\
    \ Implementations.\n      Available DUAs range from simple line commands to sophisticated\n\
    \      graphical user interfaces which require a pointing device.\n   7.4.2. Using\
    \ Telnet or X.25:\n      3 categories of user interfaces might be available at\
    \ the remote\n      site:\n         * line-oriented: de, dish, fred\n        \
    \ * menu-driven: sd (formerly known as widget)\n         * X-Windows-based: Xdi,\
    \ Xlookup (or xlu), pod\n      Capabilities of these DUAs range from basic search\
    \ facilities to\n      full X.500 functionality.\n      de (directory enquiries)\
    \ is recommended for novice users since it\n      is a very simple user-interface.\
    \ It has been designed to run as a\n      public access DUA and is accessible\
    \ from any kind of terminal. It\n      supports the basic X.500 functions: read,\
    \ search, list. The Simple\n      query mode is suitable for those who are new\
    \ to querying the X.500\n      directory.\n      de\n         invokes the X.500\
    \ interrogation user-interface.\n      q\n         exits de.\n      ?<topic>\n\
    \         displays the on-line help on the specified topic or general\n      \
    \   help.\n      ^C\n         (Ctrl-C) is the interrupt character. It aborts a\
    \ search in\n         progress or resets the current query specification.\n  \
    \    *\n         (asterisk) will list all entries of the specified field. It is\n\
    \         also the wildcard character and can replace any other character\n  \
    \       in a name. It can appears anywhere in the name, e.g.: smit* or\n     \
    \    *smit* are valid string formats.\n      -\n         resets the default value\
    \ to a blank string.\n      When de is invoked, the user is requested to fill\
    \ in 4 fields to\n      specify a request. In all fields, the value from the previous\n\
    \      request is the default value. Press the RETURN key to accept it,\n    \
    \  or enter a new value.  All searches are case insensitive.\n      The four fields\
    \ to be filled in are:\n      Person's name\n         Wildcard characters may\
    \ be used anywhere in the name. All\n         matching names will be listed. Typing\
    \ only \"*\" will match all\n         people of the specified department or organization.\
    \ If this\n         field is blank, the search will be on department or\n    \
    \     organization only.\n      Department name\n         the name (or an acronym)\
    \ of the department in the organization\n         where the person works. Wildcard\
    \ characters may be used\n         anywhere in the name.  Typing only \"*\" will\
    \ match all\n         departments. If no person's name has been entered, details\
    \ on\n         the department are displayed, otherwise, the search is carried\n\
    \         out with the selected name. If no department name is given, all\n  \
    \       departments will be searched. This field could be omitted in\n       \
    \  small organizations.\n      Organization name\n         the name  (or an acronym)\
    \  of the  organization where the\n         person works.  Wildcard characters\
    \  may be used anywhere  in\n         the name. Typing  only \"*\" will match\
    \ all organizations. If no\n         person's name or department name has been\
    \ entered, details on\n         the organization are displayed, otherwise, the\
    \ search is\n         carried out with the selected name.\n      Country name\n\
    \         the name of the country where the person works. Typing \"*\" will\n\
    \         list all countries. The country name could be the 2-letter\n       \
    \  country code (e.g., DK stands for Denmark), the name or a part\n         of\
    \ it without wildcards (e.g., nether instead of The\n         Netherlands).\n\
    \      If a large number of matching entries are found, they are listed\n    \
    \  so that the user can select one entry to get further details.\n   7.4.3. Using\
    \ electronic mail:\n      The Norwegian networking organization (UNINETT) offers\
    \ an e-mail\n      interface to X.500. To use it, send a mail message to:\n  \
    \    Directory@UNINETT.NO with the word find in the Subject: field. The\n    \
    \  body part contains the search request, one per message.\n      The format of\
    \ the search request is:\n      +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\
    \      |                                                               |\n   \

- title: 8.1. What is NETFIND
  contents:
  - "8.1. What is NETFIND\n   NETFIND is an Internet user directory tool. It provides\
    \ a simple\n   Internet white pages directory facility.\n   Given the name of\
    \ a person on the Internet and a rough description of\n   where the person works,\
    \ Netfind attempts to locate telephone and\n   electronic mailbox information\
    \ about the person. It does so using a\n   seed database of domains and hosts\
    \ in the network.\n   Netfind finds information about people through the Internet\
    \ protocols\n   SMTP and finger. If the person being sought is at a site that\
    \ is not\n   directly connected to the Internet (e.g., the site is connected only\n\
    \   through a mail forwarding gateway), Netfind informs the user that the\n  \
    \ person can not be found.\n   Due to the dynamic nature of Netfind's search procedures\
    \ and\n   variations in Internet availability, different results can be\n   obtained\
    \ for the same search on different occasions.\n   The Netfind software can only\
    \ run on Suns running SunOS 4.0 or more\n   recent.\n"
- title: 8.2. Who can use NETFIND
  contents:
  - "8.2. Who can use NETFIND\n   You must be on the international TCP/IP network\
    \ (the Internet) in\n   order to use Netfind. Moreover, Netfind can only find\
    \ information on\n   users who are on the Internet.\n   There is no e-mail access\
    \ to Netfind.\n"
- title: 8.3. How to get to NETFIND
  contents:
  - "8.3. How to get to NETFIND\n   You can access Netfind through software at your\

- title: 8.4. Using NETFIND
  contents:
  - "8.4. Using NETFIND\n   To use Netfind, you give it the name of a person and keywords\n\
    \   indicating where that person works. After you specify a search,\n   Netfind\
    \ looks in its seed database to find domains matching the\n   specified keywords.\
    \ If there is more than one matching domain,\n   Netfind displays the list of\
    \ matching domains, and asks you to select\n   up to three to search. If the keys\
    \ you specified match more than 100\n   domains, Netfind will list some of the\
    \ matching domains/organizations\n   and ask you to form a more specific search.\
    \ You can use any of the\n   parts of an organization's name (or any of the components\
    \ of its\n   domain name) as keys in searches. Using more than one key implies\
    \ the\n   logical AND of the keys. Specifying too many keys may cause searches\n\
    \   to fail.\n   When it completes the search (or when interrupted by <circ>C),\n\
    \   Netfind summarizes the search results. The summary includes problems\n   searching\
    \ remote domains, information about the most promising e-mail\n   address for\
    \ the person being sought (if available), and information\n   about when and where\
    \ the person most recently/is currently logged in\n   (if available).  If more\
    \ than one person is located by a search, the\n   summary does not include information\
    \ about e-mail targets and most\n   recent/current logins (since only the user\
    \ can decide which person\n   was the correct one)\n   8.4.1. Local access:\n\
    \      The format of the Netfind command is:\n      +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\
    \      |                                                               |\n   \
    \   |  netfind   <options>  name-keyword  place-keywords            |\n      |\
    \                                                               |\n      +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\
    \      where the options are:\n      -h\n         tells Netfind to skip the domain\
    \ search phase, and immediately\n         begin searching individual machines\
    \ found in the seed database.\n         This option exists for measurement purposes.\
    \ It is not of much\n         use to casual users.\n      -s\n         will disable\
    \ usage of the SMTP protocol during searches. This\n         option is mainly\
    \ useful for measurement purposes. Without this\n         protocol, searches will\
    \ begin producing finger output slightly\n         sooner, but will often search\
    \ less useful machines, generate\n         more Internet load, and fail to find\
    \ information for users at\n         sites that do not support finger (such as\
    \ many companies).\n      -t\n         will report how many timeouts occurred.\
    \ The -T option will set\n         the timeout interval to the specified number\
    \ of seconds. It may\n         be necessary to use this option to increase the\
    \ timeout value\n         for intercontinental searches.\n      -D\n         sets\
    \ the maximum number of domains that Netfind will search at\n         once. The\
    \ default is 3. While it may seem convenient to set a\n         high value for\
    \ this number, we suggest you do not do this. The\n         search will actually\
    \ proceed faster (and waste less Internet\n         bandwidth) if a small number\
    \ of well chosen domains are\n         searched.\n      -H\n         sets the\
    \ maximum number of machines that will be searched by\n         Netfind.  The\
    \ default value is 50. Again, we suggest that you\n         do not set this value\
    \ higher.\n      -m\n         displays measurement information. If no filename\
    \ is specified,\n         measurements are output to stderr. The packet count\
    \ estimates\n         are usually exaggerated, because they make pessimistic\n\
    \         assumptions about the state of the Domain Naming System.\n      -d\n\
    \         allows you to turn on various classes of debugging output (all\n   \
    \      of which are output to stderr), using a letter corresponding to\n     \
    \    each one.  Debugging output is enabled using the -d option with\n       \
    \  a list of letters, e.g., -dslf. The following classes/letters\n         exist:\n\
    \         c:\n            display control messages (check if the program has reached\
    \ a\n            specified point)\n            f: display finger related messages\n\
    \         h:\n            list machine names found in the seed database\n    \
    \     l:\n            display lock related messages (when entering monitors)\n\
    \         m:\n            display messages about mail protocol (SMTP)\n      \
    \   n:\n            display messages about network failures\n         r:\n   \
    \         display hosts matched from the seed database that were\n           \
    \ rejected from searches because of search scope selection\n         s:\n    \
    \        display system call related messages\n         t:\n            display\
    \ thread related messages\n         A:\n            convert the above flags to\
    \ mean their complement (example\n            -dAt means produce all debug output\
    \ except that for\n            threads).\n         The letters that are most likely\
    \ to be of interest to the\n         casual user are f, m, and n. By default,\
    \ these options are\n         enabled. Specifying any of these three flags with\
    \ -d on the\n         command line will disable them (hence, the -d option toggles\n\
    \         the default behavior of each of the flags).\n         The name keyword\
    \ specifies the person being sought by first,\n         last, or login name (only\
    \ one name can be specified).\n         The place keywords describe where the\
    \ person works, by either\n         the name of the institution or the city/state/country.\
    \ If you\n         know the institution's domain name (e.g., cs.colorado.edu,\n\
    \         where there are host names like brazil.cs.colorado.edu) you can\n  \
    \       specify it as keys without the dots (e.g., cs colorado edu).\n       \
    \  The host parts of domain names (brazil) cannot be used as\n         keywords.\
    \ Keys are case insensitive and may be specified in any\n         order, although\
    \ using a very common key (like university) first\n         will cause internal\
    \ buffers to overflow and some domains to be\n         missed.\n         Using\
    \ more than one key implies the logical and of the keys.\n         Specifying\
    \ too many keys may cause searches to fail. If this\n         happens, try specifying\
    \ fewer keys.\n   8.4.2. Remote access:\n      Telnet to one of the remote Netfind\
    \ sites (see How to get to\n      NETFIND, above) and log in as netfind. No password\
    \ is necessary.\n      You will get the following menu:\n           Top level\
    \ choices:\n                   1. Help\n                   2. Search\n       \

  contents:
  - "10.1. What is BITFTP\n   BITFTP, BITNET FTP Server, allows users of EARN, Bitnet\
    \ and\n   associated networks to access FTP sites on the Internet.\n   The BITFTP\
    \ server provides a mail interface between a user on the\n   EARN/Bitnet network\
    \ to FTP sites on the Internet. BITFTP handles this\n   task by passing the commands\
    \ specified in the mail message from the\n   user to another server that actually\
    \ makes the connection to the FTP\n   sites.  When the server finishes the interaction\
    \ with the FTP site,\n   or fails due to an error, a transcript of the result\
    \ is sent back to\n   the user, as well as the requested file(s), if any.\n  \
    \ The format of the files sent to the user can be defined within the\n   mail\
    \ message. BITFTP can deliver files in netdata and uuencode\n   formats.\n"

- title: 11.1. What is LISTSERV
  contents:
  - "11.1. What is LISTSERV\n   LISTSERV is a distribution list management package.\
    \ It runs on IBM\n   VM/CMS systems in the international NJE network (EARN/ Bitnet).\
    \ It\n   allows groups of computer users with a common interest to communicate\n\
    \   among themselves, while making efficient use of computer and network\n   resources.\
    \ It makes it easy for even novice users to discover, join,\n   and participate\
    \ in these interest group mailing lists. LISTSERV also\n   provides facilities\
    \ for logging and archiving of mail traffic, file\n   server functions, and database\
    \ searches of archives and files.\n   There are LISTSERV lists on every subject\
    \ under the sun, with names\n   ranging from AARPUB-L (AAR Electronic Publication\
    \ list) to Z3950IW\n   (Z39.50 Implementors Workshop). LISTSERV lists are international\
    \ and\n   eclectic. You will find lists in every imaginable field, for every\n\
    \   audience, in many different countries and in many different\n   languages.\
    \  See the description of the List command in the section\n   Using LISTSERV section\
    \ for instructions on getting an up-to-date list\n   of lists.\n"
- title: 11.2. Who can use LISTSERV
  contents:
  - "11.2. Who can use LISTSERV\n   Anyone who can send electronic mail to an EARN/Bitnet\
    \ address can\n   participate in a mailing list and access other LISTSERV facilities,\n\
    \   as long as the e-mail format is valid (according to the RFC822\n   standard),\
    \ and has a usable return address. Every day, people use\n   LISTSERV from HEPnet,\
    \ Internet, Compuserve, MCIMail and many other\n   networks throughout the world.\n\
    \   If you don't know how to send electronic mail to EARN/Bitnet, ask\n   your\
    \ local support people for help.\n"
- title: 11.3. How to get to LISTSERV
  contents:
  - "11.3. How to get to LISTSERV\n   To use LISTSERV facilities, send electronic\
    \ mail with your LISTSERV\n   commands to: LISTSERV@host-id where host-id is the\
    \ host computer's\n   NJE address (for example, TAUNIVM.BITNET) or its Internet\
    \ domain name\n   (in this case, VM.TAU.AC.IL). There may be some local variation\
    \ on\n   the format needed to send mail to Bitnet or Internet addresses. Check\n\
    \   with your local support personnel.\n   More than one command can be sent to\
    \ LISTSERV in the same mail\n   message.  Each command must be on a separate line.\
    \ LISTSERV will\n   ignore the Subject: line of the mail header, so ensure that\
    \ your\n   commands are in the body of the e-mail.\n   For EARN/Bitnet users,\
    \ interactive messages are the fastest and most\n   convenient way to send commands\
    \ to LISTSERV, but bear in mind that\n   interactive messages only work when the\
    \ links between your computer\n   and LISTSERV are up; if the message fails, you\
    \ can always send your\n   command via mail.\n   To facilitate communications\
    \ with the LISTSERV servers on the\n   EARN/Bitnet network, a special LISTSERV\
    \ computer node has been\n   defined.  This means that any EARN/Bitnet user can\
    \ address their\n   commands to the userid LISTSERV at the special node LISTSERV.\n\
    \   All non-EARN/Bitnet users may address their command mail to the\n   userid\
    \ LISTSERV at the special node LISTSERV.NET. Note that if this\n   node is not\
    \ yet defined on your network, you may also try\n   LISTSERV%LISTSERV.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU.\
    \ For example, if you wanted\n   to join the 3D-L mailing list that discusses\
    \ 3D computer graphics but\n   are not sure of the address of the LISTSERV server\
    \ hosting this list.\n   You could send a subscription request to either of the\
    \ following\n   addresses:\n        LISTSERV@LISTSERV.NET\n        LISTSERV@LISTSERV\
    \ (on BITNET)\n   Your subscription request will be automatically forwarded on\
    \ to the\n   LISTSERV server hosting the 3D-L mailing list (in this case, at the\n\
    \   computer node ARIZVM1 or ARIZVM1.CCIT.ARIZONA.EDU).\n   You may also utilize\
    \ the special LISTSERV address to send e-mail to\n   any LISTSERV mailing list\
    \ if you are unsure of its address. For\n   example, if you wanted to send mail\
    \ to the BITFTP-L mailing list to\n   request a copy of the BITFTP product, you\
    \ could do so by addressing\n   your e-mail to BITFTP-L@LISTSERV.NET. It will\
    \ automatically be\n   forwarded to the list's real address (in this case,\n \
    \  BITFTP-L@EARNCC.EARN.NET) when it reaches the LISTSERV node. Once you\n   know\
    \ the real address of a list, it should be used for all future\n   mail sent to\
    \ that list.\n   There are more than 250 sites in over 30 countries throughout\
    \ the\n   world running LISTSERV as part of the world-wide network. Here are a\n\

- title: 11.4. Using LISTSERV
  contents:
  - "11.4. Using LISTSERV\n   The commands given here are available for everyone and\
    \ require no\n   special LISTSERV command privileges. Only the most common commands\n\
    \   are described. For a complete list of non-privileged LISTSERV\n   commands,\
    \ retrieve the LISTSERV User Guide in the DOC FILELIST from\n   LISTSERV@EARNCC.EARN.NET\
    \ (or LISTSERV@EARNCC.BITNET).\n   Commands are presented in a particular format:\
    \ CAPITAL letters\n   indicate acceptable abbreviation, angle brackets (<>) indicate\
    \ an\n   optional parameter, and vertical bar (|) indicates a choice of\n   parameters.\
    \ All parameters are fully explained in each command\n   description.\n   There\
    \ is a standard set of command keywords available for use in some\n   LISTSERV\
    \ commands. They may be used with any commands where they\n   appear as optional\
    \ parameters in the command description. The\n   important standard keywords are:\n\
    \   PW= password\n      This keyword is used to specify a password in a command.\
    \ If you\n      have registered a personal password on a LISTSERV server, you\
    \ will\n      then have to validate certain commands by using the PW= command\n\
    \      keyword in the command text. This feature is designed to prevent\n    \
    \  impostors from issuing commands while using your e-mail address.\n      The\
    \ use of passwords is strongly recommended for this reason. See\n      the PW\
    \ command for details on registering personal passwords. Once\n      you have\
    \ registered a personal password at a LISTSERV server, you\n      will be obliged\
    \ to include the PW= command keyword in all commands\n      where it appears as\
    \ an option.\n   F= format\n      This keyword controls the file format (or internal\
    \ file structure)\n      in which files will be sent to you. If you are not a\
    \ member of the\n      EARN/Bitnet network, then LISTSERV will always use the\
    \ default\n      file format of MAIL. Otherwise, the default file format is\n\
    \      dependent upon the information held in the BITEARN NODES file\n      regarding\
    \ your computer. The BITEARN NODES file is a special\n      network definition\
    \ file used in the EARN/Bitnet network. Any user\n      may ask for a file format\
    \ other than their default by specifying\n      it in the F= command keyword in\
    \ the commands where it appears as\n      an option. Note that this will not permanently\
    \ change your default\n      file format, its effect is only for those commands\
    \ where it is\n      specified. Following is a list of file formats that are valid\
    \ for\n      all users:\n           XXE  UUe  MIME/text  MIME/Appl  MAIL\n   \
    \   In addition, EARN/Bitnet users may specify:\n           Netdata  Card  Disk\
    \  Punch  LPunch  VMSdump\n      Contact your local support personnel for more\
    \ information about\n      the file formats supported on your computer.\n   11.4.1.\
    \ Commands for LISTS:\n      The primary function of LISTSERV is to operate mailing\
    \ lists (also\n      referred to as distribution lists). Mailing lists are used\
    \ to\n      distribute the e-mail sent to them to a list a recipients. They\n\
    \      provide the means for a group of users to establish an e-mail\n      forum\
    \ on any topic or area of common interest. This service\n      provides an extremely\
    \ convenient means for the exchange of ideas\n      and information between list\
    \ members since LISTSERV (and not the\n      mail sender) manages the distribution\
    \ of e-mail to all of its\n      final recipients. Users need only to remember\
    \ one list address to\n      which they send their mail in order to communicate\
    \ to a\n      potentially large number of users. Due to the efficiency with\n\
    \      which LISTSERV distributes e-mail to list members, discussions or\n   \
    \   debates with a world-wide audience may be conducted.\n      The following\
    \ commands are designed for use with LISTSERV mailing\n      lists.  With them\
    \ you may do things such as finding the names and\n      addresses of lists, signing\
    \ on to or off lists, reviewing lists or\n      changing your personal options\
    \ for any mailing list to which you\n      are subscribed.\n      +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\
    \      |                                                               |\n   \
    \   |  SUBscribe list-name  <full-name>                             |\n      |\
    \                                                               |\n      +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\
    \      Use the SUBscribe command to join a mailing list. You can also use\n  \
    \    this command to alter the name (but not e-mail address) by which\n      you\
    \ are known on a mailing list you have already joined. The\n      list-name parameter\
    \ is the name of the list to which you want to\n      subscribe. For example,\
    \ the EARN User Group list located at the\n      node IRLEARN has a list name\
    \ of EARN-UG. Do not confuse this with\n      the list's address (EARN-UG@IRLEARN)\
    \ which should not be used. The\n      optional full-name parameter allows you\
    \ to give a name by which\n      you want to be known on a mailing list. If specified,\
    \ it should be\n      your full, real name (at least your first name and last\
    \ name) and\n      not your e-mail address. If you send this command to LISTSERV\
    \ via\n      command mail, the name for the full-name option will be taken from\n\
    \      the name given in the From: mail header should it be omitted from\n   \
    \   the command text. If you send a SUBscribe command for a list to\n      which\
    \ you already belong, then LISTSERV will interpret the command\n      as a request\
    \ to change your full-name on the list.\n      A request to join a mailing list\
    \ can be processed in three ways:\n      subscription to a list may be OPEN, CLOSED,\
    \ or BY-OWNER. If it is\n      OPEN, you will be automatically added to the list\
    \ and sent\n      notification. If it is CLOSED, you will not be added to the\
    \ list,\n      and LISTSERV will send you a message telling you that your request\n\
    \      has been rejected. If it is BY-OWNER, your subscription request\n     \
    \ will be forwarded to the list owner(s), who will decide whether or\n      not\
    \ to add you to the list (LISTSERV will inform you to whom your\n      request\
    \ has been forwarded). To see what kind of subscription a\n      list has, use\
    \ the REView command.\n      +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\
    \      |                                                               |\n   \

    \      Use the UNSubscribe command to leave a mailing list. The listname\n   \
    \   parameter is the name of a mailing list from which you want to\n      remove\
    \ your subscription. You can signoff all the lists to which\n      you are a member\
    \ at any particular LISTSERV site by using the \"*\"\n      (asterisk) character\
    \ in the place of a list name. If you want your\n      UNSubscribe command to\
    \ be propagated to all LISTSERV servers on\n      the network, include the (NETWIDE\
    \ option. Use this option if you\n      are changing your e-mail address or are\
    \ leaving your computer for\n      an extended period.\n      +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\

    \ of the lists managed by a LISTSERV server.\n      Global <pattern>\n       \
    \  This option gives a complete list of all known LISTSERV mailing\n         lists\
    \ at all servers at the time the command is issued. A file\n         (called LISTSERV\
    \ LISTS) will be sent to you containing the\n         names, titles and e-mail\
    \ addresses of these lists. This is a\n         very large file, so make sure\
    \ you have the necessary disk space\n         to accommodate its size before you\
    \ use the Global option. The\n         optional pattern parameter can be used\
    \ to match any string in\n         the list name, list title or list address.\n\

    \      Use the REView command to receive a listing of a mailing list. It\n   \
    \   will be sent to you as a file called list-name LIST (or list-name\n      node-name\
    \ for peered lists). A mailing list is comprised of two\n      parts: a control\
    \ section and a subscription section. The control\n      section holds the definition\
    \ parameters for a list which includes\n      information such as who is authorized\
    \ to review or join a list and\n      whether or not it is archived. The subscription\
    \ section holds the\n      e-mail addresses and names of all list members. The\
    \ REView command\n      allows you to receive a listing of either or both of these\n\
    \      sections (the default is both) for any list, provided you are\n      authorized\
    \ to do so. Note that at the discretion of the list\n      owner(s), the REView\
    \ command can be restricted in use to list\n      members only. In this case,\
    \ you will not be authorized to review a\n      mailing list if you are not a\
    \ member of that list yourself. Also,\n      individual list members can restrict\
    \ the appearance of their\n      e-mail address and name in response to a REView\
    \ command if they\n      have set the CONCEAL mailing list option (see the SET\
    \ command for\n      more details). The list-name parameter is the name of the\
    \ LISTSERV\n      list you wish to review.  The important options are:\n     \
    \ Short\n         This option restricts the information you receive to the\n \
    \        control section of a list (giving its definition parameters)\n      \
    \   and does not return the subscription section of a list (giving\n         the\
    \ list members).\n      Countries\n         If you use this option, the list of\
    \ members will be by the\n         nationality given in their e-mail.\n      LOCal\n\
    \         If the list is peered (that is, it is linked to other mailing\n    \
    \     lists of the same name but on different LISTSERV servers), you\n       \
    \  will receive listings of all of these mailing lists in response\n         to\
    \ a REView command.  The LOCal option can be used to suppress\n         the propagation\
    \ of the REView command to the LISTSERV servers\n         hosting these peered\
    \ mailing lists. In this case, you will\n         receive a listing only from\
    \ the server to which you send the\n         REView command and not the others.\n\

    \      When you join any mailing list, you will be assigned a default set\n  \

    \ you when it distributes mail you have sent to a list. These\n      are the personal\

    \ subscribed to suite your circumstances. See\n      the SET command for a complete\
    \ descriptions of these options. The\n      Query command can be used to review\
    \ the personal list options you\n      have in effect at any mailing list.  The\
    \ listname parameter is the\n      name of a list to which you are subscribed.\
    \ If you use an \"*\"\n      (asterisk) character instead of a list name, you\
    \ will receive\n      information about your personal options for all lists to\

    \      Use the SET command to change your personal options for a mailing\n   \
    \   list.  These options will remain in effect until they are\n      explicitly\
    \ changed.  The Query command can be used to display your\n      current optional\
    \ settings for any list to which you are\n      subscribed. The list-name parameter\
    \ is the name of the mailing\n      list for which you are changing your options.\
    \ You may change your\n      options for a specific list or for all the lists\
    \ you belong to at\n      a particular LISTSERV by using the \"*\" (asterisk)\
    \ character in\n      place of a list name. After processing your SET command,\
    \ LISTSERV\n      will send you conformation of the successful alteration of your\n\
    \      mailing list options via e-mail. The important options are:\n      Mail\
    \ | DIGests | INDex | NOMail\n         These options of the SET command alter\
    \ the way in which you\n         receive mail from a mailing list. The Mail option\
    \ means that\n         you wish to have list mail distributed to you as mail.\
    \ This is\n         the default. The DIGests and INDex options are available only\n\
    \         if a list has had these features enabled by its owner(s).\n        \
    \ Digests hold all the mail messages sent to a list over a\n         certain period\
    \ of time. Instead of receiving each mail\n         individually as it is distributed\
    \ to list members, you will\n         receive all the mail in one batch for a\
    \ given day, week or\n         month. You may then browse through these mail messages\
    \ at your\n         leisure. Note that mail is not edited with the DIGests option,\n\
    \         you will receive copies of all the mail messages in their\n        \
    \ entirety. The INDex option will provide you with only the date,\n         time,\
    \ subject, number of lines and the sender's name and\n         address for all\
    \ mail messages sent to a list. The text of the\n         mail message will not\
    \ be included. You may then select and\n         retrieve any mail that interests\
    \ you from the list archive.\n         Both the DIGests and INDex options provide\
    \ a means of listening\n         in to discussions on mailing lists without having\
    \ to deal with\n         large quantities of incoming mail messages.  The NOMail\
    \ option\n         means that mail sent to the list will not be distributed to\n\
    \         you. This is useful when you are leaving your computer for an\n    \
    \     extended period of time and you do not want mail from the list\n       \
    \  to fill your mailbox. When you return, you can send the SET\n         command\
    \ with the Mail option to restore mail service.\n      SHORThdr | FULLhdr | IETFhdr\
    \ | DUALhdr\n         All mail messages are comprised of header and body sections.\n\
    \         The header section provides details such as the recipients, the\n  \
    \       original sender and the date and time a mail message was sent.\n     \
    \    The mail body section contains the text of a mail message.\n         These\
    \ options of the SET command indicate the type of mail\n         headers you want\
    \ to receive in the mail distributed from a\n         mailing list. SHORThdr means\
    \ that the mail header will include\n         only the essential informational\
    \ headers (for instance the\n         Date:, To:, From:, Subject:, Sender: and\
    \ Reply-to: headers).\n         This is the default. You may change this to FULLhdr,\
    \ which\n         means that all (including non-essential) mail headers will be\n\
    \         present in e-mail. The IETFhdr option means that LISTSERV will\n   \
    \      not change the headers of a mail message it distributes to you\n      \
    \   other than to add a Received: mail header (and also a\n         Message-id:\
    \ and Sender: headers if either of these were not\n         already present).\
    \ This option is designed specifically for\n         compatibility with SMTP exploders\
    \ (as used, for instance, on\n         the Internet network).  Lastly, DUALhdr\
    \ is very similar to the\n         SHORThdr option except that LISTSERV will also\
    \ insert mail\n         headers at the beginning of the mail body. Therefore,\
    \ when the\n         mail is received and read by a recipient using this option,\
    \ it\n         will start with this information (for instance, the first three\n\
    \         lines of a mail message may contain the To:, From: and Subject:\n  \
    \       mail headers). This option is useful for users of some PC based\n    \
    \     mail packages that will not display this information from the\n        \
    \ real mail headers.\n      CONCEAL | NOCONCEAL\n         Indicates whether or\
    \ not you want your name and mail address to\n         appear in the display of\
    \ list members which is given in\n         response to a REView command. The default\
    \ is NOCONCEAL. Note\n         that a complete list of members is always given\
    \ to list owners\n         and LISTSERV administrators regardless of this option.\n\

    \ number of days or they\n         will be removed from the list. This command\

    \ to\n         which  you are confirming your  subscription. LISTSERV  will\n\
    \         send  a message  that your subscription has been confirmed.\n   11.4.2.\
    \ Commands for FILES:\n      LISTSERV also functions as a file server. That is,\
    \ files can be\n      stored at a LISTSERV server and made available for retrieval\
    \ by\n      users upon their request. These files are stored in LISTSERV under\n\
    \      a hierarchical system of filelists. As the name suggests, a\n      filelist\
    \ is a special file that holds a list of files. Each entry\n      in a filelist\
    \ describes a file that is available for retrieval and\n      gives details such\
    \ as the file's name and size and also a file's\n      access code (also known\
    \ as a FAC) which describes who is\n      authorized to retrieve it. These files\
    \ may themselves be\n      filelists, in which case they too will hold information\
    \ about\n      available files or further filelists. In this way, filelists are\n\
    \      organized in a hierarchical or tree structure.\n      There are two basic\
    \ types of filelists on LISTSERV servers. The\n      first type holds files that\
    \ have been specifically placed there by\n      file owners or LISTSERV administrators.\
    \ These files may be\n      documents, maps or diagrams, or even programs. The\
    \ second type of\n      filelist is associated with a LISTSERV mailing list. These\
    \ are\n      referred to as list filelists and retain copies of all e-mail\n \
    \     distributed on a particular mailing list. They consist of a series\n   \
    \   of files, each of which holds a copy of the mail messages\n      distributed\
    \ on a list over an interval of time (usually, one\n      month). These files\
    \ may then be retrieved to recover any list mail\n      distributed during a specific\
    \ period. Note that e-mail distributed\n      on a mailing list may also be retrieved\
    \ via the database functions\n      of LISTSERV. Not all mailing lists have an\
    \ associated list\n      filelist; this is enabled at a list owner's discretion.\n\
    \      A further aspect of the file server functions of LISTSERV is the\n    \
    \  concept of packages. A package consists of one or more files that\n      appear\
    \ in a filelist. These may be, for example, a series of files\n      that go to\
    \ make up a software package. A package is declared in a\n      LISTSERV filelist\
    \ through a file that has the special name of\n      package-name $PACKAGE.  Within\
    \ it will be a list of all the files\n      that comprise the package.  This list\
    \ can be reviewed by sending a\n      retrieval request for that file.  However,\
    \ all the files that\n      comprise the package may also be retrieved through\
    \ a request for\n      the file: package-name PACKAGE. Note that in this case,\
    \ the \"$\"\n      (dollar) symbol is dropped from the name. The files that go\
    \ to\n      make up the package will then automatically be sent to the\n     \
    \ requestor. This enables users to retrieve an entire set of files\n      that\
    \ belong to a package with only one command, instead of having\n      to retrieve\
    \ each of these files individually through a series of\n      commands.\n    \
    \  The following LISTSERV commands enable general users to manipulate\n      files\
    \ that are stored at a server. This includes commands to\n      search for, retrieve\
    \ and subscribe to files. When sending file\n      server commands to LISTSERV,\
    \ you must address them to the server\n      and not to any mailing lists. Note\
    \ that where the PW= keyword\n      appears in a command description, this need\
    \ only be included in\n      the command text if you have defined a personal password\
    \ at the\n      server to which you are sending file server commands. Otherwise,\n\
    \      it need not be used. The optional F= command keyword may included\n   \
    \   as desired.\n      +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\

    \      Use the INDex command to get a listing of the files in a\n      particular\
    \ filelist. The filelist parameter specifies the name of\n      the filelist you\
    \ wish to get. If no name is specified, an index of\n      the root filelist (called\

    \      The GET command is used to retrieve a specific file or package\n      from\
    \ a filelist, provided you are authorized to do so. The\n      filename and filetype\
    \ parameters identify the file or package you\n      wish to retrieve.  The optional\
    \ filelist parameter identifies the\n      filelist within which the file or package\
    \ resides. If it is not\n      supplied in the command, LISTSERV will determine\
    \ the filelist\n      through a search of its own internal filelist index.\n \

    \      AFD is an acronym for Automatic File Distribution. This command\n     \
    \ enables you to subscribe to a file or package in a filelist. Every\n      time\
    \ this file or package is updated in its filelist, you will\n      then automatically\
    \ be sent of copy of it by the LISTSERV server.\n      You may subscribe to any\
    \ number of files for packages from any\n      filelist with the AFD command.\
    \ You may also review or delete your\n      subscriptions at any LISTSERV server.\
    \ The options must be one of\n      the following:\n      ADD  filename  filetype\
    \  <filelist> <text> <PW= password>\n      <F=format>\n         The ADD option\
    \ allows you to subscribe to a file or package.\n         This means that a copy\
    \ will henceforth be sent to you\n         automatically by LISTSERV when it is\
    \ updated on its filelist.\n         The filename and filetype parameters identify\
    \ a file or package\n         to which you want to subscribe. The filelist option\
    \ allows you\n         to specify the name of the filelist in which it is located.\
    \ If\n         this is not specified in the command, LISTSERV will locate the\n\
    \         filelist through a search of its own internal filelist index.\n    \
    \     Also, if you wish to have an informational text message\n         inserted\
    \ automatically at the top of the file or package when\n         it is sent to\
    \ you, you may use the text parameter. Note that if\n         you omit the filelist\
    \ option, the text you provide in the text\n         parameter must be enclosed\
    \ in double quotes (\").  This\n         parameter is most commonly used by network\
    \ server applications\n         that subscribe to files at a LISTSERV on behalf\
    \ of users. If\n         you are subscribing to files directly from LISTSERV yourself,\n\
    \         you should not need to use this option.\n      DELete  filename  filetype\
    \  <filelist>  <PW= password>\n         Remove your subscription to a file or\
    \ package for which you\n         have an AFD.  The filename and filetype parameters\
    \ identify a\n         file or package to which you wish to remove an AFD. These\
    \ names\n         may also include the \"*\" (asterisk) wildcard character so\
    \ that\n         multiple files or packages may be removed with one DELete\n \
    \        command. The filelist option allows you to specify the name of\n    \

    \      FUI is an acronym for File Update Information. It enables you to\n    \
    \  subscribe to a file or package in a filelist. Every time this file\n      for\
    \ package is updated in its filelist, you will then\n      automatically be informed\
    \ of this by the LISTSERV server. This\n      command is similar to the AFD command,\
    \ except you will only be\n      sent notification of an update rather than the\
    \ updated file or\n      package itself. You may subscribe to any number of files\
    \ for\n      packages from any filelist with the FUI command. You may also\n \
    \     review or delete your subscriptions at any LISTSERV server. The\n      options\
    \ parameter must be one of the following:\n      ADD filename  filetype <filelist>\
    \ <PW=  password>\n         The ADD option allows you to subscribe to a file or\
    \ package by\n         adding an FUI to it. The filename and filetype parameters\n\
    \         identify a file or package to which you want to add an FUI\n       \
    \  subscription. The filelist option allows you to specify the\n         name\
    \ of the filelist in which it is located. If this is not\n         given in the\
    \ command, LISTSERV will locate the filelist through\n         a search of its\
    \ own internal filelist index.\n      DELete  filename  filetype  <filelist> \
    \ <PW= password>\n         Remove your subscription from a file or package for\
    \ which you\n         have an FUI. The filename and filetype parameters identify\
    \ a\n         file or package to which you want to delete an FUI. The\n      \
    \   filelist option allows you to specify the name of the filelist\n         in\
    \ which it is located. If this is not specified in the\n         command, LISTSERV\
    \ will locate the filelist through a search of\n         its own internal filelist\
    \ index.\n      List\n         The List option shows the files or packages for\
    \ which you\n         currently have an FUI subscription at a LISTSERV server.\n\

    \      The PW command enables you to add, change or delete a personal\n      password\
    \ on any LISTSERV server. A personal password is designed\n      to give you added\
    \ command security on a LISTSERV since it helps\n      prevent impostors using\
    \ your e-mail address. The use of personal\n      passwords is strongly encouraged\
    \ for this reason. Every server\n      will accept a password registration request\
    \ from you at any time.\n      Passwords are comprised of one to eight alphanumeric\
    \ characters.\n      You may change or delete your password at any time. The options\n\
    \      parameter must be one of the following:\n      ADD  new-password\n    \
    \     Add a new personal password on the LISTSERV processing your\n         command.\
    \  Once you have registered a password on a LISTSERV\n         server, you will\
    \ be obliged to use the PW= command keyword in\n         the commands where it\
    \ appears as an option.\n      CHange  old-password  new-password\n         Change\
    \ your personal password on a LISTSERV server where you\n         already have\

    \ a LISTSERV where you already\n         have one. Once you have removed a password\
    \ from a LISTSERV\n         server, you will no longer be obliged to use the PW=\
    \ command\n         keyword in the commands where it appears as an option.\n \
    \  11.4.3. LISTSERV DATABASE Functions\n      LISTSERV provides the facility for\
    \ users to retrieve old mail that\n      has been distributed on mailing lists.\
    \ Each mailing list has an\n      associated database (called a notebook or list\
    \ archive database)\n      in which list mail is stored. Note that databases may\
    \ not be\n      maintained for every mailing list, this is done at the discretion\n\
    \      of a list owner. The notebook databases are the most commonly used\n  \
    \    of the LISTSERV databases. However, every LISTSERV server also has\n    \
    \  a database of all the EARN/Bitnet computer nodes (called the\n      BITEARN\
    \ database). This is available to all LISTSERV users. The\n      backbone LISTSERV\
    \ servers also have a database of all the LISTSERV\n      computer nodes (called\
    \ the PEERS database). In addition to these\n      databases, a LISTSERV server\
    \ may have any number of different\n      databases that have been created locally.\
    \ To find out what\n      databases are accessible at a particular LISTSERV site,\
    \ send\n      following command to that server:\n                DATABASE LIST\n\
    \      To perform a database search, you can send mail to LISTSERV\n      containing\
    \ a batch database job which contains your database\n      query. In addition,\
    \ EARN/Bitnet users on VM or VMS systems can\n      access the database facilities\
    \ interactively via the LDBASE\n      program. For more details on the LISTSERV\
    \ database facilities,\n      send an Info DATABASE command to your nearest (or\
    \ any) LISTSERV\n      server (see the section Commands for INFORMATION) or consult\
    \ the\n      LISTSERV DATABASE Functions chapter in the LISTSERV User Guide.\n\
    \   11.4.4. Commands for INFORMATION:\n      The LISTSERV server can provide a\
    \ diverse range of information to\n      the general user. This includes help\
    \ files, release levels of the\n      server and important configuration files,\
    \ statistics and\n      information pertaining to the EARN/Bitnet network. When\
    \ sending\n      these commands to LISTSERV, they must be addressed to the server\n\
    \      and not to any mailing lists it may manage. For those commands\n      that\
    \ result in files being sent to the requestor (for example the\n      Info command),\
    \ the format of the file can be specified by the\n      optional command keyword\
    \ F= in the command text (see the section\n      LISTSERV Command Keywords for\
    \ more information).\n      +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\

- title: 12.1. What is NETNEWS
  contents:
  - "12.1. What is NETNEWS\n   Netnews, or Usenet as it is more commonly called, is\
    \ a message\n   sharing system that exchanges messages electronically around the\n\
    \   world in a standard format. Messages exchanged on Usenet are arranged\n  \
    \ by topic into categories called newsgroups. Netnews is, thus, a huge\n   collection\
    \ of messages, being passed from machine to machine. The\n   messages may contain\
    \ both plain text and encoded binary information.\n   The messages also contain\
    \ header lines that define who the message\n   came from, when the message was\
    \ posted, where it was posted, where it\n   has passed, and other administrative\
    \ information.\n   The major, hierarchical categories of Usenet newsgroups which\
    \ are\n   distributed throughout the world are alt, comp, misc, news, rec, sci,\n\
    \   soc, and talk. There are many other major categories which may be\n   topical\
    \ (e.g., bionet, biz, vmsnet) and are usually distributed\n   worldwide as well,\
    \ or geographical and even organizational (e.g.,\n   ieee) or commercial (e.g.,\
    \ clari). The latter categories are usually\n   distributed only with their area\
    \ of interest. The messages of many\n   Bitnet LISTSERV mailing lists are also\
    \ distributed in Usenet under\n   the major category bit.\n   The major categories\
    \ are further broken down into more than 1200\n   newsgroups on different subjects\
    \ which range from education for the\n   disabled to Star Trek and from environmental\
    \ science to politics in\n   the former Soviet Union. The quality of the discussion\
    \ in newsgroups\n   is not guaranteed to be high. Some newsgroups have a moderator\
    \ who\n   scans the messages for the group before they are distributed and\n \
    \  decides which ones are appropriate for distribution.\n   Usenet was originally\
    \ developed for Unix systems in 1979. Within a\n   year, fifty Unix sites were\
    \ participating. Now, there are thousands\n   of sites running a number of operating\
    \ systems on a variety of\n   hardware platforms communicating via Usenet around\
    \ the globe.\n"
- title: 12.2. Who can use NETNEWS
  contents:
  - "12.2. Who can use NETNEWS\n   Usenet newsgroups can be read at thousands of sites\
    \ around the world.\n   In addition, there are several sites that provide public\
    \ dial-up\n   service so that people who are not at a Usenet site can have access\n\
    \   to newsgroups as well. If you don't know if your site has Usenet\n   access,\
    \ check with your local computer support people.\n   Protocols and software for\
    \ the distribution of news are in use in\n   several networks, such as the Internet,\
    \ UUCP, EARN/Bitnet and\n   Fidonet.\n   If you have e-mail service only, then\
    \ you can not access Usenet.\n   However, many newsgroups are connected to mailing\
    \ lists which you\n   could join. For a list of these newsgroups and their associated\n\
    \   mailing lists, send mail to LISTSERV@AMERICAN.EDU with the line: GET\n   NETGATE\
    \ GATELIST.  Moreover, many of the documents which appear\n   periodically in\
    \ newsgroups are available by e-mail from\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu. For instructions,\

    \ either access\n   a local news spool, or use the Network News Transfer Protocol\
    \ (NNTP)\n   to access the news spool on some other computer in the network.\n\
    \   Within EARN, a network of Netnews distribution has been developed,\n   providing\
    \ efficient distribution of Usenet traffic while minimizing\n   the load on the\
    \ network for the participating countries.\n   If Usenet is not available to you\

    \   database servers. This provides an easy-to-use uniform access method\n   to\
    \ a large number of databases.\n   ASTRA provides the same user interface for\
    \ all databases it can\n   access, even if the database servers have different\
    \ access languages,\n   such as STAIRS, ISIS or SQL.\n   Each database defined\

    \ of the database\n   and its language. Users are advised to look at the abstracts\

  - "13.2.1 What is NETSERV\n   NETSERV is a server, which allows fast access to data\
    \ files and\n   programs of interest to the EARN/Bitnet community. NETSERV provides\
    \ a\n   file repository consisting of information files and programs. It\n   allows\
    \ users to retrieve files, to store files and to subscribe to\n   the files of\
    \ their choice. The latter two functions however, require\n   that the user have\
    \ a password for NETSERV (this is called a\n   privileged user).\n   In order\
    \ to achieve a balanced load on the network and a faster\n   response time to\
    \ users, NETSERV uses a distributed server concept:\n   this is achieved by the\
    \ installation of a large number of servers on\n   the network to ensure that\
    \ the user can locate a nearby server. All\n   servers communicate with each other\
    \ to distribute updated information\n   and make it available from each copy of\
    \ the server.\n   NETSERV's file server functions include retrieving any file\
    \ present\n   in its filelists, storing new versions of a file, and subscribing\
    \ to\n   files stored on the server. Its file directories are arranged in an\n\
    \   hierarchical method, with NETSERV FILELIST being on top or at the\n   root\
    \ of the filelists. This filelist can be obtained by sending a GET\n   NETSERV\
    \ FILELIST command to any NETSERV. Filelists contain short\n   descriptions of\
    \ the files, and two access codes for each file. These\n   codes represent the\
    \ get and put privileges required for that file.\n   These codes are explained\

  contents:
  - "13.4.1. What is PROSPERO\n   PROSPERO is a distributed file system. It differs\
    \ from traditional\n   distributed file systems in several ways. In traditional\
    \ file\n   systems, the mapping of names to files is the same for all users.\n\
    \   Prospero supports user centered naming: users construct customized\n   views\
    \ of the files that are accessible. A virtual system defines this\n   view and\
    \ controls the mapping from names to files. Objects may be\n   organized in multiple\
    \ ways and the same object may appear in\n   different virtual systems, or even\
    \ with multiple names in the same\n   virtual system.\n   In Prospero, the global\
    \ file system consists of a collection of\n   virtual file systems. Virtual file\
    \ systems usually start as a copy of\n   a prototype. The root contains links\
    \ to files or directories selected\n   by the user.\n   The Prospero file system\
    \ provides tools that make it easier to keep\n   track of and organize information\
    \ in large systems. When first\n   created, your virtual file system is likely\
    \ to contain links to\n   directories that organize information in different ways.\
    \ As the\n   master copy of each of these directories is updated, you will see\
    \ the\n   changes. You may customize these directories. The changes you make to\n\
    \   a customized directory are only seen from within your own virtual\n   system,\
    \ but changes made to the master copy will also be visible to\n   you.\n   Users\
    \ are encouraged to organize their own projects and papers in a\n   manner that\
    \ will allow them to be easily added to the master\n   directory.  For example,\
    \ users should consider creating a virtual\n   directory that contains pointers\
    \ to copies of each of the papers that\n   they want made available to the outside\
    \ world. This virtual directory\n   may appear anywhere in the user's virtual\
    \ system. Once set up, a link\n   may be added to the master author directory.\
    \ In this manner, others\n   will be able to find this directory. Once added to\
    \ the master\n   directory, any future changes will be immediately available to\
    \ other\n   users.\n"

    \   2 users to talk at once, with access throughout the global Internet.\n   It\
    \ also provides many other useful features.\n   IRC is networked over much of\
    \ North America, Europe, and Asia. When\n   you are talking in IRC, everything\
    \ you type will instantly be\n   transmitted around the world to other users who\
    \ are connected at the\n   time. They can then type something and respond to your\
    \ messages.\n   Topics of discussion on IRC are varied. Technical and political\n\
    \   discussions are popular, especially when world events are in\n   progress.\
    \  IRC is also a way to expand your horizons, as people from\n   many countries\

    \  RELAY is available to users on the EARN/Bitnet network via\n   interactive\
    \ message (e.g., the TELL command of VM or the SEND command\n   of VMS/JNET).\
    \  All RELAY server machines are on IBM VM/CMS systems,\n   but you do not have\
    \ to be a VM user in order to use RELAY. If you are\n   not in the EARN/Bitnet\
    \ network, you can not use RELAY.\n   CHAT, a full-screen interface to send and\
    \ receive TELL messages for\n   VM systems, is particularly useful for users of\
    \ RELAY. CHAT is\n   available from any NETSERV.\n"
