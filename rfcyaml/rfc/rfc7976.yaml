  contents:
  - "2.1.  General\n   RFC 7315 contains contradicting statements regarding the usage\
    \ of SIP\n   \"P-\" header fields in SIP requests and responses, which leave the\n\
    \   presence of the SIP \"P-\" header fields in the SIP requests and\n   responses\
    \ open to interpretation and different implementations.\n   Statements in Section\
    \ 5.7 of that RFC are not aligned with the\n   definitions and usage of the SIP\
    \ \"P-\" header fields specified in\n   Section 4.  This section describes the\
    \ misalignments that occurred\n   when RFC 3455 was updated and obsoleted by RFC\
    \ 7315, and how they are\n   fixed.\n   NOTE: In the case of the P-Called-Party-ID\
    \ header field, allowing it\n   in PUBLISH requests was deliberately done in RFC\
    \ 7315.  Therefore, it\n   is not considered a misalignment.\n   Since RFC 7315\
    \ was published, 3GPP defined new use cases that require\n   the RFC to be updated.\
    \  This section describes the 3GPP use cases\n   behind the updates, and the updates\
    \ needed to RFC 7315 in order to\n   support the use cases.\n   Section 3 updates\
    \ RFC 7315, based on the misalignments and 3GPP use\n   cases.\n"

    \ the statement that the header field can\n      appear in the SIP REGISTER method.\n\

  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  P-Access-Network-Info\n   The P-Access-Network-Info header field may\
    \ contain the Network\n   Provided Location Information (NPLI).  The NPLI is described\
    \ in\n   [TS.3GPP.23.228].\n   A proxy in possession of appropriate information\
    \ about the access\n   technology might insert a P-Access-Network-Info header\
    \ field with its\n   own values.  Such values are identified by the string \"\
    network-\n   provided\" defined in RFC 7315.  Based on operator policy and/or\n\
    \   roaming agreement, the local time of the visited network may be\n   included.\n\
    \   The Call Data Records (CDRs) generated within the IP Multimedia\n   Subsystem\
    \ (IMS) have to contain the NPLI in order to guarantee\n   correct billing.  When\
    \ an IMS session is modified, the NPLI also\n   needs to be stored as the location\
    \ of the user at the time when the\n   session is modified may generate a charging\
    \ event.  In case of a\n   session modification event at IMS, the NPLI needs to\
    \ be provided:\n   o  when the bearer establishment is triggered, or\n   o  at\
    \ session release when the bearer deactivation is triggered, or\n   o  when the\
    \ bearer modification is triggered, e.g., a QoS\n      modification for the use\
    \ of a newly negotiated codec.\n   In some scenarios, the bearer modification\
    \ may be triggered by the\n   proxy upon reception of a Session Description Protocol\
    \ (SDP) answer\n   within SIP 2xx response to the SIP INVITE request.  In such\
    \ case, the\n   NPLI needs to be provided within the SIP ACK request.  However,\
    \ RFC\n   7315 does not allow the usage of the P-Access-Network-Info header\n\
    \   field in SIP ACK request.\n   Upon reception of the SDP answer within SIP\
    \ 2xx response on the SIP\n   INVITE request, a proxy may initiate procedures\
    \ to obtain the NPLI\n   and may include the P-Access-Network-Info header field\
    \ with the NPLI\n   in the SIP ACK request.\n   The P-Access-Network-Info header\
    \ field shall not be included in SIP\n   ACK requests triggered by non-2xx responses.\n"
- title: 2.3.3.  P-Charging-Vector
  contents:
  - "2.3.3.  P-Charging-Vector\n   RFC 7315 defines an Inter Operator Identifier (IOI)\
    \ to enable\n   different operators involved in a SIP dialog or a transaction\
    \ outside\n   a dialog to identify each other by exchanging operator identification\n\
    \   information within the P-Charging-Vector header field.\n   In the interconnection\
    \ scenarios in multi-operator environments,\n   where one or more transit operators\
    \ are between the originating and\n   terminating operator, the identities of\
    \ the involved transit\n   operators are represented by a transit-ioi parameter\
    \ of the\n   P-Charging-Vector header field.\n   Transit operators can be selected\
    \ independently for each SIP method\n   and direction of request.  A transit network\
    \ will only have knowledge\n   of an individual SIP request, and transit network\
    \ selection will be\n   an independent decision for each request and could be\
    \ made based on\n   load, cost, percentage, time of day, and other factors.  For\
    \ this\n   reason, it is necessary that the P-Charging-Vector header field,\n\
    \   which carries the transit IOI information, is included in each SIP\n   request\
    \ and response.  However, RFC 7315 does not allow the usage of\n   the P-Charging-Vector\
    \ header field in the SIP ACK request.\n   A SIP proxy that supports this extension\
    \ and receives the SIP ACK\n   request may include a P-Charging-Vector header\
    \ field in the SIP ACK\n   request.\n   The P-Charging-Vector header field shall\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations for these \"P-\"\
    \ header fields are defined\n   in [RFC7315].  This specification allows some\
    \ header fields to be\n   present in messages where they were previously not allowed,\
    \ and the\n   security considerations and assumptions described in [RFC7315] (e.g.,\n\
    \   regarding only sending information to trusted entities) also apply to\n  \
    \ those messages.  In addition, this specification also disallows some\n   header\
    \ fields to be present in messages where they were previously\n   allowed.  That\
    \ does not cause any security issues, but implementors\n   need to be aware that\
    \ implementations may not have been updated\n   according to this document, and\
    \ take proper actions if a header field\n   occurs, or does not occur, in a message\
    \ where it should occur (or\n   occurs in a message where it should not occur).\
    \  This document adds\n   the ability to include P-Access-Network-Info in ACK\
    \ requests.  As\n   documented in [RFC7315], P-Access-Network-Info may include\
    \ privacy\n   sensitive information, including the user's location.  The security\n\
    \   and privacy considerations for P-Access-Network-Info in ACK requests\n   are\
    \ similar to those for the other SIP requests discussed in\n   [RFC7315].\n"
