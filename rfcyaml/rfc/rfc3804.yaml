  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document lists the various VPIM email address formats
    that are\n   currently in common use and defines several new address formats for\n
    \  special case usage.   Requirements are imposed on the formats of\n   addresses
    used in VPIM submission mode\n   [VPIM2] does not place any restrictions on the
    email address format.\n   However, it does recommend the use of a numeric LHS
    since many legacy\n   voice mail systems only use digits to identify mailboxes.
    \ Further,\n   it recommends a structure to handle private, international and\n
    \  extensions.  The private format has become deployed in most existing\n   VPIM
    v2 systems, further some systems will only accept messages from\n   addresses
    with a numeric LHS.\n   [IVM] does not describe addressing at all.  The LHS format
    is left to\n   the discretion of the mailbox owner.  However, it is useful in
    some\n   cases (like submission or tunneling) to specify a LHS format.  A\n   format
    based on GSTN addressing [GSTN] is presented.\n   This document defines the various
    recipient (i.e., TO) addresses for\n   VPIM and IVM messages.\n"

    \  most commonly used in VPIM v2 systems.\n           Example:  6137637582@nortelnetworks.com\n"
  title: 3.  VPIM v2 Addressing

  - "4.  VPIM Addressing\n   VPIM places no restrictions on the form of the Internet
    address.\n   VPIM systems must be capable of receiving an arbitrary email address\n
    \  and generating a reply to that address.  No inferences about the\n   structure
    of the local part (LHS) should be necessary.\n   Recipients email addresses must
    be created in a form compatible with\n   the recipients system and consistent
    with the address entry\n   capabilities of a telephone user interface.\n   The
    following sections use formal syntax compliant with RFC 2234,\n   \"Augmented
    BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF\".\n"

    - "4.1.  VPIM Gateways\n   A gateway translates between dissimilar environments.
      \ For VPIM, a\n   gateway connects between the VPIM profile of Internet mail
      and other\n   voice mail networking protocols (including voice call answer and\n
      \  delivery).  These may be proprietary or standard (like AMIS [AMIS-\n   A]).
      \ VPIM gateways typically service multiple voice mail users or,\n   in the case
      of call answer, service only one.  In the former case,\n   they serve as a classic
      \"mail transfer agent\" (MTA) and in the latter\n   as a classic \"mail user
      agent\" (UA).\n   An onramp is a gateway which connects from another voice mail\n
      \  networking protocol to VPIM.  An offramp is a gateway which connects\n   from
      VPIM to another voice mail networking protocol.  Behavior of\n   onramps and
      offramps is out of scope for this specification.\n   This specification describes
      the VPIM service portion of onramp and\n   offramp addressing.\n"

    - "4.2.  VPIM Submission LHS\n   Limited capability voice mail machines may send
      messages by default\n   to an external message submission gateway.  These gateways
      will\n   convert the unresolved telephone number of the recipient into a\n   legitimate
      email address.  Messages requiring address resolution must\n   be sent to a
      submission system which will convert the submitted\n   address into the route-able
      email address.\n   Additionally, limited capability email systems may send messages
      to a\n   VPIM onramp system indicated on the RHS.  The LHS would indicate that\n
      \  the message is to be sent as a VPIM message to the telephone number\n   indicated.
      \ In this case, address and message translation is\n   performed by the gateway.\n
      \  Telephone numbers sent in a VPIM submission mode MUST be sent in one\n   of
      the following forms.\n   This is based on the format defined in [GSTN-ADDR]
      and extensions in\n   [GSTN].\n"
