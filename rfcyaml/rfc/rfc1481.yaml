  contents:
  - "Recommendation\n   Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) proposes strategies\
    \ for address\n   assignment of the existing IP address space with a view to conserve\n\
    \   the address space and stem the explosive growth of routing tables in\n   default-route-free\
    \ routers run by transit routing domain providers\n   [1].  CIDR is proposed as\
    \ an immediate term strategy to extend the\n   life of the current 32 bit IP address\
    \ space.  This strategy presumes\n   that a suitable long term solution is being\
    \ addressed within the\n   Internet technical community.\n   The basic components\
    \ of the CIDR plan are: management of the\n   allocation of Internet address space\
    \ and provision of a mechanism for\n   aggregation of routing information.  The\
    \ IP community has published\n   several RFCs and Internet-Drafts which describe\
    \ the architecture for\n   IP address assignment and routing protocols which will\
    \ promote the\n   deployment of CIDR.  These documents have led to changes in\
    \ the way\n   network address are allocated and have prompted enhancements to\
    \ the\n   inter-domain and intra-domain routing protocols.\n   With the CIDR prompted\
    \ changes in the management of the allocation of\n   the Internet address space,\
    \ allocation of blocks of Class C numbers\n   leads to an explosion of the routing\
    \ tables.  So, it is important\n   that the techniques for aggregating information\
    \ in the routing\n   protocols keep pace with the change in the allocation of\
    \ IP numbers.\n   The IAB endorses the CIDR architecture and its implementation.\
    \  In\n   addition, the IAB supports the actions taken by the IANA and\n   InterNIC,\
    \ the router vendors, and the network operators to implement\n   CIDR to address\
    \ the scaling problem that we are facing with the\n   growth of the Internet.\n"
