    - "1.1.  Overview\n   The SIGTRAN protocols are designed to carry signaling messages
      for\n   telephony services.  These protocols will be used between\n   o  customer
      premise and service provider equipment in case of ISDN\n      Q.921 User Adaptation
      Layer (IUA) [9].\n   o  service provider equipment only.  This is the case for
      SS7 MTP2\n      User Adaptation Layer (M2UA) [12], SS7 MTP2 Peer-to-Peer User\n
      \     Adaptation Layer (M2PA) [15], SS7 MTP3 User Adaptation Layer\n      (M3UA)
      [13] and SS7 SCCP User Adaptation Layer (SUA) [16].  The\n      carriers may
      be different and may use other transport network\n      providers.\n   The security
      requirements for these situations may be different.\n   SIGTRAN protocols involve
      the security needs of several parties, the\n   end-users of the services, the
      service providers and the applications\n   involved.  Additional security requirements
      may come from local\n   regulation.  While having some overlapping security
      needs, any\n   security solution should fulfill all of the different parties'
      needs.\n   The SIGTRAN protocols assume that messages are secured by using\n
      \  either IPsec or TLS.\n"

  - "3.  Security in Telephony Networks\n   The security in telephony networks is
    mainly based on the closed\n   network principle.  There are two main protocols
    used: Access\n   protocols (ISDN and others) are used for signaling in the access\n
    \  network and the SS7 protocol stack in the core network.\n   As SS7 networks
    are often physically remote and/or inaccessible to\n   the user, it is assumed
    that they are protected from malicious users.\n   Equipment is often under lock
    and key.  At network boundaries between\n   SS7 networks, packet filtering is
    sometimes used.  End-users are not\n   directly connected to SS7 networks.\n   The
    access protocols are used for end-user signaling.  End-user\n   signaling protocols
    are translated to SS7 based protocols by\n   telephone switches run by network
    operators.\n   Regulatory Authorities often require SS7 switches with connections
    to\n   different SS7 switches to be conformant to national and/or\n   international
    test specifications.\n   There are no standardized ways of using encryption technologies
    for\n   providing confidentiality or using technologies for authentication.\n
    \  This description applies to telephony networks operated by a single\n   operator,
    and also to multiple telephony networks being connected and\n   operated by different
    operators.\n"

  - "4.  Threats and Goals\n   The Internet threats can be divided into one of two
    main types.  The\n   first one is called \"passive attacks\".  It happens whenever
    the\n   attacker reads packets off the network but does not write them.\n   Examples
    of such attacks include confidentiality violations, password\n   sniffing and
    offline cryptographic attacks amongst others.\n   The second kind of threat is
    called \"active attacks\".  In this case,\n   the attacker also writes data to
    the network.  Examples for this\n   attack include replay attacks, message insertion,
    message deletion,\n   message modification or man-in-the-middle attacks, amongst
    others.\n   In general, Internet protocols have the following security\n   objectives:\n
    \  o  Communication Security:\n      *  Authentication of peers\n      *  Integrity
    of user data transport\n      *  Confidentiality of user data\n      *  Replay
    protection\n   o  Non-repudiation\n   o  System Security, avoidance of:\n      *
    \ Unauthorized use\n      *  Inappropriate use\n      *  Denial of Service\n   Communication
    security is mandatory in some network scenarios to\n   prevent malicious attacks.
    \ The main goal of this document is to\n   recommend the minimum security means
    that a SIGTRAN node must\n   implement in order to attain secured communication.
    \ To achieve this\n   goal, we will explore the different existing security options\n
    \  regarding communication.\n   All SIGTRAN protocols use the Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol\n   (SCTP) defined in [8] and [11] as its transport protocol.  SCTP\n
    \  provides certain transport related security features, such as\n   resistance
    against:\n   o  Blind Denial of Service Attacks such as:\n      *  Flooding.\n
    \     *  Masquerade.\n      *  Improper Monopolization of Services.\n   There
    is no quick fix, one-size-fits-all solution for security.\n   When a network using
    SIGTRAN protocols involves more than one party,\n   it may not be reasonable to
    expect that all parties have implemented\n   security in a sufficient manner.
    \ End-to-end security should be the\n   goal; therefore, it is recommended that
    IPsec or TLS be used to\n   ensure confidentiality of user payload.  Consult [3]
    for more\n   information on configuring IPsec services.\n"
  title: 4.  Threats and Goals
- contents:
  - "5.  IPsec Usage\n   This section is only relevant for SIGTRAN nodes using IPsec
    to secure\n   communication between SIGTRAN nodes.\n   All SIGTRAN nodes using
    IPsec MUST implement IPsec ESP [4] in\n   transport mode with non-null encryption
    and authentication algorithms\n   to provide per-packet authentication, integrity
    protection and\n   confidentiality, and MUST implement the replay protection mechanisms\n
    \  of IPsec.  In those scenarios where IP layer protection is needed,\n   ESP
    in tunnel mode SHOULD be used.  Non-null encryption should be\n   used when using
    IPSec ESP.\n   All SIGTRAN nodes MUST support IKE for peer authentication,\n   negotiation
    of security associations, and key management, using the\n   IPsec DOI [5].  The
    IPsec implementations MUST support peer\n   authentication using a pre-shared
    key, and MAY support certificate-\n   based peer authentication using digital
    signatures.  Peer\n   authentication using the public key encryption methods outlined
    in\n   IKE's sections 5.2 and 5.3 [6] SHOULD NOT be used.\n   Conformant implementations
    MUST support IKEs Main Mode and Aggressive\n   Mode.  For transport mode, when
    pre-shared keys are used for\n   authentication, IKE Aggressive Mode SHOULD be
    used, and IKE Main Mode\n   SHOULD NOT be used.  When digital signatures are used
    for\n   authentication, either IKE Main Mode or IKE Aggressive Mode MAY be\n   used.
    \ When using ESP tunnel mode, IKE Main Mode MAY be used to\n   create an ISAKMP
    association with identity protection during Phase 1.\n   When digital signatures
    are used to achieve authentication, an IKE\n   negotiator SHOULD use IKE Certificate
    Request Payload(s) to specify\n   the certification authority (or authorities)
    that is trusted in\n   accordance with its local policy.  IKE negotiators SHOULD
    use\n   pertinent certificate revocation checks before accepting a PKI\n   certificate
    for use in IKE's authentication procedures.  See [10] for\n   certificate revocation
    and [7] for online-checking.\n   The Phase 2 Quick Mode exchanges used to negotiate
    protection for\n   SIGTRAN sessions MUST explicitly carry the Identity Payload
    fields\n   (IDci and IDcr).  The DOI provides for several types of\n   identification
    data.  However, when used in conformant\n   implementations, each ID Payload MUST
    carry a single IP address and a\n   single non-zero port number, and MUST NOT
    use the IP Subnet or IP\n   Address Range formats.  This allows the Phase 2 security
    association\n   to correspond to specific TCP and SCTP connections.\n   Since
    IPsec acceleration hardware may only be able to handle a\n   limited number of
    active IKE Phase 2 SAs, Phase 2 delete messages may\n   be sent for idle SAs as
    a means of keeping the number of active Phase\n   2 SAs to a minimum.  The receipt
    of an IKE Phase 2 delete message\n   SHOULD NOT be interpreted as a reason for
    tearing down a SIGTRAN\n   session.  Rather, it is preferable to leave the connection
    up,\n   whereby another IKE Phase 2 SA will be brought up to protect it if\n   additional
    traffic is sent.  This avoids the potential of continually\n   bringing connections
    up and down.\n   It should be noted that SCTP supports multi-homed hosts and this\n
    \  results in the need for having multiple security associations for one\n   SCTP
    association. This disadvantage of IPsec has been addressed by\n   [17]. So IPsec
    implementations used by SIGTRAN nodes SHOULD support\n   the IPsec feature described
    in [17].\n"
  title: 5.  IPsec Usage
- contents:
  - "6.  TLS Usage\n   This section is only relevant for SIGTRAN nodes using TLS to
    secure\n   the communication between SIGTRAN nodes.\n   A SIGTRAN node that initiates
    a SCTP association to another SIGTRAN\n   node acts as a TLS client according
    to [2], and a SIGTRAN node that\n   accepts a connection acts as a TLS server.
    \ SIGTRAN peers\n   implementing TLS for security MUST mutually authenticate as
    part of\n   TLS session establishment.  In order to ensure mutual authentication,\n
    \  the SIGTRAN node acting as TLS server must request a certificate from\n   the
    SIGTRAN node acting as TLS client, and the SIGTRAN node acting as\n   TLS client
    MUST be prepared to supply a certificate on request.\n   [14] requires the support
    of the cipher suite\n   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.  SIGTRAN nodes MAY negotiate
    other TLS\n   cipher suites.\n   TLS MUST be used on all bi-directional streams.
    \ Other uni-\n   directional streams MUST NOT be used.\n   It should also be noted
    that a SCTP implementation used for TLS over\n   SCTP MUST support fragmentation
    of user data and might also need to\n   support the partial delivery API.  This
    holds even if all SIGTRAN\n   messages are small.  Furthermore, the 'unordered
    delivery' feature of\n   SCTP can not be used in conjunction with TLS.  See [14]
    for more\n   details.\n   Because TLS only protects the payload, the SCTP header
    and all\n   control chunks are not protected.  This can be used for DoS attacks.\n
    \  This is a general problem with security provided at the transport\n   layer.\n
    \  The SIGTRAN protocols use the same SCTP port number and payload\n   protocol
    identifier when run over TLS.  A session upgrade procedure\n   has to be used
    to initiate the TLS based communication.\n   The session upgrade procedure should
    be as follows:\n   o  If an ASP has been configured to use TLS, it sends a STARTTLS\n
    \     message on stream 0 and starts a timer T_TLS.  This is the first\n      message
    sent and the ASP sends no other adaptation layer messages\n      until the TLS
    based communication has been established.\n   o  If the peer does not support
    TLS, it sends back an ERROR message\n      indicating an unsupported message type.
    \ In this case, the SCTP\n      association is terminated and it is reported to
    the management\n      layer that the peer does not support TLS.\n   o  If the
    peer does support TLS, it sends back a STARTTLS_ACK\n      message.  The client
    then starts TLS based communication.\n   o  If T_TLS expires without getting any
    of the above answers, the\n      association is terminated and the failure is
    reported to the\n      management layer.\n   All SIGTRAN adaptation layers share
    a common message format.  The\n   STARTTLS message consists of a common header
    only using the message\n   class 10 and message type 1.  The STARTTLS_ACK message
    uses the same\n   message class 10 and the message type 2.  Neither messages contain\n
    \  any parameters.\n   Using this procedure, it is possible for a man-in-the-middle
    to do a\n   denial of service attack by indicating that the peer does not support\n
    \  TLS.  But this kind of attack is always possible for a man-in-the-\n   middle.\n"
  title: 6.  TLS Usage

  - "7.  Support of IPsec and TLS\n   If content of SIGTRAN protocol messages is to
    be protected, either\n   IPsec ESP or TLS can be used.  In both IPsec ESP Transport
    Mode and\n   TLS cases, the IP header information is neither encrypted nor\n   protected.
    \ If IPsec ESP is chosen, the SCTP control information is\n   encrypted and protected
    whereas in the TLS based solution, the SCTP\n   control information is not encrypted
    and only protected by SCTP\n   procedures.\n   In general, both IPsec and TLS
    have enough mechanisms to secure the\n   SIGTRAN communications.\n   Therefore,
    in order to have a secured model working as soon as\n   possible, the following
    recommendation is made: A SIGTRAN node MUST\n   support IPsec and MAY support
    TLS.\n"
  title: 7.  Support of IPsec and TLS
- contents:
  - "8.  Peer-to-Peer Considerations\n   M2PA, M3UA and SUA support the peer-to-peer
    model as a generalization\n   to the client-server model which is supported by
    IUA and M2UA.  A\n   SIGTRAN node running M2PA, M3UA or SUA and operating in the
    peer-to-\n   peer mode is called a SIGTRAN peer.\n   As with any peer-to-peer
    protocol, proper configuration of the trust\n   model within a peer is essential
    to security.  When certificates are\n   used, it is necessary to configure the
    trust anchors trusted by the\n   peer.  These trust anchors are likely to be unique
    to SIGTRAN usage\n   and distinct from the trust anchors that might be trusted
    for other\n   purposes such as Web browsing.  In general, it is expected that
    those\n   trust anchors will be configured so as to reflect the business\n   relationships
    between the organization hosting the peer and other\n   organizations.  As a result,
    a peer will not typically be configured\n   to allow connectivity with any arbitrary
    peer.  When certificate\n   authentication peers may not be known beforehand,
    peer discovery may\n   be required.\n   Note that IPsec is considerably less flexible
    than TLS when it comes\n   to configuring trust anchors.  Since use of Port identifiers
    is\n   prohibited within IKE Phase 1, it is not possible to uniquely\n   configure
    trusted trust anchors for each application individually\n   within IPsec; the
    same policy must be used for all applications.\n   This implies, for example,
    that a trust anchor trusted for use with a\n   SIGTRAN protocol must also be trusted
    to protect other protocols (for\n   example SNMP).  These restrictions are awkward
    at best.\n   When pre-shared key authentication is used with IPsec to protect\n
    \  SIGTRAN based communication, unique pre-shared keys are configured\n   with
    peers that are identified by their IP address (Main Mode), or\n   possibly their
    FQDN (AggressivenMode).  As a result, it is necessary\n   for the set of peers
    to be known beforehand.  Therefore, peer\n   discovery is typically not necessary.\n
    \  The following is intended to provide some guidance on the issue.\n   It is
    recommended that SIGTRAN peers use the same security mechanism\n   (IPsec or TLS)
    across all its sessions with other SIGTRAN peers.\n   Inconsistent use of security
    mechanisms can result in redundant\n   security mechanisms being used (e.g., TLS
    over IPsec) or worse,\n   potential security vulnerabilities.  When IPsec is used
    with a\n   SIGTRAN protocol, a typical security policy for outbound traffic is\n
    \  \"Initiate IPsec, from me to any, destination port P\"; for inbound\n   traffic,
    the policy would be \"Require IPsec, from any to me,\n   destination port P\".
    \ Here, P denotes one of the registered port\n   numbers for a SIGTRAN protocol.\n
    \  This policy causes IPsec to be used whenever a SIGTRAN peer initiates\n   a
    session to another SIGTRAN peer, and to be required whenever an\n   inbound SIGTRAN
    session occurs.  This policy is attractive, since it\n   does not require policy
    to be set for each peer or dynamically\n   modified each time a new SIGTRAN session
    is created; an IPsec SA is\n   automatically created based on a simple static
    policy.  Since IPsec\n   extensions are typically not available to the sockets
    API on most\n   platforms, and IPsec policy functionality is implementation\n
    \  dependent, use of a simple static policy is the often the simplest\n   route
    to IPsec-enabling a SIGTRAN peer.\n   If IPsec is used to secure a SIGTRAN peer-to-peer
    session, IPsec\n   policy SHOULD be set so as to require IPsec protection for
    inbound\n   connections, and to initiate IPsec protection for outbound\n   connections.
    \ This can be accomplished via use of inbound and\n   outbound filter policy.\n"
