- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) protocol element and\
    \ generic\n   syntax is defined by [RFC3986].  Each URI begins with a scheme name,\n\
    \   as defined by Section 3.1 of RFC 3986, that refers to a specification\n  \
    \ for identifiers within that scheme.  The URI syntax provides a\n   federated\
    \ and extensible naming system, where each scheme's\n   specification can further\
    \ restrict the syntax and define the\n   semantics of identifiers using that scheme.\n\
    \   This document obsoletes [RFC4395], which in turn obsoleted [RFC2717]\n   and\
    \ [RFC2718].  Recent documents have used the term \"URI\" for all\n   resource\
    \ identifiers, avoiding the term \"URL\" and reserving the term\n   \"URN\" explicitly\
    \ for those URIs using the \"urn\" scheme name\n   [RFC2141].  URN \"namespaces\"\
    \ [RFC3406] are specific to the \"urn\"\n   scheme and are not covered explicitly\
    \ by this specification.\n   This document provides updated guidelines for the\
    \ definition of new\n   schemes, for consideration by those who are defining,\
    \ registering, or\n   evaluating those definitions.  In addition, this document\
    \ provides an\n   updated process and mechanism for registering schemes within\
    \ the IANA\n   URI Schemes registry.  There is a single namespace for registered\n\
    \   schemes.  The intent of the registry is to:\n   o  provide a central point\
    \ of discovery for established URI scheme\n      names and easy location of defining\
    \ documents for schemes;\n   o  discourage multiple separate uses of the same\
    \ scheme name;\n   o  help those proposing new scheme names to discern established\n\
    \      trends and conventions and to avoid names that might be confused\n    \
    \  with existing ones; and\n   o  encourage registration by setting a low barrier\
    \ for registration.\n"
- title: 1.1.  URIs and IRIs
  contents:
  - "1.1.  URIs and IRIs\n   As originally defined, URIs only allowed a limited repertoire\
    \ of\n   characters chosen from US-ASCII.  An Internationalized Resource\n   Identifier\
    \ (IRI), as defined by [RFC3987], extends the URI syntax to\n   allow characters\
    \ from a much greater repertoire to accommodate\n   resource identifiers from\
    \ the world's languages.  RFC 3987 [RFC3987]\n   also defined a mapping between\
    \ URIs and IRIs.  IRIs use the same\n   scheme names as URIs.  Thus, there is\
    \ no separate independent\n   registry or registration process for IRI schemes:\
    \ the URI Schemes\n   registry is used for both URIs and IRIs.  Those who wish\
    \ to describe\n   resource identifiers that are useful as IRIs should define the\n\
    \   corresponding URI syntax and note that the IRI usage follows the\n   rules\
    \ and transformations defined in [RFC3987].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\
    \   This document distinguishes between a \"scheme specification\", which\n  \
    \ is a document defining the syntax and semantics of a scheme, and a\n   \"scheme\
    \ registration request\", which is the completed template\n   submitted to IANA.\
    \  The term \"scheme definition\" refers generically\n   to the syntax and semantics\
    \ of a scheme and is typically documented\n   in a scheme specification.\n"
- title: 3.  Requirements for Permanent Scheme Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements for Permanent Scheme Definitions\n   This section gives considerations\
    \ for new schemes.  Meeting these\n   guidelines is REQUIRED for 'permanent' scheme\
    \ registration.\n   'Permanent' status is appropriate for, but not limited to,\
    \ use in\n   standards.  For URI schemes defined or normatively referenced by\
    \ IETF\n   Standards Track documents, 'permanent' registration status is\n   REQUIRED.\n\
    \   [RFC3986] defines the overall syntax for URIs as:\n               URI = scheme\
    \ \":\" hier-part [ \"?\" query ] [ \"#\" fragment ]\n   A scheme definition cannot\
    \ override the overall syntax for URIs.  For\n   example, this means that fragment\
    \ identifiers cannot be reused\n   outside the generic syntax restrictions and\
    \ that fragment identifiers\n   are not scheme specific.  A scheme definition\
    \ must specify the scheme\n   name and the syntax of the scheme-specific part,\
    \ which is clarified\n   as follows:\n                 URI = scheme \":\" scheme-specific-part\
    \ [ \"#\" fragment ]\n                 scheme-specific-part = hier-part [ \"?\"\
    \ query ]\n"
- title: 3.1.  Demonstrable, New, Long-Lived Utility
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Demonstrable, New, Long-Lived Utility\n   In general, the use and deployment\
    \ of new schemes in the Internet\n   infrastructure can be costly; some parts\
    \ of URI processing are often\n   scheme dependent.  Introducing a new scheme\
    \ might require additional\n   software not only for client software and user\
    \ agents but also in\n   additional parts of the network infrastructure (gateways,\
    \ proxies,\n   caches) [W3CWebArch].  Since scheme names share a single, global\n\
    \   namespace, it is desirable to avoid contention over use of short,\n   mnemonic\
    \ scheme names.  New schemes ought to have utility to the\n   Internet community\
    \ beyond that available with already registered\n   schemes.  The scheme specification\
    \ SHOULD discuss the utility of the\n   scheme being registered.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Syntactic Compatibility
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Syntactic Compatibility\n   [RFC3986] defines the generic syntax for all\
    \ URI schemes, along with\n   the syntax of common URI components that are used\
    \ by many URI schemes\n   to define hierarchical identifiers.  [RFC3987] extended\
    \ this generic\n   syntax to cover IRIs.  All scheme specifications MUST define\
    \ their\n   own URI <scheme-specific-part> syntax.  Care must be taken to ensure\n\
    \   that all strings matching their scheme-specific syntax will also\n   match\
    \ the <absolute-URI> grammar described in [RFC3986].\n   New schemes SHOULD reuse\
    \ the common URI components of [RFC3986] for\n   the definition of hierarchical\
    \ naming schemes.  If there is a strong\n   reason for a scheme not to use the\
    \ hierarchical syntax, then the new\n   scheme definition SHOULD follow the syntax\
    \ of similar previously\n   registered schemes.\n   Schemes that are not intended\
    \ for use with relative URIs SHOULD avoid\n   use of the forward slash \"/\" character\
    \ in order to avoid unintended\n   processing, such as resolution of \".\" and\
    \ \"..\" (dot segments).\n   Schemes SHOULD avoid improper use of \"//\".  The\
    \ use of double slashes\n   in the first part of a URI is not a stylistic indicator\
    \ that what\n   follows is a URI: double slashes are intended for use ONLY when\
    \ the\n   syntax of the <scheme-specific-part> contains a hierarchical\n   structure.\
    \  In URIs from such schemes, the use of double slashes\n   indicates that what\
    \ follows is the top hierarchical element for a\n   naming authority (Section\
    \ 3.2 of RFC 3986 has more details).  Schemes\n   that do not contain a conformant\
    \ hierarchical structure in their\n   <scheme-specific-part> SHOULD NOT use double\
    \ slashes following the\n   \"<scheme>:\" string.\n   New schemes SHOULD clearly\
    \ define the role of reserved characters\n   (see Section 2.2 of [RFC3986]) in\
    \ URIs of the scheme being defined.\n   The syntax of the new scheme should be\
    \ clear about which of the\n   \"reserved\" set of characters are used as delimiters\
    \ within the URIs\n   of the new scheme, and when those characters must be escaped,\
    \ versus\n   when they can be used without escaping.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Well Defined
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Well Defined\n   While URIs might or might not be defined as locators in\
    \ practice, a\n   scheme definition itself MUST be clear as to how it is expected\
    \ to\n   function.  Schemes that are not intended to be used as locators\n   SHOULD\
    \ describe how the resource identified can be determined or\n   accessed by software\
    \ that obtains a URI of that scheme.\n   For schemes that function as locators,\
    \ it is important that the\n   mechanism of resource location be clearly defined.\
    \  This might mean\n   different things depending on the nature of the scheme.\n\
    \   In many cases, new schemes are defined as ways to translate between\n   other\
    \ namespaces or protocols and the general framework of URIs.  For\n   example,\
    \ the \"ftp\" scheme translates into the FTP protocol while the\n   \"mid\" scheme\
    \ translates into a Message-ID identifier of an email\n   message.  For such schemes,\
    \ the description of the mapping SHOULD be\n   complete and in sufficient detail\
    \ so that the mapping in both\n   directions is clear: how to map from a URI into\
    \ an identifier or set\n   of protocol actions or name in the target namespace,\
    \ and how legal\n   values in the base namespace, or legal protocol interactions,\
    \ are\n   represented in a valid URI.  See Section 3.6 for guidelines for\n  \
    \ encoding strings or sequences of bytes within valid character\n   sequences\
    \ in a URI.  If not all legal values or protocol interactions\n   of the base\
    \ standard can be represented using the scheme, the\n   definition SHOULD be clear\
    \ about which subset is allowed and why.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Definition of Operations
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Definition of Operations\n   As part of the definition of how a URI identifies\
    \ a resource, a\n   scheme definition SHOULD define the applicable set of operations\
    \ that\n   can be performed on a resource using the URI as its identifier.  A\n\
    \   model for this is HTTP methods; an HTTP resource can be operated on\n   by\
    \ GET, POST, PUT, and a number of other methods available through\n   the HTTP\
    \ protocol.  The scheme definition SHOULD describe all well-\n   defined operations\
    \ on the resource identifier and what they are\n   supposed to do.\n   Some schemes\
    \ don't fit into the \"information access\" paradigm of\n   URIs.  For example,\
    \ \"telnet\" provides location information for\n   initiating a bidirectional\
    \ data stream to a remote host; the only\n   operation defined is to initiate\
    \ the connection.  In any case, the\n   operations appropriate for a scheme SHOULD\
    \ be documented.\n   Note: It is perfectly valid to say that \"no operation apart\
    \ from GET\n   is defined for this URI.\"  It is also valid to say that \"there's\
    \ only\n   one operation defined for this URI, and it's not very GET-like.\" \
    \ The\n   important point is that what is defined on this scheme is described.\n\
    \   Scheme definitions SHOULD define a \"default\" operation for when a URI\n\
    \   is invoked (or \"dereferenced\") by an application.  For example, a\n   common\
    \ \"default\" operation today is to launch an application\n   associated with\
    \ the scheme name and let it use the other URI\n   components as inputs to do\
    \ something.  The default invocation, or\n   dereferencing, of a URI SHOULD be\
    \ \"safe\" in the sense described by\n   Section 3.4 of [W3CWebArch]; i.e., performing\
    \ such an invocation\n   should not incur any additional obligations by doing\
    \ so.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Context of Use
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Context of Use\n   In general, URIs are used within a broad range of protocols\
    \ and\n   applications.  For example, URIs are commonly used within hypertext\n\
    \   documents as references to other resources.  In some cases, a scheme\n   is\
    \ intended for use within a different, specific set of protocols or\n   applications.\
    \  If so, the scheme definition SHOULD describe the\n   intended use and include\
    \ references to documentation that define the\n   applications and/or protocols\
    \ cited.  This does not obviate the need\n   for documentation on applications\
    \ and/or protocols to discuss URI\n   schemes relevant to them.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Internationalization and Character Encoding
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Internationalization and Character Encoding\n   When describing schemes\
    \ in which (some of) the elements of the URI\n   are actually representations\
    \ of human-readable text, care should be\n   taken not to introduce unnecessary\
    \ variety in the ways in which\n   characters are encoded into octets and then\
    \ into URI characters; see\n   [RFC3987] and Section 2.5 (especially the last\
    \ paragraph) of\n   [RFC3986] for guidelines.  If URIs of a scheme contain any\
    \ text\n   fields, the scheme definition MUST describe the ways in which\n   characters\
    \ are encoded and any compatibility issues with IRIs of the\n   scheme.\n   The\
    \ scheme specification SHOULD be as restrictive as possible\n   regarding what\
    \ characters are allowed in the URI because some\n   characters can create several\
    \ different security issues (see, for\n   example, [RFC4690]).\n   Percent-encoded\
    \ character sequences are automatically included by\n   definition for characters\
    \ given in IRI productions.  This means that\n   if you want to restrict the URI\
    \ percent-encoded forms in some way,\n   you must restrict the Unicode forms that\
    \ would lead to them.  In most\n   cases, it is advisable to define the actual\
    \ characters allowed in an\n   IRI production in order to allow the 'pct-encoded'\
    \ definition from\n   Section 2.1 of [RFC3986] at the same places and to add prose\
    \ that\n   limits percent escapes to those that can be created by converting\n\
    \   valid UTF-8 character sequences to percent-encoding.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Clear Security and Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Clear Security and Privacy Considerations\n   Definitions of schemes MUST\
    \ be accompanied by a clear analysis of the\n   security and privacy implications\
    \ for systems that use the scheme;\n   this follows the practice of Security Consideration\
    \ sections within\n   IANA registrations [RFC5226].\n   In particular, Section\
    \ 7 of RFC 3986 [RFC3986] describes general\n   security considerations for URIs\
    \ while [RFC3987] gives those for\n   IRIs.  The definition of an individual scheme\

    \ any more scheme-\n   specific concerns.  For example, if the scheme-specific\
    \ part is\n   privacy sensitive, then that should be documented.\n"
- title: 3.8.  Scheme Name Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.8.  Scheme Name Considerations\n   Section 3.1 of RFC 3986 defines the syntax\
    \ of a URI scheme name; this\n   syntax remains the same for IRIs.  New scheme\
    \ registrations MUST\n   follow this syntax, which only allows a limited repertoire\
    \ of\n   characters (taken from US-ASCII).  Although the syntax for the scheme\n\
    \   name in URIs is case insensitive, the scheme name itself MUST be\n   registered\
    \ using lowercase letters.\n   Scheme names SHOULD be short but also sufficiently\
    \ descriptive and\n   distinguished to avoid problems.\n   Schemes SHOULD NOT\
    \ use names or other symbols that might cause\n   problems with rights to use\
    \ the name in IETF specifications and\n   Internet protocols.  For example, be\
    \ careful with trademark and\n   service mark names.  (See Section 3.4 of [RFC5378]).\n\
    \   Schemes SHOULD NOT use names that are either very general purpose or\n   associated\
    \ in the community with some other application or protocol.\n   Schemes also SHOULD\
    \ NOT use names that are overly general or\n   grandiose in scope (e.g., that\
    \ allude to their \"universal\" or\n   \"standard\" nature).\n   A scheme name\
    \ is not a \"protocol.\"  However, like a service name as\n   defined in Section\
    \ 5 of [RFC6335], it often identifies a particular\n   protocol or application.\
    \  If a scheme name has a one-to-one\n   correspondence with a service name, then\
    \ the names SHOULD be the\n   same.\n   Some organizations desire their own namespace\
    \ for URI scheme names\n   for private use (see Section 6).  In doing so, it is\
    \ important to\n   prevent collisions and to make it possible to identify the\
    \ owner of a\n   private-use scheme.  To accomplish these two goals, such\n  \
    \ organizations SHOULD use a prefix based on their domain name,\n   expressed\
    \ in reverse order.  For example, a URI scheme name of\n   com.example.mything\
    \ might be used by the organization that owns the\n   example.com domain name.\
    \  Care must be taken, however, if the\n   organization later loses the domain\
    \ name embedded in their scheme\n   names since domain name registrations are\
    \ not permanent.  To\n   associate the private-use scheme name with the original\
    \ organization,\n   the private-use scheme can be registered using the registration\n\
    \   procedure in Section 7.\n   Furthermore, to prevent collisions with private-use\
    \ scheme names, new\n   scheme names registered MUST NOT contain a \".\" unless\
    \ actually\n   constructed from a reversed domain name.\n"
- title: 3.9.  Interoperability Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.9.  Interoperability Considerations\n   If the person or group registering\
    \ the scheme is aware of any details\n   regarding the scheme that might impact\
    \ interoperability, identify\n   them, for example, proprietary or uncommon encoding\
    \ methods, or\n   incompatibility with types or versions of any underlying protocol.\n"
- title: 4.  Guidelines for Provisional URI Scheme Registration
  contents:
  - "4.  Guidelines for Provisional URI Scheme Registration\n   'Provisional' registration\
    \ can be used for schemes that are not part\n   of any standard but that are intended\
    \ for use (or observed to be in\n   use) that is not limited to a private environment\
    \ within a single\n   organization.  'Provisional' registration can also be used\
    \ as an\n   intermediate step on the way to 'permanent' registration, e.g.,\n\
    \   before the scheme specification is finalized as a standard.\n   For a 'provisional'\
    \ registration, the following apply:\n   o  The scheme name must meet the syntactic\
    \ requirements of\n      Section 3.8.\n   o  There must not already be an entry\
    \ with the same scheme name.  In\n      the unfortunate case that there are multiple,\
    \ different uses of\n      the same scheme name, the Designated Expert can approve\
    \ a request\n      to modify an existing entry to note the separate use.\n   o\
    \  Contact information identifying the person supplying the\n      registration\
    \ must be included.  Previously unregistered schemes\n      discovered in use\
    \ can be registered by third parties (even if not\n      on behalf of those who\
    \ created the scheme).  In this case, both\n      the registering party and the\
    \ scheme creator SHOULD be identified.\n   o  If no permanent, citable specification\

    \ for whatever reason is no longer in\n   common use or whose use is not recommended.\
    \  In this case, it is\n   possible for an individual to request that the URI\
    \ scheme be\n   registered (newly, or as an update to an existing registration)\
    \ as\n   'historical'.  Any scheme that is no longer in common use MAY be\n  \

  contents:
  - "6.  Guidelines for Private URI Scheme Use\n   Unregistered schemes can cause\
    \ problems if use is not limited to a\n   private environment within a single\
    \ organization since the use could\n   leak out beyond the closed environment.\
    \  Even within a closed\n   environment, other colliding uses of the same scheme\
    \ name could\n   occur.  As such, a unique namespace MUST be used and 'provisional'\n\
    \   registration is strongly encouraged (unless the scheme name is\n   constructed\
    \ from a domain name), as discussed in Section 3.8.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.1.  General\n   The IANA policy (using terms defined in [RFC5226]) for 'provisional'\n\
    \   registration was formerly Expert Review; this document changes the\n   policy\
    \ to First Come First Served.  The policy for 'permanent' and\n   'historical'\
    \ registration continues to be Expert Review.\n   The registration procedure is\
    \ intended to be very lightweight for\n   noncontentious registrations.  For the\
    \ most part, we expect the good\n   sense of submitters and reviewers, guided\
    \ by these procedures, to\n   achieve an acceptable and useful consensus for the\
    \ community.\n   In exceptional cases, where the negotiating parties cannot form\
    \ a\n   consensus, the final arbiter of any contested registration shall be\n\
    \   the IESG.\n   If standardization is anticipated, the working group or individuals\n\
    \   concerned are advised to submit an early 'permanent' registration\n   request\
    \ rather than waiting until the standardization process has run\n   its course.\
    \  IANA will pass this to the Designated Expert who may\n   recommend 'provisional'\
    \ registration until the specification is\n   approved as a standard.  This will\
    \ provide an opportunity for\n   feedback while specification development and\
    \ review is still active,\n   and while the submitter(s) are still in a position\
    \ to respond to any\n   issues that might be raised.  If and when the specification\
    \ is\n   approved as a standard, the submitters should submit a request to\n \
    \  change the registration status to 'permanent'.\n   The role of the Designated\
    \ Expert in the procedure for 'permanent'\n   registrations described here is\
    \ to ensure that the normal open review\n   process has been properly followed\
    \ and to raise possible concerns\n   about wider implications of proposals for\
    \ the use and deployment of\n   URIs.  Nothing in the procedure empowers the Designated\
    \ Expert to\n   override properly arrived-at IETF or working group consensus.\n"
- title: 7.2.  Registration Procedures
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Registration Procedures\n   Someone wishing to register a new scheme MUST:\n\
    \   1.  Check the IANA \"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes\"\n       registry\
    \ to see whether there is already an entry for the desired\n       name.  If there\
    \ is already an entry under the name, choose a\n       different scheme name or\
    \ update the existing scheme\n       specification.\n   2.  Prepare a scheme registration\
    \ request using the template\n       specified in Section 7.4.  The scheme registration\
    \ request can be\n       contained in an Internet-Draft, submitted alone, or as\
    \ part of\n       some other permanently available, stable, protocol specification.\n\
    \       The scheme registration request can also be submitted in some\n      \
    \ other form (as part of another document or as a stand-alone\n       document),\
    \ but the scheme registration request will be treated as\n       an \"IETF Contribution\"\
    \ under the guidelines of [RFC5378].\n   3.  If the registration request is for\
    \ a 'permanent' registration\n       (or, optionally, for any other registration\
    \ if desired):\n       1.  Review the requirements in Section 3.\n       2.  Send\
    \ a copy of the scheme registration request or a pointer\n           to the document\
    \ containing the request (with specific\n           reference to the section that\
    \ requests the scheme\n           registration) to the mailing list uri-review@ietf.org,\n\
    \           requesting review.  In addition, request review on other\n       \
    \    relevant mailing lists as appropriate.  For example, general\n          \
    \ discussion of URI syntactical issues can be discussed on\n           uri@w3.org;\
    \ schemes for a network protocol can be discussed\n           on a mailing list\
    \ for that protocol.  Allow a reasonable time\n           for discussion and comments.\
    \  Four weeks is reasonable for a\n           'permanent' registration request.\n\
    \       3.  Respond to review comments and make revisions to the proposed\n  \
    \         registration as needed to bring it into line with the\n           guidelines\
    \ given in this document.\n   4.  Submit the (possibly updated) scheme registration\
    \ request (or\n       pointer to document containing it) to IANA at iana@iana.org.\n\
    \   Upon receipt of a scheme registration request, the following steps\n   MUST\
    \ be followed:\n   1.  IANA checks the submission for completeness; if required\
    \ sections\n       of the scheme registration request are missing or any citations\n\
    \       are not correct, IANA will reject the registration request.  A\n     \
    \  registrant can resubmit a corrected request if desired.\n   2.  If the request\
    \ is for 'provisional' registration and no entry\n       already exists in the\
    \ current registry for the same name, IANA\n       adds the registration to the\
    \ registry under the First Come First\n       Served policy.\n   3.  Otherwise,\
    \ IANA enters the registration request in the IANA\n       registry with the status\
    \ marked as \"Pending Review\", and the\n       remainder of this section applies.\n\
    \   4.  IANA requests Expert Review of the registration request against\n    \
    \   the corresponding guidelines from this document.\n   5.  The Designated Expert\
    \ will evaluate the request against the\n       criteria of the requested status.\n\
    \   6.  In the case of a 'permanent' registration request, the Designated\n  \
    \     Expert may:\n       *  Accept the specification of the scheme for 'permanent'\n\
    \          registration.\n       *  Suggest 'provisional' registration instead.\n\
    \       *  Request IETF review and IESG approval; in the meanwhile,\n        \
    \  suggest 'provisional' registration.\n       *  Request additional review or\
    \ discussion as necessary.\n   7.  If an entry already exists for the same name,\
    \ the Designated\n       Expert will determine whether the request should be rejected\
    \ or\n       whether the existing entry should be modified to note the\n     \
    \  separate use.  This conflict process applies regardless of the\n       requested\
    \ status or the status of the existing entry.\n   8.  Once the Designated Expert\
    \ approves registration for a given\n       status, IANA updates the registration\
    \ to indicate the approved\n       status.  If the Designated Expert instead rejects\
    \ the\n       registration, the \"Pending Review\" request is removed from the\n\
    \       registry.\n   Either based on an explicit request or independently initiated,\
    \ the\n   Designated Expert or the IESG can request the upgrade of a\n   'provisional'\
    \ registration to a 'permanent' one.  In such cases, IANA\n   will update the\
    \ status of the corresponding entry.  Typically, this\n   would only occur if\
    \ the use is considered a standard (not necessarily\n   an IETF standard).\n"
