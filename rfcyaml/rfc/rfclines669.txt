November, 1974, Survey of New Protocol TELNET Servers Two months have elapsed since our last survey, and the appearance of additional New Protocol servers has progressed at the usual snail's pace.
The changes in this list are (with host numbers in octal): SRI AI (102) now has a New Protocol server; SDC LAB (10) is back on the net and the list; SDC CC (110) is coming on the net but status is as yet unknown; USC ISI (126) and USC ISIB (226) (formerly ISI DEVTENEX) now have New Protocol servers
; SDAC 44 (32) has been removed   no longer classed as a server host; HAWAII 500 (344) is coming on the net, status presently unknown; LONDON (52) has been added;
BBN TENEXD is now host 162 (formerly 205).
What follows is an update of the summary and tabulation that appeared in RFC #702.
Is there light at the end of the tunnel?
All data in this report were gathered via a surveying program run at various times, plus a few manual checks to fill out the data.
What is reported here is the way the various servers work as seen by the new Protocol User Telnet at BBNA, as of 4 Dec. 1974.
These are the sites whose operation is 100% correct according to all protocols and conventions, as I understand them.
(3) We realize that some of the servers that appear here as New  Protocol servers on socket 1 are actually servers which attempt to communicate with both Old  and New Protocol User TELNETs according to what control sequences are received.
Tabulation of server status for all server sites:
No server at this socket ?
Status not ascertained   unable to connect to host I
# Option # implemented outgoing from user
(# is option number in new Protocol.
All options implemented by anyone are: 0    Transmit Binary 1    Echo 3
Suppress Go Ahead 6    Timing Mark )
These servers return improper responses to some TELNET option requests.
