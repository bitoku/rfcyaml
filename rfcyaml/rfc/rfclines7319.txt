IANA Considerations for Connectivity Fault Management (CFM)
has specified Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) facilities.
CFM messages are structured with an OpCode field and have provision for the inclusion of TLV structured information.
IEEE 802.1 has allocated blocks of CFM OpCodes and TLV Types to the IETF.
This document specifies the IANA considerations for the assignment of values from these blocks.
The IEEE 802.1 Working Group has specified Connectivity Fault Management (CFM)
CFM messages are structured with an OpCode field and have provision for the inclusion of TLV structured information.
IEEE 802.1 has allocated the block of 32 CFM OpCodes from 64 through 95 and the block of 32 CFM TLV Types from 64 through 95 to the IETF (see Appendix A).
This document specifies the IANA considerations for the assignment of values from these two blocks.
IEEE 802.1 previously allocated similar blocks of values from 32 through 63 to ITU T [Y.1731].
Terminology Capitalized IANA terms such as "Standards Action" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC5226].
IANA Considerations IANA has created the "Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) OAM IETF Parameters" registry with the following two subregistries: Registry Name:
CFM OAM IETF OpCodes Registration Procedures:
This parameter originates with the IEEE 802.1 Working Group that has allocated the block of values from 64 to 95 to the IETF.
This parameter originates with the IEEE 802.1 Working Group that has allocated the block of values from 64 to 95 to the IETF.
Security Considerations This document is concerned with assignment of values from the blocks of IEEE 802.1 CFM OpCodes and TLV Types that the IEEE 802.1 Working Group has allocated to the IETF.
It is not directly concerned with security.
Thursday, 06 March 2014 Reference:  24 September 2013 Liaison from TRILL WG
After considering the referenced liaison from the TRILL WG, IEEE 802.1 has voted to approve the allocation of code points from the Connectivity Fault Management protocol of IEEE Std 802.1Q(TM) 2011 for use by IETF.
The expectation of IEEE 802.1 is that these code points will be allocated through IANA only on the basis of IETF standards actions.
Specifically, the allocation includes:   32 CFM OpCode Field values.
Std 802.1Q 2011 Clause 21.4.3, Table 21 4.
The OpCode Field values 64 95 10 are allocated to the IETF.
32 TLV Type Field values.
802.1Q 2011 Clause 21.5.1.1, Table 21 6.
The Type Field values 64 95 10 are allocated to the IETF.
IEEE Std 802.1Q will be revised at some future date to document this allocation.
In the meantime, the allocation will be recorded through the IEEE 802.1 maintenance process.
