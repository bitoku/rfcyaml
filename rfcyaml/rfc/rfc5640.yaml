  - "Abstract\n   Payloads transported over a Softwire mesh service (as defined by
    BGP\n   Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) information\n
    \  exchange) often carry a number of identifiable, distinct flows.  It\n   can,
    in some circumstances, be desirable to distribute these flows\n   over the equal
    cost multiple paths (ECMPs) that exist in the packet\n   switched network.  Currently,
    the payload of a packet entering the\n   Softwire can only be interpreted by the
    ingress and egress routers.\n   Thus, the load-balancing decision of a core router
    is only based on\n   the encapsulating header, presenting much less entropy than
    available\n   in the payload or the encapsulated header since the Softwire\n   encapsulation
    acts in a tunneling fashion.  This document describes a\n   method for achieving
    comparable load-balancing efficiency in a\n   network carrying Softwire mesh service
    over Layer Two Tunneling\n   Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) over IP or Generic
    Routing\n   Encapsulation (GRE) encapsulation to what would be achieved without\n
    \  such encapsulation.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Consider the case of a router R1 that encapsulates a packet
    P into a\n   Softwire bound to router R3.  R2 is a router on the shortest path\n
    \  from R1 to R3.  R2's shortest path to R3 involves equal cost multiple\n   paths
    (ECMPs).  The goal is for R2 to be able to choose which path to\n   use on the
    basis of the full entropy of packet P.\n   This is achieved by carrying in the
    encapsulation header a signature\n   of the inner header, hence enhancing the
    entropy of the flows as seen\n   by the core routers.  The signature is carried
    as part of one of the\n   fields of the encapsulation header.  To aid with better
    description\n   in the document, we define the generic term \"load-balancing field\"
    to\n   mean such a value that is specific to an encapsulation type.  For\n   example,
    for L2TPv3-over-IP [RFC3931] encapsulation, the load-\n   balancing field is the
    Session Identifier (Session ID).  For GRE\n   [RFC2784] encapsulation, the Key
    field [RFC2890], if present,\n   represents the load-balancing field.  This mechanism
    assumes that\n   core routers base their load-balancing decisions on a flow definition\n
    \  that includes the load-balancing field.  This is an obvious and\n   generic
    functionality as, for example, for L2TPv3-over-IP tunnels,\n   the Session ID
    is at the same well-known constant offset as the TCP/\n   UDP ports in the encapsulating
    header.\n   The Encapsulation SAFI [RFC5512] is extended such that a contiguous\n
    \  block of the load-balancing field is bound to the Softwire advertised\n   by
    a BGP next-hop.  On a per-inner-flow basis, the ingress Provider\n   Edge (PE)
    selects one value of the load-balancing field from the\n   block to preserve per-flow
    ordering and, at the same time, to enhance\n   the entropy across flows.\n"

  - "2.  Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV\n   This document defines a new sub-TLV for
    use with the Tunnel\n   Encapsulation Attribute defined in [RFC5512].  The new
    sub-TLV is\n   referred to as the \"Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV\" and MAY be
    included\n   in any Encapsulation SAFI UPDATE message where load-balancing is\n
    \  desired.\n   The sub-TLV type of the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV is 5.  The
    sub-\n   TLV length is 2 octets.  The value represents the length of the block\n
    \  in bits and MUST NOT exceed the size of the load-balancing field.\n   This
    format is very similar to the variable-length subnet masking\n   (VLSM) used in
    IP addresses to allow arbitrary length prefixes.  The\n   block is determined
    by extracting the initial sequence of 'block\n   size' bits from the load-balancing
    field.\n   If a load-balancing field is not signaled (e.g., if the encapsulation\n
    \  sub-TLV is not included in an advertisement as in the case of GRE\n   without
    a Key), then the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV MUST NOT be\n   included.\n   The
    smaller the value field of the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV, the\n   larger the
    space for per-flow identification, and hence the better\n   entropy for potential
    load-balancing in the core, as well as, the\n   lower the polarization when mapping
    flows to ECMP paths.  However,\n   reducing the load-balancing block size consumes
    more L2TPv3 Session\n   IDs or GRE Keys, resulting in potentially less numbers
    of supported\n   services.  A typical deployment would need to arbitrate between
    this\n   trade-off.\n   As an example, assume that there is a Softwire set up
    between R1 and\n   R3 with L2TPv3-over-IP tunnel type.  Assume that R3 encodes
    the\n   Session ID with value 0x1234ABCD in the encapsulation sub-TLV.  It\n   also
    includes the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV and encodes the value\n   24.  This
    should be interpreted as follows:\n   o  If an ingress router does not understand
    the Load-Balancing Block\n      sub-TLV, it continues to use the Session ID 0x1234ABCD
    and\n      encapsulates all packets with that Session ID.\n   o  If an ingress
    router understands the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV,\n      it picks the first
    24 bits out of the Session ID (0x1234AB) to be\n      used as the block and fills
    in the lower-order 8 bits with a per-\n      flow identifier (e.g., it can be
    determined based on the inner\n      packet's source, destination addresses, and
    TCP/UDP ports).  This\n      selection preserves the per-flow ordering of packets.\n
    \  This requirement and solution applies equally to GRE where the Key\n   plays
    the same role as the Session ID in L2TPv3.\n   Needless to say, if an egress router
    does not support the Load-\n   Balancing Block sub-TLV, the Softwire continues
    to operate with a\n   single load-balancing field with which all ingress routers\n
    \  encapsulate.\n"

    - "2.1.  Applicability to Tunnel Types\n   The Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV is
      applicable to tunnel types that\n   define a load-balancing field.  This document
      defines load-balancing\n   fields for tunnel types 1 (L2TPv3 over IP) and 2
      (GRE) as follows:\n   o  L2TPv3 over IP - Session ID.  Special care needs to
      be taken to\n      always create a non-zero Session ID.  When an egress router\n
      \     includes a Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV, it MUST encode the\n      Session
      ID field of the encapsulation sub-TLV in a way that\n      ensures that the
      most significant bits of the Session ID, after\n      extracting the block,
      are non-zero.\n   o  GRE - GRE Key\n   This document does not define a load-balancing
      field for the IP-in-IP\n   tunnel type (tunnel types 7).  Future tunnel types
      that desire to use\n   the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV MUST define a load-balancing
      field\n   that is part of the encapsulating header.\n"

    - "2.2.  Encapsulation Considerations\n   Fields included in the encapsulation
      header besides the load-\n   balancing field are not affected by the Load-Balancing
      Block sub-TLV.\n   All other encapsulation fields are shared between variations
      of the\n   load-balancing field.  For example, for the L2TPv3-over-IP tunnel\n
      \  type, if the optional cookie is included in the encapsulation sub-TLV\n   by
      the egress router during Softwire signaling, it applies to all the\n   \"Session
      ID\" values derived at the ingress router after applying the\n   load-balancing
      block as described in this document.\n"
