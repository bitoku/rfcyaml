  - "1.  Abstract\n   The Common Indexing Protocol (CIP) allows servers to form a\
    \ referral\n   mesh for query handling by defining a mechanism by which cooperating\n\
    \   servers exchange hints about the searchable indices they maintain.\n   The\
    \ structure and transport of CIP are described in (Ref. 1), as are\n   general\
    \ rules for the definition of index object types.  This\n   document describes\
    \ SOIF, the Summary Object Interchange Format, as an\n   index object type in\
    \ the context of the CIP framework.  SOIF is a\n   machine-readable syntax for\
    \ transmitting structured summary objects,\n   currently used primarily in the\
    \ context of the World Wide Web.\n   Query referral has often been dismissed as\
    \ an ineffective strategy\n   for handling searches of Web resources, and Web\
    \ resources certainly\n   present challenges not present in structured directory\
    \ services like\n   Rwhois.  In situations where a keyword-based free text search\
    \ is\n   desired, query referral is not likely to be effective because the\n \
    \  query will probably be routed to every server participating in the\n   referral\
    \ mesh.  Where a search can be limited by reference to a\n   specific resource\
    \ attribute, however, query referral is an effective\n   tool.  SOIF can be used\
    \ to create such a known-attribute query mesh\n   because it provides a method\
    \ for associating attributes with net-\n   addressable resources.\n"
- title: 1.1 History
  contents:
  - "1.1 History\n   SOIF was first defined by the Harvest project [Ref 2.] in January\n\
    \   1994.  SOIF was derived from a combination of the Internet Anonymous\n   FTP\
    \ Archives IETF Working Group (IAFA) templates [Ref 3.] and the\n   BibTeX bibliography\
    \ format [Ref 4.].  The combination was originally\n   noted for its advantages\
    \ of providing a convenient and intuitive way\n   for delimiting objects within\
    \ a stream, and setting apart the URL for\n   easy object access or invocation,\
    \ while still preserving\n   compatibility with IAFA templates.\n   Mic Bowman,\
    \ Darren Hardy, Mike Schwartz, and Duane Wessels each\n   contributed to the creation\
    \ of the SOIF format as part of the Harvest\n   Project; later work took place\
    \ as part of the FIND working group.\n"

- title: 3.  Payload Format
  contents:
  - "3.  Payload Format\n   Each summary object has 3 fundamental components: a template\
    \ type, a\n   URL, and zero or more ATTRIBUTE-VALUE pairs.  Because the VALUEs\
    \ in\n   the ATTRIBUTE-VALUE pairs may contain arbitrary data (cf. Section\n \
    \  3.5), SOIF objects should be encoded in Base64 unless the template\n   type\
    \ unambiguously establishes that the VALUEs do not contain binary\n   data.\n"
- title: 3.1  Template Type
  contents:
  - "3.1  Template Type\n   The Template type is used to identify the set of ATTRIBUTEs\
    \ contained\n   within a particular SOIF object.  SOIF does not define the template\n\
    \   types themselves; it only provides a way to associate the summary\n   object\
    \ with a predefined template type name.  Template types may be\n   registered\
    \ or unregistered.  Unregistered template types provide an\n   indication of available\
    \ ATTRIBUTE-VALUE pairs, but these may vary\n   both according to the original\
    \ resource and the method by which the\n   summary object was generated.  Registered\
    \ template types must refer\n   to a formally specified description of all mandatory\
    \ and optional\n   ATTRIBUTE-VALUE pairs available for that type.  See [10] for\
    \ a\n   description of the process of registering template types with the\n  \
    \ IANA.\n   Historically, the template types used by SOIF were derived from IAFA\n\
    \   template types (Ref. 3). SOIF objects generated by the Harvest system\n  \
    \ have a \"FILE\" template type; in current practice this is the most\n   common\
    \ template type.  The \"FILE\" template type is a generic template\n   type meant\
    \ to handle a large variety of web-based resources.  No\n   formal specification\
    \ of it is available, though a list of ATTRIBUTE-\n   VALUE pairs common to the\
    \ \"FILE\" template type is found in Appendix\n   A.  \"DOCUMENT\" and \"OBJECT\"\
    \ are other generic template-types.\n   The use of unregistered template types\
    \ obviously presents some\n   problems to the correct operation of query referral.\
    \  Two efforts\n   have been mounted to allow peer-to-peer agreement on the association\n\
    \   of template types with specific attribute sets: Netscape's RDM (Ref.\n   6)\
    \ and the STARTS project (Ref. 7).  Initially, CIP meshes based on\n   systems\
    \ which use unregisterested template types may need to use\n   these or similar\
    \ methods to associate template types with specific\n   attribute sets.\n   Mesh\
    \ operators are strongly encouraged, however, to migrate to\n   registered template\
    \ types as soon as is practical.  Registered\n   template types allow CIP meshes\
    \ to derive the definitions of\n   attributes, which enables multiple-language\
    \ interfaces to the base\n   attributes.  In addition, registered template types\
    \ allow CIP meshes\n   and other users of SOIF to establish the permitted data\
    \ types and\n   encodings of the VALUEs associated with each ATTRIBUTE.  This\
    \ makes\n   deriving the appropriate matching semantics for a particular VALUE\n\
    \   much more straightforward and eliminates the limitations of the\n   default\
    \ octet-by-octet matching (cf. Section 4.).\n"
- title: 3.2  URL
  contents:
  - "3.2  URL\n   Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) (Ref 5.) are used by SOIF as object\n\
    \   IDENTIFIERs.  SOIF associates its summary objects with net-\n   addressable\
    \ resources by using the URL by which the resource was\n   addressed as the initial\
    \ field of the object body.  See section 3.4\n   for the formal grammar associated\
    \ with SOIF objects.\n   This association allows the same resource to have multiple\
    \ summary\n   objects, differentiated only by the URL by which the resource was\n\
    \   accessed.  This possibility does not, however, impact the usability\n   of\
    \ the URL as an object IDENTIFIER. Furthermore, since it can be\n   argued that\
    \ the net address is a salient part of the metadata, there\n   may be compensating\
    \ benefits to using the URL as an object\n   IDENTIFIER.\n   As noted in Appendix\
    \ A, the Harvest project used several additional\n   identity attributes (\"Gatherer-Name\"\
    , \"Gatherer-Host\", \"Gatherer-\n   Port\" and \"Gatherer-Version\") to further\
    \ identify the provenance of a\n   particular object.  Within the context of CIP,\
    \ it may be useful to\n   identify the base sources of particular index objects;\
    \ see Appendix B\n   for one example of how a SOIF-based CIP hint could use the\
    \ base\n   source URL.\n"
- title: 3.3  ATTRIBUTE-VALUE pairs.
  contents:
  - "3.3  ATTRIBUTE-VALUE pairs.\n   Each summary object has zero or more ATTRIBUTE-VALUE\
    \ pairs, which\n   contain metadata about the net-addressable resource referenced\
    \ by the\n   URL.  Pairs are composed of an ATTRIBUTE IDENTIFIER, the length of\n\
    \   the VALUE, a delimeter, and the VALUE.  It should be stressed that\n   ATTRIBUTE\
    \ VALUE pairs are not CR/LF terminated, but parsed according\n   to grammar set\
    \ out in section 3.4.  In the examples in Section 3.6\n   and in many other representations\
    \ of SOIF objects, ATTRIBUTE-VALUE\n   pairs are represented on individual lines\
    \ to enhance readability.\n   VALUEs may contain CR/LF, however, and implementors\
    \ must be careful\n   to parse the full VALUE.  Implementors of SOIF parsers MUST\
    \ ignore\n   <CR>,<LF>,<TAB>,<SPACE>, or other whitespace found between the VALUE\n\
    \   of an ATTRIBUTE-VALUE pair and the ATTRIBUTE-IDENTIFIER of the\n   subsequent\
    \ pair.\n   The SOIF syntax does not explicitly allow for a single ATTRIBUTE to\n\
    \   have multiple VALUEs.  To handle multiple VALUEs for the same\n   ATTRIBUTE,\
    \ SOIF uses an ATTRIBUTE naming convention; a hyphen and\n   positive integer\
    \ are appended to the ATTRIBUTE name to create an\n   ATTRIBUTE IDENTIFIER VALUE\
    \ associated with a specific ATTRIBUTE.  For\n   example, the ATTRIBUTE IDENTIFIERs\
    \ \"Author-1\", \"Author-2\", and\n   \"Author-3\" can be used to represent three\
    \ VALUEs associated with the\n   ATTRIBUTE \"Author\" where a specific resource\
    \ has three authors.  See\n   section 4 for the implications of this strategy\
    \ on matching\n   semantics.\n"

- title: 4.  Matching Semantics
  contents:
  - "4.  Matching Semantics\n   As was discussed in Section 1, query referral of SOIF\
    \ objects will be\n   most effective when a query identifies a particular ATTRIBUTE\
    \ or set\n   of ATTRIBUTEs as the target of the query match.  A query-identified\n\
    \   ATTRIBUTE should be considered to match a SOIF ATTRIBUTE when a\n   case-insentive\
    \ character-by-character comparison matches that portion\n   of the ATTRIBUTE\
    \ IDENTIFIER prior to any hyphen-integer suffix.  For\n   example, a query which\
    \ asks for a match on the ATTRIBUTE \"author\"\n   should match the IDENTIFIERs\
    \ \"author\", \"Author\", \"AUTHOR\", and\n   \"Author-1\".  [10] discourages\
    \ the registration of template types\n   containing ATTRIBUTEs which have previously\
    \ been registered with\n   substantially different definitions.  This will help\
    \ eliminate mis-\n   referral, but a CIP mesh may nonetheless need to maintain\
    \ a thesaurus\n   matching ATTRIBUTEs from particular template-types to those\
    \ of other,\n   especially unregistered, template-types.\n   The matching semantics\
    \ appropriate for a particular VALUE are derived\n   from its data type and encoding.\
    \  For VALUEs associated with\n   ATTRIBUTEs which are part of a registered template\
    \ type, the data\n   type and encoding are readily available.  For VALUEs associated\
    \ with\n   ATTRIBUTES associated with unregistered template-types, an octet-by-\n\
    \   octet comparison is the default.  In cases where previous experience\n   has\
    \ demonstrated that a particular ATTRIBUTE contains string data, a\n   case-insensitive\
    \ substring match may be used.  For example, in a\n   query against the \"AUTHOR\"\
    \ ATTRIBUTE of the generic \"DOCUMENT\"\n   template type, the query VALUE \"\
    Garcia\" should match the SOIF VALUEs\n   \"Garcia\", \"GARCIA\", and \"Jose Garcia\
    \ y Montes\".\n   Over time, there may well emerge an understanding of which attributes\n\
    \   tend to produce correct query referrals within a mesh.  As such\n   understandings\
    \ emerge, mesh maintainers may wish to define a\n   particular SOIF TEMPLATE-TYPE\
    \ which restricts included ATTRIBUTES to\n   those likely to foster correct referrals.\n"
- title: 5.  Internationalization
  contents:
  - "5.  Internationalization\n   The internationalization of SOIF depends on the\
    \ registration of\n   template-types.  Since TEMPLATE-TYPEs and ATTRIBUTE IDENTIFIERs\
    \ must\n   be in ASCII characters, only languages which use the ASCII character\n\
    \   set are fully supported for unregistered TEMPLATE-TYPEs.  For\n   registered\
    \ template types, in contrast, the specification of an\n   ATTRIBUTE's definition\
    \ will allow UI designers to present a native-\n   language mapping of the ATTRIBUTE\
    \ to the end user.  Further, the\n   inclusion of data type and encoding information\
    \ in the description of\n   VALUEs means that any language encoding or character\
    \ set required by\n   a particular application may be supported.  For unregistered\
    \ template\n   types, the ability of peer servers to pass schema definitions may\n\
    \   provide a form of \"private registration\" which could provide some of\n \
    \  the facilities for internationalization available to registered\n   template\
    \ types.  (See above, section 3.1 and Refs. 6 and 7.)\n"

  - "Appendix B.\n   Proposed Attributes for a \"CIP-HINT\" Template Type\n   Attribute-Identifier-List\n\
    \      A comma-delimited list whose entries take the form Template-\n      Type:Attribute\
    \ .  This list identifies the attributes against\n      which queries are supported.\
    \  Because of the current limitation on\n      Identifiers, this list must be\
    \ in ASCII.\n   Source\n      The URI of the service which created some or all\
    \ of the index\n      objects to which this hint applies.  Note that this service\
    \ may be\n      and often is distinct from the server which provides query access\n\
    \      to those objects.\n   Total-Object-Count\n      The total number of index\
    \ objects in the collection for which the\n      Hint applies.  This should be\
    \ a positive integer.\n   Weightlist-[Attribute-Identifier]\n      This construction\
    \ allows the HINT to contain a weighted list of\n      values for a specific Attribute-Identifier.\
    \  There may be as many\n      Weightlist entries as there Attribute-Identifiers\
    \ in the\n      Attribute-Identifier-List.  Each Weightlist entry takes the form\n\
    \      of Value;Object-Count, where the object count is a positive\n      integer\
    \ representing the number of objects within the collection\n      which contain\
    \ that value. Weightlists are comma- delimited.\n      Should a Value contain\
    \ a comma, it should be escaped when\n      incorporated into the weightlist.\n\
    \   Threshold-[Attribute-Identifier]\n      If a server wishes not to report infrequently\
    \ occurring Values in\n      a specific Weightlist, it may declare a threshold\
    \ under which it\n      will not report Values.\n   Certification-Type\n     \
    \ The type of Certification used for this object\n   Certification\n      The\
    \ Value of the Certification.\n   Date\n      The Date at which the hint was generated\n\

  - "Appendix C.\n   A \"Dublin-Core\" Template Type [Ref. 8,9]\n   TITLE\n      The\
    \ name given to the resource by the CREATOR or PUBLISHER.\n   CREATOR\n      The\
    \ person(s) or organization(s) primarily responsible for the\n      intellectual\
    \ content of the resource.  For example, authors in the\n      case of written\
    \ documents, artists, photographers, or illustrators\n      in the case of visual\
    \ resources.\n   SUBJECT\n      The topic of the resource, or keywords or phrases\
    \ that describe\n      the subject or content of the resource.  The intent of\
    \ the\n      specification of this element is to promote the use of controlled\n\
    \      vocabularies and keywords.  This element might well include\n      scheme-qualified\
    \ classification data (for example, Library of\n      Congress Classification\
    \ Numbers or Dewey Decimal numbers) or\n      scheme-qualified controlled vocabularies\
    \ (such as Medical Subject\n      Headings or Art and Architecture Thesaurus descriptors)\
    \ as well.\n   DESCRIPTION\n      A textual description of the content of the\
    \ resource, including\n      abstracts in the case of document-like objects or\
    \ content\n      descriptions in the case of visual resources.  Future metadata\n\
    \      collections might well include computational content description\n    \
    \  (spectral analysis of a visual resource, for example) that may not\n      be\
    \ embeddable in current network systems.  In such a case this\n      field might\
    \ contain a link to such a description rather than the\n      description itself.\n\
    \   PUBLISHER\n      The entity responsible for making the resource available\
    \ in its\n      present form, such as a publisher, a university department, or\
    \ a\n      corporate entity.   The intent of specifying this field is to\n   \
    \   identify the entity that provides access to the resource.\n   CONTRIBUTOR\n\
    \      Person(s) or organization(s) in addition to those specified in the\n  \
    \    CREATOR element who have made significant intellectual\n      contributions\
    \ to the resource but whose contribution is secondary\n      to the individuals\
    \ or entities specifed in the CREATOR element\n      (for example, editors, transcribers,\
    \ illustrators, and convenors).\n   DATE\n      The date the resource was made\
    \ available in its present form.  The\n      recommended best practice is an 8\
    \ digit number in the form\n      YYYYMMDD as defined by ANSI X3.30-1985. In this\
    \ scheme, the date\n      element for the day this is written would be 19961203,\
    \ or December\n      3, 1996.  Many other schema are possible, but if used, they\
    \ should\n      be identified in an unambiguous manner.\n   TYPE\n      The category\
    \ of the resource, such as home page, novel, poem,\n      working paper, technical\
    \ report, essay, dictionary.  It is\n      expected that RESOURCE TYPE will be\
    \ chosen from an enumerated list\n      of types.\n   FORMAT\n      The data representation\
    \ of the resource, such as text/html, ASCII,\n      Postscript file,  executable\
    \ application, or JPEG image.  The\n      intent of specifying this element is\
    \ to provide information\n      necessary to allow people or machines to make\
    \ decisions about the\n      usability of the encoded data (what hardware and\
    \ software might be\n      required to display or execute it, for example).  As\
    \ with RESOURCE\n      TYPE, FORMAT will be assigned from enumerated lists such\
    \ as\n      registered Internet Media Types (MIME types).  In principal,\n   \
    \   formats can include physical media such as books, serials, or\n      other\
    \ non-electronic media.\n   IDENTIFIER\n      String or number used to uniquely\
    \ identify the resource.  Examples\n      for networked resources include URLs\
    \ and URNs (when implemented).\n      Other globally-unique identifiers,such as\
    \ International Standard\n      Book Numbers (ISBN) or other formal names would\
    \ also be candidates\n      for this element.\n   SOURCE\n      The work, either\
    \ print or electronic, from which this resource is\n      derived, if applicable.\
    \ For example, an html encoding of a\n      Shakespearean sonnet might identify\
    \ the paper version of the\n      sonnet from which the electronic version was\
    \ transcribed.\n   LANGUAGE\n      Language(s) of the intellectual content of\
    \ the resource.  Where\n      practical, the content of this field should coincide\
    \ with the NISO\n      Z39.53 three character codes for written languages.\n \
    \  RELATION\n      Relationship to other resources.  The intent of specifying\
    \ this\n      element is to provide a means to express relationships among\n \
    \     resources that have formal relationships to others, but exist as\n     \
    \ discrete resources themselves.  For example, images in a document,\n      chapters\
    \ in a book, or items in a collection.  A formal\n      specification of RELATION\
    \ is currently under development.  Users\n      and developers should understand\
    \ that use of this element should\n      be currently considered experimental.\n\
    \   COVERAGE\n      The spatial locations and temporal durations characteristic\
    \ of the\n      resource.    Formal specification of COVERAGE is currently under\n\
    \      development. Users and developers should understand that use of\n     \
    \ this element should be currently considered experimental.\n   RIGHTS\n     \
    \ The content of this element is intended to be a link (a URL or\n      other\
    \ suitable URI as appropriate) to a copyright notice, a\n      rights-management\
    \ statement, or perhaps a server that would\n      provide such information in\
    \ a dynamic way.  The intent of\n      specifying this field is to allow providers\
    \ a means to associate\n      terms and conditions or copyright statements with\
    \ a resource or\n      collection of resources.   No assumptions should be made\
    \ by users\n      if such a field is empty or not present.\n   Example:\n"
