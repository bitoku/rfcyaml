  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4216] defines the scenarios motivating the deployment\
    \ of inter-AS\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS TE)\
    \ and\n   specifies the requirements for inter-AS MPLS TE when the ASes are\n\
    \   under the administration of one Service Provider (SP) or the\n   administration\
    \ of different SPs.\n   Three signaling options are defined for setting up an\
    \ inter-AS TE\n   Label Switched Path (LSP):\n       1) contiguous TE LSP as documented\
    \ in [RFC5151];\n       2) stitched inter-AS TE LSP discussed in [RFC5150];\n\
    \       3) nested TE LSP as in [RFC4206].\n   [RFC5152] defines mechanisms for\
    \ the computation of inter-domain TE\n   LSPs using network elements along the\
    \ signaling paths to compute\n   per-domain constrained path segments.  The mechanisms\
    \ in [RFC5152] do\n   not guarantee an optimum constrained path across multiple\
    \ ASes where\n   an optimum path for a TE LSP is one that has the smallest cost,\n\
    \   according to a normalized TE metric (based upon a TE metric or\n   Interior\
    \ Gateway Protocol (IGP) metric adopted in each transit AS)\n   among all possible\
    \ paths that satisfy the LSP TE constraints.\n   The Path Computation Element\
    \ (PCE) [RFC4655] is a component that is\n   capable of computing paths for MPLS\
    \ TE and Generalized Multiprotocol\n   Label Switching Protocol ((G)MPLS TE) LSPs.\
    \  The requirements for a\n   PCE have come from SP demands to compute optimum\
    \ constrained paths\n   across multiple areas and/or domains, and to be able to\
    \ separate the\n   path computation elements from the forwarding elements.\n \
    \  The PCE Communication Protocol (PCECP) is defined to allow\n   communication\
    \ between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs, and\n   between PCEs.  The\
    \ PCECP is used to request (G)MPLS TE paths and to\n   supply computed paths in\
    \ response.  Generic requirements for the\n   PCECP are discussed in [RFC4657].\
    \  This document provides a set of\n   PCECP requirements that are specific to\
    \ inter-AS (G)MPLS TE path\n   computation.\n"

    \ Inter- and Intra-AS PCE Reference Model\n   Let's follow a scenario that illustrates\
    \ the interaction among PCCs,\n   inter-AS PCEs, and intra-AS PCEs, as shown in\
    \ Figure 1.  R1 in AS1\n   wants to setup a (G)MPLS TE path, call it LSP1, with\
    \ certain\n   constraints to R7 in AS3.  R1 determines, using mechanisms out of\
    \ the\n   scope of this document, that R7 is an inter-AS route and that R1\n \
    \  (itself) needs to contact its Inter-AS PCE1 to compute the path.  R1,\n   as\
    \ a PCC, sends a PCECP path computation request to PCE1.  PCE1\n   determines\
    \ that R7 is reachable via AS2 and that PCE2 is the PCE to\n   ask for path computation\
    \ across AS2.  PCE1 sends a PCECP path\n   computation request to PCE2.  Inter-AS\
    \ PCE2, in turn, sends a PCECP\n   path computation request to Intra-AS PCE R4\
    \ to compute a path within\n   AS2 (in certain cases, the same router such as\
    \ R3 can assume both\n   inter-AS and intra-AS path computation functions).  R4\
    \ may for\n   instance return a PCECP path computation response to PCE2 with ASBR3\n\
    \   as the entry point to AS2 from AS1 and ASBR7 as the exit point to\n   AS3.\
    \  PCE2 then sends a PCECP path computation request to PCE3 to\n   compute the\
    \ path segment across AS3, starting at ASBR7 and\n   terminating at R7.  PCE3\
    \ returns a PCECP path computation response to\n   PCE2 with the path segment\
    \ ASBR7-R7.  PCE2 then returns path ASBR3-\n   ASBR5-ASBR7-R7 to PCE1, which,\
    \ in turn, returns path ASBR1-ASBR3-\n   ASBR5-ASBR7-R7 to PCC R1.\n   As described\
    \ in the above scenario, in general, a PCC may contact an\n   inter-AS PCE to\
    \ request the computation of an inter-AS path.  That\n   PCE may supply the path\
    \ itself or may solicit the services of other\n   PCEs, which may themselves be\
    \ inter-AS PCEs, or may be intra-AS PCEs\n   with the responsibility for computing\
    \ path segments within just one\n   AS.\n   This document describes the PCE Communication\
    \ Protocol requirements\n   for inter-AS path computation, i.e., for PCCs to communicate\
    \ path\n   computation requests for inter-AS (G)MPLS TE paths to PCEs, and for\n\
    \   the PCEs to respond.  It also includes the requirements for PCEs to\n   communicate\
    \ inter-AS path computation requests and responses.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Scope of Deployment Model
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Scope of Deployment Model\n   All attempts to predict future deployment\
    \ scopes within the Internet\n   have proven fruitless.  Nevertheless, it may\
    \ be helpful to provide\n   some discussion of the scope of the inter-AS deployment\
    \ model as\n   envisioned at the time of writing.\n   It is expected that most,\
    \ if not all, inter-AS PCECP-based\n   communications will be between PCEs operating\
    \ in the cooperative PCE\n   model described in [RFC4655].  Clearly, in this model,\
    \ the requesting\n   PCE acts as a PCC for the purpose of issuing a path computation\n\
    \   request, but nevertheless, the requesting node fills the wider role\n   of\
    \ a PCE in its own AS.  It is currently considered unlikely that a\n   PCC (for\
    \ example, a normal Label Switching Router) will make a path\n   computation request\
    \ to a PCE outside its own AS.  This means that the\n   PCECP relationships between\
    \ ASes are limited to at most n squared\n   (n^2), where n is the number of peering\
    \ PCEs in the various ASes\n   (considered to be no greater than 100 in [RFC4657]).\
    \  In practice,\n   however, it is likely that only a few PCEs in one AS will\
    \ be\n   designated for PCECP communications with a PCE in an adjacent AS, and\n\
    \   each of these will only have a few PCEs in the adjacent AS to choose\n   from.\
    \  A deployment model might place the PCEs as co-resident with\n   the ASBRs,\
    \ resulting in a manageable scaling of the PCE-PCE\n   relationships.  Scaling\
    \ considerations (Section 4.2), manageability\n   considerations (Section 4.3),\
    \ and security considerations (Section 5)\n   should be examined in the light\
    \ of these deployment expectations.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Requirements for Path Computation Requests\n   The following are inter-AS\
    \ specific requirements for PCECP requests\n   for path computation:\n   1. [RFC4657]\
    \ states the requirement for a priority level to be\n      associated with each\
    \ path computation request.  This document does\n      not change that requirement.\
    \  However, PCECP should include a\n      mechanism that enables an inter-AS PCE\
    \ to inform the requesting\n      inter-AS PCE of a change in the request priority\
    \ level that may\n      have resulted from the application of a local policy.\n\
    \   2. A path computation request by an inter-AS PCE or a PCC to another\n   \
    \   inter-AS PCE MUST be able to specify the sequence of ASes and/or\n      ASBRs\
    \ across the network by providing ASBRs and/or ASes as hops in\n      the desired\
    \ path of the TE LSP to the destination.  For instance,\n      an inter-AS PCE\
    \ MUST be able to specify to the inter-AS PCE\n      serving the neighboring AS\
    \ a preferred ASBR for exiting to that AS\n      and reach the destination.  That\
    \ is, where multiple ASBRs exist,\n      the requester MUST be able to indicate\
    \ a preference for one of\n      them.  The PCE must be able to indicate whether\
    \ the specified ASBR\n      or AS is mandatory or non-mandatory on the (G)MPLS\
    \ TE path.\n   3. PCECP MUST allow a requester to provide a list of ASes and/or\n\
    \      ASBRs to be excluded from the computed path.\n   4. A PCECP path computation\
    \ request from one inter-AS PCE to another\n      MUST include the AS number of\

    \ inter-AS PCE or an\n      inter-AS PCE to another MUST be able to specify the\
    \ need for\n      protection against node, link, or Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG)\n\
    \      failure using 1:1 detours or facility backup.  It MUST be possible\n  \
    \    to request protection across all ASes or across specific ASes.\n   6. PCECP\

    \ or to be limited\n      to a specific AS.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Requirements for Path Computation Responses
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Requirements for Path Computation Responses\n   The following are inter-AS\
    \ specific requirements for PCECP responses\n   for path computation:\n   1. A\
    \ PCECP path computation response from one inter-AS PCE to another\n      MUST\
    \ be able to include both ASBRs and ASes in the computed path\n      while preserving\
    \ path segment and topology confidentiality.\n   2. A PCECP path computation response\
    \ from one inter-AS PCE to the\n      requesting inter-AS PCE MUST be able to\
    \ carry an identifier for a\n      path segment it computes to preserve path segment\
    \ and topology\n      confidentiality.  The objective of the identifier is to\
    \ be\n      included in the TE LSP signaling, whose mechanism is out of scope\n\
    \      of this document, to be used for path expansion during LSP\n      signaling.\n\
    \   3. If a constraint for a desired ASBR (see Section 4.1.1, requirement\n  \
    \    2) cannot be satisfied by a PCE, PCECP SHOULD allow the PCE to\n      notify\
    \ the requester of that fact as an error in a path\n      computation response.\n\
    \   4. A PCECP path computation response from an inter-AS PCE to a\n      requesting\

    \ cost.  Path cost normalization across\n      ASes is out of scope of this document.\n\
    \   5. A PCECP path computation response from an inter-AS PCE to a PCC\n     \
    \ SHOULD be able to carry the intra-AS cost of the path segment\n      within\
    \ the PCC AS.\n   6. A PCECP path computation response MUST be able to identify\n\
    \      diversified paths for the same (G)MPLS TE LSP.  End-to-end (i.e.,\n   \
    \   between the two endpoints of the (G)MPLS TE tunnel) disjoint paths\n     \
    \ are paths that do not share nodes, links, or SRLGs except for the\n      LSP\
    \ head-end and tail-end.  In cases where diversified path\n      segments are\
    \ desired within one or more ASes, the disjoint path\n      segments may share\

    \ for PCECP management.  This\n   document specifies new requirements that apply\
    \ to inter-AS\n   operations.\n   The PCECP MIB module MUST provide objects to\
    \ control the behavior of\n   PCECP in inter-AS applications.  These objects include\
    \ the ASes\n   within the scope of an inter-AS PCE, inter-AS PCEs in neighboring\n\
    \   ASes to which the requesting PCE will or will not communicate,\n   confidentiality,\
    \ and policies.\n   The built-in diagnostic tools MUST enable failure detection\
    \ and\n   status checking of PCC/PCE-PCE PCECP.  Diagnostic tools include\n  \
    \ statistics collection on the historical behavior of PCECP as\n   specified in\
    \ [RFC4657], but additionally it MUST be possible to\n   analyze these statistics\
    \ on a neighboring AS basis (i.e., across the\n   inter-AS PCEs that belong to\
    \ a neighboring AS).\n   The MIB module MUST support trap functions when thresholds\

    \ allow control of liveliness\n   check behavior by providing a liveliness message\
    \ frequency MIB\n   object, and this frequency object SHOULD be specified per\
    \ inter-AS\n   PCE peer.  In addition, there SHOULD be a MIB object that specifies\n\
    \   the dead-interval as a multiplier of the liveliness message frequency\n  \
    \ so that if no liveliness message is received within that time from an\n   inter-AS\
    \ PCE, the inter-AS PCE is declared unreachable.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Confidentiality\n   Confidentiality mainly applies to inter-provider (inter-AS)\
    \ PCE\n   communication.  It is about protecting the information exchanged\n \
    \  between PCEs and about protecting the topology information within an\n   SP's\
    \ network.  Confidentiality rules may also apply among ASes owned\n   by a single\
    \ SP.  Each SP will in most cases designate some PCEs for\n   inter-AS (G)MPLS\
    \ TE path computation within its own administrative\n   domain and some other\
    \ PCEs for inter-provider inter-AS (G)MPLS TE\n   path computation.  Among the\
    \ inter-provider-scoped inter-AS PCEs in\n   each SP domain, there may also be\
    \ a subset of the PCEs specifically\n   enabled for path computation across a\
    \ specific set of ASes of\n   different peer SPs.\n   PCECP MUST allow an SP to\
    \ hide from other SPs the set of hops within\n   its own ASes that are traversed\
    \ by an inter-AS inter-provider TE LSP\n   (c.f., Section 5.2.1 of [RFC4216]).\
    \  In a multi-SP administrative\n   domain environment, SPs may want to hide their\
    \ network topologies for\n   security or commercial reasons.  Thus, for each inter-AS\

- title: 4.5.1.  Inter-AS PCE Peering Policy Controls
  contents:
  - "4.5.1.  Inter-AS PCE Peering Policy Controls\n   An inter-AS PCE sends path computation\
    \ requests to its neighboring\n   inter-AS PCEs, and an inter-AS PCE that receives\
    \ such a request\n   enforces policies applicable to the sender of the request.\
    \  These\n   policies may include rewriting some of the parameters or rejecting\n\
    \   requests based on parameter values.  Such policies may be applied for\n  \
    \ PCEs belonging to different SPs or to PCEs responsible for ASes\n   within a\
    \ single SP administrative domain.  Parameters that might be\n   subject to policy\
    \ include bandwidth, setup/holding priority, Fast\n   Reroute request, Differentiated\
    \ Services Traffic Engineering (DS-TE)\n   Class Type (CT), and others as specified\
    \ in section 5.2.2.1 of\n   [RFC4216].\n   For path computation requests that\
    \ are not compliant with locally\n   configured policies, PCECP SHOULD enable\
    \ a PCE to send an error\n   message to the requesting PCC or PCE indicating that\
    \ the request has\n   been rejected because a specific parameter did not satisfy\
    \ the local\n   policy.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.5.2.  Inter-AS PCE Re-Interpretation Policies\n   Each SP may have different\
    \ definitions in its use of, for example,\n   DS-TE TE classes.  An inter-AS PCE\
    \ receiving a path computation\n   request needs to interpret the parameters and\
    \ constraints and adapt\n   them to the local environment.  Specifically, a request\
    \ constructed\n   by a PCC or PCE in one AS may have parameters and constraints\
    \ that\n   should be interpreted differently or translated by the receiving PCE\n\
    \   that is in a different AS.  A list of signaling parameters subject to\n  \
    \ policy re-interpretation at AS borders can be found in section\n   5.2.2.2 of\
    \ [RFC4216], and the list for path computation request\n   parameters and constraints\
    \ is the same.  In addition, the transit SPs\n   along the inter-AS TE path may\
    \ be GMPLS transport providers, which\n   may require re-interpretation of MPLS-specific\
    \ PCECP path computation\n   request objects in order to enable path computation\
    \ over a GMPLS\n   network or vice versa.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The PCECP is a communications protocol for use\
    \ between potentially\n   remote entities (PCCs and PCEs) over an IP network.\
    \  Security\n   concerns arise in order to protect the PCC, PCE, and the information\n\
    \   they exchange.  [RFC4758] specifies requirements on the PCECP to\n   protect\
    \ against spoofing, snooping, and DoS attacks.  That document\n   is concerned\
    \ with general protocol requirements applicable to the\n   basic use of the PCECP.\
    \  This document is specific to the application\n   of the PCE architecture in\
    \ an inter-AS environment, and so it is\n   appropriate to highlight the security\
    \ considerations that apply in\n   that environment.\n   Security requirements\
    \ that exist within a single administrative\n   domain become critical in the\
    \ multi-AS case when the control of IP\n   traffic and access to the network may\
    \ leave the authority of a single\n   administration.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Use and Distribution of Keys
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Use and Distribution of Keys\n   How the participants in a PCECP session\
    \ discover each other and the\n   need for the session is out of scope of this\
    \ document.  It may be\n   through configuration or automatic discovery.  However,\
    \ when a PCECP\n   session is established, the PCECP speakers MUST have mechanisms\
    \ to\n   authenticate each other's identities and validate the data they\n   exchange.\
    \  They also SHOULD have mechanisms to protect the data that\n   they exchange\
    \ via encryption.  Such mechanisms usually require the\n   use of keys, and so\
    \ the PCECP MUST describe techniques for the\n   exchange and use of security\
    \ keys.  Where inter-AS PCE discovery is\n   used, and PCECP security is required,\
    \ automated key distribution\n   mechanisms MUST also be used.  Since such key\
    \ exchange must\n   (necessarily) operate over an AS boundary, proper consideration\
    \ needs\n   to be given to how inter-AS key exchanges may be carried out and how\n\
    \   the key exchange, itself, may be secured.  Key distribution\n   mechanisms\
    \ MUST be defined with consideration of [RFC4107].  Where a\n   PCECP session\
    \ is configured between a pair of inter-AS PCEs, a\n   security key may be manually\
    \ set for that session.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Application of Policy
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Application of Policy\n   Policy forms an important part of the operation\
    \ of PCEs in an inter-\n   AS environment as described in Section 4.5, especially\
    \ when ASes are\n   administrated by different SPs.  A wider discussion of the\n\
    \   application of policy to the PCE architecture can be found in\n   [PCE-POLICY].\n\
    \   Policy may also form part of the security model for the PCECP and may\n  \
    \ be particularly applicable to inter-AS path computation requests.  A\n   fundamental\
    \ element of the application of policy at a PCE is the\n   identity of the requesting\
    \ PCC/PCE.  This makes the use of\n   authentication described in Section 5.1\
    \ particularly important.\n   Where policy information is exchanged as part of\
    \ the computation\n   request and/or response, the policy object is transparent\
    \ to the\n   PCECP being delivered un-inspected and unmodified to the policy\n\
    \   component of a PCE or PCC.  Therefore, the policy components are\n   responsible\
    \ for protecting (for example, encrypting) the policy\n   information and using\
    \ additional identification and authentication if\n   a higher level of validation\
    \ is required than is provided by the base\n   protocol elements of the PCECP.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Confidentiality\n   The PCECP MUST provide a mechanism to preserve the\
    \ confidentiality of\n   path segments computed by a PCE in one AS and provided\
    \ in a\n   computation response to another AS.\n   Furthermore, a PCE SHOULD be\
    \ provided with a mechanism to mask its\n   identity such that its presence in\
    \ the path computation chain in a\n   cooperative PCE model (such as described\
    \ in [BRPC]) cannot be derived\n   from the computed path.  This will help to\
    \ protect the PCE from\n   targeted attacks.  Clearly, such confidentiality does\
    \ not extend to\n   the PCECP peer (i.e., a PCC or another PCE) that invokes the\
    \ PCE with\n   a path computation request.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Falsification of Information
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Falsification of Information\n   In the PCE architecture, when PCEs cooperate,\
    \ one PCE may return a\n   path computation result that is composed of multiple\
    \ path segments,\n   each computed by a different PCE.  In the inter-AS case,\
    \ each PCE may\n   belong to a different administrative domain, and the source\
    \ PCC might\n   not know about the downstream PCEs, nor fully trust them.  Although\n\
    \   it is possible and RECOMMENDED to establish a chain of trust between\n   PCEs,\
    \ this might not always be possible.  In this case, it becomes\n   necessary to\
    \ guard against a PCE changing the information provided by\n   another downstream\
    \ PCE.  Some mechanism MUST be available in the\n   PCECP, and echoed in the corresponding\
    \ signaling, that allows an AS\n   to verify that the signaled path conforms to\
    \ the path segment\n   computed by the local PCE and returned on the path computation\n\
    \   request.\n"
