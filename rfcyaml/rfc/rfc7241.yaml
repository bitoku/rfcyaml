- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document contains a set of principles and guidelines\
    \ that serve\n   as the basis for coordination between Project 802 of the Institute\
    \ of\n   Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE 802) and the Internet\n  \
    \ Engineering Task Force (IETF), a program under the Internet Society\n   (ISOC)\
    \ organizational umbrella [BCP101].  The objective is to\n   encourage timely\
    \ development of technical specifications that\n   facilitate maximum interoperability\
    \ with existing (fixed and mobile)\n   Internet systems, devices, and protocols.\
    \  Each organization will\n   operate according to their own rules and procedures\
    \ including rules\n   governing IPR policy, specification elaboration, approval,\
    \ and\n   maintenance.\n   While this document is intended to improve cooperation\
    \ between the\n   two organizations, it does not change any of the formal practices\
    \ or\n   procedures of either organization.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Why Cooperate?
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Why Cooperate?\n   IEEE 802 and the IETF are independent standards organizations\
    \ that\n   each use standards produced by the other organization and develop\n\
    \   standards dependent on those produced by the other organization.\n   This\
    \ dependency may extend to carrying attributes in protocols that\n   reflect technologies\
    \ defined by the other organization.\n   The dependencies between IEEE 802 and\
    \ IETF standards are a motivation\n   for cooperation between the organizations.\
    \  However, since the\n   benefits of cooperation come at the cost of coordination\
    \ overhead,\n   the benefits of coordination must outweigh the cost.\n   The IETF\
    \ benefits from coordination by obtaining improved access to\n   IEEE 802 expertise\
    \ in the widely deployed and widely used IEEE 802\n   Local Area Network architecture\
    \ [ARCH802].\n   IEEE 802 benefits from coordination by obtaining improved access\
    \ to\n   IETF expertise on IP datagram encapsulation, routing, transport, and\n\
    \   security, as well as specific applications of interest to IEEE 802.\n"
- title: 2.  Organization, Participation, and Membership
  contents:
  - "2.  Organization, Participation, and Membership\n   IEEE 802 and IETF are similar\
    \ in some ways but different in others.\n   When working on projects of interest\
    \ to both organizations, it is\n   important to understand the similarities and\
    \ differences.\n"
- title: 2.1.  IEEE 802
  contents:
  - "2.1.  IEEE 802\n   The IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) is the standards-setting\n\
    \   body of the IEEE.  The IEEE-SA Standards Board oversees the IEEE\n   standards\
    \ development process.\n   The IEEE-SA Standards Board supervises what IEEE calls\
    \ \"sponsors\" --\n   IEEE entities that develop standards.  The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN\
    \ Standards\n   Committee is a sponsor that develops and maintains networking\n\
    \   standards and recommended practices for local, metropolitan, and\n   other\
    \ area networks, using an open and accredited process, while\n   advocating for\
    \ them on a global basis.  Areas of standardization work\n   include Ethernet,\
    \ Bridging and Virtual Bridged LANs, Wireless LAN\n   (Local Area Network), Wireless\
    \ PAN (Personal Area Network), Wireless\n   MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), Wireless\
    \ Coexistence, Media\n   Independent Handover Services, and Wireless RAN (Regional\
    \ Access\n   Network).  Within IEEE 802, a Working Group provides the focus for\n\
    \   each of these areas.\n   In IEEE 802, work is done in Working Groups operating\
    \ under an\n   Executive Committee.  Each Working Group is led by a Working Group\n\
    \   Chair.  Most Working Groups have one or more Task Groups.  A Task\n   Group\
    \ is responsible for a project or group of projects.\n   The Executive Committee\
    \ is comprised of the Executive Committee\n   Chair, Executive Committee Officers\
    \ (e.g., Vice-Chairs, Secretaries,\n   Treasurer), and Working Group Chairs.\n\
    \   A good place to learn more is the IEEE 802 Home Page, at\n   <http://www.ieee802.org/>.\
    \  An IEEE 802 Orientation for new\n   participants that gives an overview of\
    \ IEEE 802 process is available\n   from the home page.\n   The IEEE 802 Executive\
    \ Committee and all Working Groups meet three\n   times per year at plenary sessions.\
    \  Plenary sessions are held in\n   March, July, and November.  Most Working Groups\
    \ hold interim\n   meetings, usually in January, May, and September.  The meeting\n\
    \   schedule can be found at <http://www.ieee802.org/meeting/index.html>.\n  \
    \ A Study Group is a group formed to consider starting a new project\n   and,\
    \ if new work is found to be suitable, to develop an IEEE Project\n   Authorization\
    \ Request (PAR), similar in purpose to an IETF Working\n   Group charter.  A Study\
    \ Group may operate under a Working Group or\n   under the Executive Committee\
    \ depending on whether the new work under\n   consideration falls within the scope\
    \ of an existing Working Group.\n   Study Groups are expected to exist for a limited\
    \ time, usually for\n   one or two plenary cycles, and must be authorized to continue\
    \ at each\n   plenary if they have not completed their work.\n   Participation\
    \ in IEEE 802 Working Groups is at the level of\n   individuals -- participants\
    \ are human beings and not companies.\n   While participation is open, individuals\
    \ are required to declare\n   their affiliation (i.e., any individual or entity\
    \ that financially or\n   materially supports the individual's participation in\
    \ IEEE 802).\n   Working Groups maintain membership rosters, with voting membership\n\
    \   attained on the basis of in-person meeting attendance.  Retention of\n   voting\
    \ membership generally requires continued attendance and\n   responsiveness to\
    \ letter ballots.  Voting membership allows one to\n   vote on motions and on\
    \ Working Group Ballots of drafts.  All drafts\n   are also balloted by a Sponsor\
    \ ballot pool before approval as\n   standards.  Joining a Sponsor ballot pool\
    \ does not require\n   participation in meetings.  It is not necessary to be eligible\
    \ to\n   vote in order to comment on drafts, and the Working Group is required\n\
    \   to consider and respond to all comments submitted during Working\n   Group\
    \ and Sponsor ballots.\n   To foster ongoing communication between IEEE 802 and\
    \ IETF, it is\n   important to identify and establish contact points within each\n\
    \   organization.  IEEE 802 contact points may include:\n   IEEE 802 Working Group\
    \ Chair:  An IEEE 802 Working Group chair is an\n         individual who is assigned\
    \ to lead the work of IEEE 802 in a\n         particular area.  IEEE 802 Working\
    \ Group chairs are elected by\n         the Working Group and confirmed by the\
    \ Executive Committee for\n         a two-year term.  The Working Group Chair\
    \ provides a stable\n         contact point for cooperation between the two organizations\
    \ for\n         a given topic.\n   IEEE 802 Task Group (or Task Force) Chair:\
    \  An IEEE 802 Task Group\n         chair is an individual who is assigned to\
    \ lead the work on a\n         specific project or group of projects within a\
    \ Working Group.\n         The Task Group Chair often serves for the duration\
    \ of a\n         project.  The Task Group Chair provides a stable contact point\n\
    \         for cooperation between the two organizations on a particular\n    \
    \     project.\n   IEEE 802 Study Group Chair:  An IEEE 802 Study Group Chair\
    \ is an\n         individual assigned to lead consideration of new work and\n\
    \         development of an IEEE 802 Project Authorization Request (PAR).\n  \
    \       The Study Group chair provides a stable contact point for\n         cooperation\
    \ between the two organizations on a study group\n         topic.\n   IEEE 802\
    \ Liaisons:  It may be beneficial to establish liaisons as\n         additional\
    \ contact points for specific topics of mutual\n         interest.  These contact\
    \ points should be established early in\n         the work effort.  The IEEE 802\
    \ and IETF projects may select the\n         same individual as their contact\
    \ point, but this is not\n         required, so that two individuals each serve\
    \ as contact points\n         for one project participating in the liaison relationship.\n\
    \   Informal Contact points:  Other informal contacts can provide useful\n   \
    \      cooperation points.  These include Project Editors who are\n         responsible\
    \ for editing the drafts and work with the Task Group\n         Chairs to lead\
    \ tracking and resolution of issues.  Joint\n         members who are active in\
    \ both the IEEE 802 and IETF projects\n         in an area can also aid in cooperation.\n"
- title: 2.2.  IETF
  contents:
  - "2.2.  IETF\n   The IETF Standards Process is defined in [BCP9].  [BCP11] is a\n\
    \   helpful description of organizations involved in the IETF standards\n   process.\
    \  It can still be useful as an overview, although details\n   have changed since\
    \ 1996.\n   In the IETF, work is done in Working Groups (WGs) and is mostly\n\
    \   carried out through open, public mailing lists rather than face-to-\n   face\
    \ meetings.  The IETF Working Group process is defined in [BCP25].\n   WGs are\
    \ organized into areas, and each area is managed by one or more\n   Area Directors.\
    \  Collectively, the Area Directors constitute the\n   Internet Engineering Steering\
    \ Group (IESG) [RFC3710].\n   To foster ongoing communication between IEEE 802\
    \ and IETF, it is\n   important to identify and establish contact points within\
    \ each\n   organization.  IETF contact points may include Area Directors,\n  \
    \ Working Group chairs, and other points of contact who can help\n   communicate\
    \ between IEEE 802 and IETF Working Groups.\n   The Internet Architecture Board\
    \ (IAB) charter [BCP39] assigns the IAB\n   several responsibilities relevant\
    \ to this document:\n      1.  IESG Appointment Confirmation [BCP10]\n      2.\
    \  Architectural Oversight\n      3.  Standards Process Oversight and Appeal\n\
    \      4.  Appointment of the RFC Series Editor [RFC6635] and Independent\n  \
    \        Submission Editor [RFC6548]\n      5.  Appointment of the Internet Assigned\
    \ Number Authority (IANA)\n          operator [RFC6220]\n      6.  Oversight of\
    \ External Liaisons for the IETF [BCP102]\n   IESG and IAB members are selected\
    \ using the NomCom process defined in\n   [BCP10].  Working Group chairs serve\
    \ at the pleasure of their Area\n   Directors, as described in [BCP25].\n   The\
    \ IETF is designed to be a \"bottom-up\" protocol engineering\n   organization\
    \ -- the leadership steers and manages but does not direct\n   work in a top-down\
    \ way.  Technical agreements with \"the IETF\" are\n   based on the consensus\
    \ of Working Group participants, rather than\n   negotiated with IETF leadership.\n\
    \   IETF meets in plenary sessions three times per year.  Some Working\n   Groups\
    \ schedule additional interim meetings, which may be either\n   face-to-face or\
    \ \"virtual\".  Information about IETF meetings is\n   available at <http://www.ietf.org/meeting/upcoming.html>.\n\
    \   Information about IETF Working Group interim meetings is available on\n  \
    \ <http://www.ietf.org/meeting/interim-meetings.html>.\n   The preferred way to\
    \ develop specifications is to do work on mailing\n   lists, reserving face-to-face\
    \ sessions for topics that have not been\n   resolved through previous mailing\
    \ list discussion.\n   Participation in the IETF is open to anyone (technically,\
    \ anyone with\n   access to email sufficient to allow subscription to one or more\
    \ IETF\n   mailing lists).  All IETF participants act as individuals.  There is\n\
    \   no concept of \"IETF membership\".\n   A good place to learn more is the IETF\
    \ Home Page, at\n   <http://www.ietf.org/>, and especially the \"About the IETF\"\
    \ page at\n   <http://www.ietf.org/about>, selectable from the IETF Home Page.\n\
    \   The \"Tao of the IETF\" is also very helpful, especially for IEEE 802\n  \
    \ participants who will also be participating in IETF Working Groups\n   and attending\
    \ IETF meetings.  It is available at\n   <http://www.ietf.org/tao.html>.\n   The\
    \ current list of IETF Area Directors and Working Group chairs can\n   be found\
    \ in the IETF Working Group charters, at\n   <http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/>.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Structural Differences
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Structural Differences\n   IEEE 802 and IETF have similar structures, but\
    \ the terms they use are\n   different, and even conflicting.  For example, both\
    \ IEEE 802 and IETF\n   use the term \"Working Group\", but this means very different\
    \ things in\n   the two organizations.\n   Thumbnail comparison between IETF and\
    \ IEEE 802 entities\n   IETF Area           is similar to  IEEE 802 Working Group\n\
    \   IETF Working Group  is similar to  IEEE 802 Task Group\n   IETF BOF      \
    \      is similar to  IEEE 802 Study Group\n   Both IEEE 802 Working Groups and\
    \ IETF Areas are large, long-lived,\n   and relatively broadly scoped, containing\
    \ more narrowly chartered\n   entities (IEEE 802 Task Groups and IETF Working\
    \ Groups), which tend\n   to be short-lived and narrowly chartered.  IEEE 802\

    \  IEEE 802 does not have\n   a corresponding organizational entity.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Cultural Differences
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Cultural Differences\n   IEEE 802 and IETF have cultures that are similar\
    \ but not identical.\n   Some of the differences include:\n   Consensus and Rough\
    \ Consensus:  Both organizations make decisions\n         based on consensus,\
    \ but in the IETF, \"consensus\" can mean\n         \"rough consensus, as determined\
    \ by Working Group chairs\".  In\n         practice, this means that a large part\
    \ of the community being\n         asked needs to agree.  Not everyone has to\
    \ agree, but if\n         someone disagrees, they need to convince other people\
    \ of their\n         point of view.  If they're not able to do that, they'll be\
    \ \"in\n         the rough\" when \"rough consensus\" is declared.  Although IEEE\n\
    \         Working Groups ultimately rely on voting for decision-making,\n    \
    \     they vary widely in their use of consensus versus voting in the\n      \
    \   course of a meeting and in their attention to Robert's Rules\n         [RONR].\n\
    \   Running Code:  David Clark coined the phrase \"We reject kings,\n        \
    \ presidents and voting.  We believe in rough consensus and\n         running\
    \ code\" in 1992, to explain IETF culture.  Although\n         that's not always\
    \ true today, the existence of \"running code\"\n         as a proof of feasibility\
    \ for a proposal often carries weight\n         during technical discussions.\
    \  IEEE 802 considers both\n         technical and economic feasibility when deciding\
    \ whether to\n         approve new work, as noted in Section 4.1.7.\n   Decision-making:\
    \ IEEE 802 Working Groups vary in their reliance upon\n         voting versus\
    \ consensus, and in the breadth of coverage of an\n         individual motion,\
    \ but ultimately, all rely upon a 75 percent\n         vote to decide technical\
    \ issues, and a 50 percent +1 vote to\n         decide other issues.  IETF Working\
    \ Groups do not use voting.\n         Working Group chairs may ask for a \"show\
    \ of hands\" or \"take a\n         hum\" to judge backing for a proposal and identify\
    \ technical\n         concerns and objections, but this is not considered \"voting\"\
    .\n         IETF consensus and humming is discussed further in [RFC7282].\n  \
    \ Balance between mailing lists and meetings:  Both organizations make\n     \
    \    use of mailing lists.  IETF Working Groups rely heavily on\n         mailing\
    \ lists, where work is done, in addition to formal\n         meetings.  The IETF\
    \ requires all Working Group decisions to be\n         made (or, often in practice,\
    \ confirmed) on mailing lists --\n         final decisions aren't made in meetings.\
    \  IEEE 802 Working\n         Groups typically meet face-to-face about twice as\
    \ often as IETF\n         Working Groups (three IEEE 802 plenaries plus three\
    \ IETF 802\n         interim meetings each year, compared to three IETF plenaries\n\
    \         per year), and teleconferences are more common in IEEE 802 than\n  \
    \       in most IETF Working Groups.  Most major decisions in IEEE 802\n     \
    \    are made during plenary or interim meetings, except for\n         procedural\
    \ decisions.  Attendance at meetings is critical to\n         influencing decisions\
    \ and to maintaining membership voting\n         rights.\n   Interim meetings:\
    \  Both organizations use interim meetings (between\n         plenary meetings).\
    \  IETF Working Groups schedule interim\n         meetings on an as-needed basis.\
    \  IETF interim meetings may be\n         face-to-face or virtual.  Most IEEE\
    \ 802 WGs hold regularly\n         interim meetings three times a year in the\
    \ middle of the\n         interval between two plenary meetings.  The schedules\
    \ and\n         locations of these meetings are typically known many months in\n\

    \      addition to regularly scheduled IEEE 802 interim meetings,\n         teleconference\
    \ and ad hoc meetings are held on an as-needed\n         basis.\n   Remote participation:\
    \  Because the IETF doesn't make decisions at\n         face-to-face meetings,\
    \ attendance is not absolutely necessary,\n         and some significant contributors\
    \ do not attend most face-to-\n         face IETF meetings.  However, finding\
    \ people interested in a\n         proposal for new work, or soliciting backing\
    \ for ideas, is\n         often more easily accomplished face-to-face, such as\
    \ in a\n         hallway or bar.  Significant contributors to IEEE 802 almost\n\
    \         always attend face-to-face meetings;  participation in IEEE 802\n  \
    \       meetings is a condition for WG membership.\n   Lifetime of Standards:\
    \  IEEE 802 periodically reviews existing\n         standards.  IETF Standards\
    \ Track documents may be updated or\n         obsoleted by newer Standards Track\
    \ documents, but there is no\n         formal periodic review for existing Standards\
    \ Track documents.\n         The status of specific IETF standards is available\
    \ through the\n         IETF \"Datatracker\" [DATATRACKER].  Because these status\
    \ changes\n         happen independently, standards from each organization may\n\
    \         refer to documents that are no longer standards in the other\n     \
    \    organization.\n   Overlapping terminology:  As two independent standards\
    \ development\n         organizations, IEEE 802 and IETF have developed vocabularies\n\
    \         that overlap.  For instance, IEEE 802 \"ballots\" at several\n     \
    \    levels of the organization during document approval, while IETF\n       \
    \  documents are only \"balloted\" during IESG review.  The IESG\n         uses\
    \ \"ballots\" to indicate that all technical concerns have\n         been addressed,\
    \ not to indicate that the IESG agrees with a\n         document.  The intention\
    \ is to \"discuss\" technical issues with\n         a document, and \"no\" is\
    \ not one of the choices on an IESG\n         ballot.\n"

    \   IETF specifications may reference IEEE 802 work in progress, but\n   these\
    \ references should be labeled \"Work in Progress\".  If the\n   references are\
    \ normative, this will block publication of the\n   referring specification until\
    \ the reference is available in a stable\n   form.\n   IEEE 802 standards may\
    \ normatively reference non-expired Internet-\n   Drafts, but IEEE 802 prefers\
    \ that this be avoided if at all possible.\n   Informative references in IEEE\
    \ 802 standards are placed in a\n   bibliography, so they may point to either\
    \ approved IETF standards or\n   IETF Internet-Drafts, if necessary.\n   When\
    \ an IEEE 802 standard is revised, it normally retains the same\n   number and\
    \ the date is updated.  Therefore, IEEE 802 standards are\n   dated with the year\
    \ of approval, e.g., IEEE Std 802.1Q(TM)-2011.\n   There are two ways of referencing\
    \ IEEE 802 standards: undated and\n   dated references.  IEEE 802 practice allows\
    \ undated reference to be\n   used when referencing a whole standard.  An undated\
    \ reference\n   indicates that the most recent version of the standard should\
    \ be\n   used.  A dated reference refers to a specific revision of an IEEE 802\n\
    \   standard.  Since clauses, subclauses, tables, figures, etc., may be\n   renumbered\
    \ when a standard is revised, a dated reference should be\n   used when citing\
    \ specific items in a standard.\n   IETF standards may be cited by RFC number,\
    \ which would also be a\n   dated reference.  If an undated reference to an IETF\
    \ Internet\n   Standard is desired, a number is also assigned in the \"STD\" series\n\
    \   [BCP9], and these references refer to the most recent version of an\n   IETF\

    \ IETF may agree to use additional\n   mechanisms for coordination between the\
    \ two groups.  The details of\n   these mechanisms may vary over time, but the\
    \ overarching goal is to\n   communicate effectively as needed.\n   As examples\
    \ of such mechanisms, at the time this document was\n   written, the two organizations\
    \ are holding periodic conference calls\n   between representatives of the IETF\
    \ and IEEE 802 leadership teams,\n   and are maintaining a \"living list\" of\
    \ shared interests between the\n   two organizations, along with the status of\
    \ these interests and any\n   related action items.  At the time this document\
    \ was written, the\n   \"living list\" included about 20 topics being actively\
    \ discussed, with\n   more expected.  These conference calls help the two organizations\n\
    \   coordinate more effectively by allowing higher-bandwidth discussions\n   than\
    \ formal liaison statements would allow and by permitting more\n   timely interactions\
    \ than waiting for face-to-face meetings.\n   Minutes for these conference calls,\
    \ and the \"living lists\" discussed\n   on each call, are available at <http://www.iab.org/activities/\n\

    \ is defined in [BCP25].  The overall\n   IETF standards process is defined in\
    \ [BCP9].\n   As noted in Section 2.4, IETF Working Groups do not \"ballot\" to\n\
    \   determine Working Group consensus to forward documents to the IESG\n   for\
    \ approval.\n   Technical contributions are welcome at any point in the IETF document\n\
    \   review and approval process, but there are some points where\n   contribution\
    \ is more likely to be effective.\n   1.  When a Working Group is considering\
    \ adoption of an individual\n       draft.  Adoption is often announced on the\
    \ Working Group's\n       mailing list.\n   2.  When Working Group chairs issue\
    \ a \"Working Group Last Call\"\n       (\"WGLC\") for a draft, to confirm that\
    \ the Working Group has\n       consensus to request publication.  Although this\
    \ is not a\n       mandatory step in the document review and approval process\
    \ for\n       Internet-Drafts, most IETF Working Groups do issue WGLCs for most\n\
    \       Working Group documents.  WGLC would be announced on the Working\n   \
    \    Group's mailing list.\n   3.  When the Internet Engineering Steering Group\
    \ issues an \"IETF Last\n       Call\" (\"Last Call\") for a draft.  IETF Last\
    \ Call is a formal and\n       required part of the review and approval process,\
    \ is addressed to\n       the larger IETF community, and is often the first time\
    \ the entire\n       community has looked at the document.  IETF Last Call is\
    \ signaled\n       on the IETF-Announce Mailing List, and comments and feedback\
    \ are\n       ordinarily directed to the IETF Discussion Mailing List.\n   In\
    \ practice, earlier input is more likely to be effective input.\n   IEEE 802 participants\
    \ who are interested in work within the IETF\n   should be monitoring that work\
    \ and providing input long before\n   Working Group Last Calls and IETF Last Calls,\
    \ for best results.\n   Some IETF Working Group charters direct the Working Group\

    \ MIB\n   modules and AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)\n  \

    \ of documents in IESG review (examples include\n   security, \"MIB Doctors\"\
    , or congestion management reviews).  Area\n   Directors may also require solicited\
    \ reviews from IEEE 802 or IEEE\n   802 Working Groups when it becomes clear that\
    \ the Internet-Draft has\n   implications that impact some area of IEEE 802's\

  - "5.  Liaison Managers and Liaison Statements\n   Both IEEE 802 and IETF work best\

    \ effective\n   communication between the two SDOs.  From time to time, it may\
    \ be\n   appropriate for a technical body in one SDO to communicate as a body\n\
    \   with a technical body in the other SDO.  This section describes the\n   mechanisms\
    \ used to provide formal communication between the two\n   organizations, should\
    \ that become necessary.\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is responsible\
    \ for liaison\n   relationship oversight for the IETF.  In IEEE 802, liaison\n\
    \   relationship oversight is distributed, and each organization\n   appointing\
    \ liaison managers is responsible for oversight of its own\n   liaison relationships.\n\
    \   The reader should note that the role of a liaison manager in both\n   IEEE\
    \ 802 and IETF is not to \"speak for\" the appointing organization.\n   A liaison\
    \ manager is most helpful in ensuring that neither\n   organization is surprised\
    \ by what's happening in the other\n   organization, helping to identify the right\
    \ people to be talking to\n   in each organization, and making sure that formal\
    \ liaison statements\n   don't \"get lost\" between the two organizations.  The\
    \ IAB's guidance\n   to liaison managers is available in [RFC4691].  IEEE 802\n\

- title: 6.1.  IANA
  contents:
  - "6.1.  IANA\n   The IETF uses the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as\
    \ a\n   central authority that administers registries for most protocol\n   parameter\
    \ allocations.  The overarching document describing this is\n   [BCP26].  [BCP141]\
    \ discusses use of IEEE 802-specific IANA parameters\n   in IETF protocols and\
    \ specifies IANA considerations for allocation of\n   code points under the IANA\
    \ OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier).\n   Requests for protocol parameter\
    \ allocations from IANA are subject to\n   assignment policies, and these policies\
    \ vary from registry to\n   registry.  A variety of well-known policies are described\
    \ in [BCP26],\n   but registries are not limited to one of the well-known choices.\n\
    \   The purpose of these allocations is to manage a namespace\n   appropriately,\
    \ so unless a registry has a policy that allows\n   something like first come,\
    \ first served (\"FCFS\") for a namespace that\n   is effectively unbounded, requests\
    \ for protocol parameter allocation\n   will require some level of review.  \"\
    Standards Action\" is at the\n   other extreme (an approved Standards Track RFC\
    \ is required in order\n   to obtain an allocation).  Some registries require\
    \ that a request for\n   allocation pass \"Expert Review\" -- review by someone\

    \   Regarding Ethertype allocation:\n   Some IETF protocol specifications make\

    \ has the following\n   requirements.  All Ethertype requests are subject to review\
    \ by a\n   consultant to the IEEE RA, followed by IEEE RAC confirmation.\n   The\
    \ IEEE RAC will not assign a new Ethertype to a new IETF protocol\n   specification\
    \ until the IESG has approved the protocol specification\n   for publication as\

- title: A.1.  MIB Review
  contents:
  - "A.1.  MIB Review\n   Historically, the MIB modules for IEEE 802.1 and IEEE 802.3\
    \ were\n   developed in the IETF Bridge MIB and Hub MIB Working Groups,\n   respectively.\
    \  With travel budgets under pressure, it has become\n   increasingly difficult\
    \ for companies to fund employees to attend both\n   IEEE 802 and IETF meetings.\n\
    \   As a result, an alternative was found to past arrangements that\n   involved\
    \ chartering MIB work items within an IETF WG.  Instead, the\n   work was transferred\
    \ to IEEE 802 with expert support for MIB review\n   from the IETF.  The process\
    \ of transfer of the MIB work from the IETF\n   Bridge MIB WG to IEEE 802.1 WG\
    \ is documented in [RFC4663].\n   By standardizing IEEE 802 MIBs only within IEEE\
    \ 802 while utilizing\n   the IETF SNMP quality control process, the IETF and\
    \ IEEE 802 seek to\n   ensure quality while decreasing overhead.  In order to\
    \ encourage\n   wider review of MIBs developed by IEEE 802 WGs, it is recommended\n\
    \   that MIB modules developed in IEEE 802 follow the MIB guidelines\n   [BCP111].\
    \  An IEEE 802 group may request assignment of a \"MIB Doctor\"\n   to assist\
    \ in a MIB review by contacting the IETF Operations and\n   Management Area Director.\n"
- title: A.2.  AAA Review
  contents:
  - "A.2.  AAA Review\n   IEEE 802 WGs requiring new AAA applications should send\
    \ a liaison\n   request to the IETF.  Where new attribute definitions are sufficient,\n\
    \   rather than defining new authentication, authorization, and\n   accounting\
    \ logic and procedures, an Internet-Draft can be submitted\n   and review can\
    \ be requested from AAA-related WGs such as the RADEXT\n   or DIME WGs.\n   In\
    \ addition to the RADEXT and DIME WGs, a \"AAA doctors\" team\n   (directorate)\
    \ is currently active in the OPS Area and can be\n   consulted for more general\
    \ advice on AAA issues that cross the limits\n   of one or the other of the RADIUS\
    \ or Diameter protocols, or are more\n   generic in nature.\n   For attributes\
    \ of general utility, particularly those useful in\n   multiple potential applications,\
    \ allocation from the IETF standard\n   attribute space is preferred to creation\
    \ of IEEE 802 Vendor-Specific\n   Attributes (VSAs).  As noted in [RFC3575]: \"\
    RADIUS defines a\n   mechanism for Vendor-Specific extensions (Attribute 26) for\
    \ functions\n   specific only to one vendor's implementation of RADIUS, where\
    \ no\n   interoperability is deemed useful.  For functions specific only to\n\
    \   one vendor's implementation of RADIUS, the use of that should be\n   encouraged\
    \ instead of the allocation of global attribute types.\"\n   Where allocation\
    \ of VSAs are required, it is recommended that IEEE\n   802 create a uniform format\
    \ for all of IEEE 802, rather than having\n   each IEEE 802 Working Group create\
    \ their own VSA format.  The VSA\n   format defined in [IEEE80211F] is inappropriate\
    \ for this, since the\n   Type field is only a single octet, allowing for only\
    \ 255 attributes.\n   It is recommended that IEEE 802 Working Groups read and\
    \ follow the\n   recommendations in \"RADIUS Design Guidelines\" [BCP158] and\
    \ \"Protocol\n   Extensions\" [RFC6929] when designing and reviewing new extensions\
    \ and\n   attributes.\n   \"Diameter Applications Design Guidelines\" [DADG] explains\
    \ and\n   clarifies the rules to extend the Diameter base protocol [RFC6733].\n\
    \   Extending Diameter can mean either the definition of a completely new\n  \
    \ Diameter application or the reuse of commands, Attribute-Value Pairs\n   (AVPs),\
    \ and AVP values in any combination for the purpose of\n   inheriting the features\
    \ of an existing Diameter application.  The\n   recommendation for reusing existing\
    \ applications as much as possible\n   is meaningful as most of the requirements\
    \ defined for a new\n   application are likely already fulfilled by existing applications.\n\
    \   It is recommended that IEEE 802 Working Groups read and follow the\n   recommendations\
    \ in [DADG] when defining and reviewing new extensions\n   and attributes.\n"
- title: A.3.  EAP Review
  contents:
  - "A.3.  EAP Review\n   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in\
    \ [RFC3748],\n   provides a framework within which authentication mechanisms,\
    \ known as\n   methods, can be defined.  In addition to supporting authentication,\n\
    \   EAP also provides for key derivation as described in [RFC5247].\n   State\
    \ machines for EAP are described in [RFC4137].\n   As noted in [BCP132] and [RFC5247],\
    \ security issues can arise in\n   integration of EAP within lower layers.  Therefore,\
    \ it is recommended\n   that IEEE 802 WGs looking to incorporate support for EAP\
    \ send a\n   liaison request to the IETF, requesting assistance in carrying out\
    \ a\n   security review.  As an example, a security review of IEEE 802.16 was\n\
    \   carried out by the EAP WG, at the request of IEEE 802.16\n   [IEEE-802.16-Liaison1]\
    \ [IEEE-802.16-Liaison2].  Where development of\n   new EAP authentication methods\
    \ is sufficient, an Internet-Draft can\n   be submitted and review can be requested\
    \ from WGs such as the EAP\n   Method Update (EMU) WG.\n"
