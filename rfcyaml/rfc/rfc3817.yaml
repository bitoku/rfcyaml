  - "1.  Introduction\n   PPPoE [1] is often deployed in conjunction with L2TP [2]\
    \ to carry PPP\n   [3] frames over a network beyond the reach of the local Ethernet\n\
    \   network to which a PPPoE Host is connected.  For example, PPP frames\n   tunneled\
    \ within PPPoE may be received by an L2TP Access Concentrator\n   (LAC) and then\
    \ tunneled to any L2TP Network Server (LNS) reachable\n   via an IP network.\n\
    \   In addition to tunneling PPP over Ethernet, PPPoE defines a simple\n   method\
    \ for discovering services offered by PPPoE Access Concentrators\n   (PPPoE AC)\
    \ reachable via Ethernet from the PPPoE Host.  Since the\n   packets used in this\
    \ exchange are not carried over PPP, they are not\n   tunneled with the PPP packets\
    \ over L2TP, thus the discovery\n   negotiation cannot extend past the LAC without\
    \ adding functionality.\n   This document describes a simple method for relaying\
    \ PPPoE Active\n   Discovery (PAD) messages over L2TP by extracting the PAD messages\
    \ and\n   sending them over the L2TP control channel.  After the completion of\n\
    \   setup through the processing of PAD messages, PPP packets arriving\n   via\
    \ PPPoE are then tunneled over L2TP in the usual manner as defined\n   in L2TP\
    \ [2].  Thus, there are no data plane changes required at the\n   LAC or LNS to\
    \ support this feature.  Also, by utilizing the L2TP\n   control channel, the\
    \ PPPoE discovery mechanism is transported to the\n   LNS reliably, before creation\
    \ of any L2TP sessions, and may take\n   advantage of any special treatment applied\
    \ to control messages in\n   transit or upon receipt.\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \
    \ \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [4].\n   When PPPoE PAD messages are received at a PPPoE Access\
    \ Concentrator,\n   the messages are passed over the L2TP control connection via\
    \ a newly\n   defined Service Relay Request Message (SRRQ) on an established tunnel\n\
    \   (Section 3.1).  When received, the PPPoE PAD message is processed at\n   the\
    \ L2TP node, or relayed to another L2TP node or PPPoE Access\n   Concentrator.\
    \  PPPoE PAD messages sent as replies are handled in a\n   similar manner over\
    \ a newly defined Service Relay Reply Message\n   (SRRP) (Section 3.2).\n"

  - "2.1.  PPPoE Active Discovery Stage\n   When a PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation\
    \ packet (PADI) is received by\n   an L2TP LAC that is providing PPPoE Service\
    \ Relay, the PADI MUST be\n   packaged in its entirety (including the Ethernet\
    \ MAC header) within\n   the PPPoE Relay AVP and transmitted over established\
    \ L2TP Control\n   Connection(s) associated with the interface on which the PADI\n\
    \   arrived.\n   The PPPoE Relay AVP is sent via the Service Relay Request Message\n\
    \   (SRRQ) defined in Section 3.  The SRRQ message MUST NOT be sent to an\n  \
    \ L2TP node which did not include the PPPoE Service Relay Response\n   Capability\
    \ AVP during control connection establishment.  If no\n   acceptable control connection\
    \ is available or cannot be created,\n   PPPoE PAD operation MUST be handled locally\
    \ by some means (including\n   intentionally ignoring the PPPoE PAD message, though\
    \ this must be a\n   deliberate act).\n   It is a matter of local policy as to\
    \ which control connections will\n   be established for relay and associated with\
    \ a given interface, and\n   when the Control Connections will be established.\
    \  For instance, an\n   implementation may \"nail up\" a control connection to\
    \ a particular\n   L2TP destination and associate the connection with an interface\
    \ over\n   which PPPoE PADI packets will arrive.  Alternatively, an\n   implementation\
    \ might dynamically establish a Control Connection to a\n   predetermined destination\
    \ upon receipt of a PADI, or upon receipt of\n   a PADI from a particular source.\n\
    \   Upon receipt of the SRRQ, the included PPPoE PADI message MUST be\n   processed\
    \ as described in [3], be relayed to another L2TP control\n   connection, or be\
    \ relayed to another PPPoE AC.\n   After processing of a PADI, any resultant PPPoE\
    \ Active Discovery\n   Offer packet (PADO) MUST be encapsulated in a PPPoE Relay\
    \ AVP and\n   delivered via the Service Relay Reply Message (SRRP) to the sender\
    \ of\n   the SRRQ.\n   Upon receipt of an SRRP message with relayed PADO, a LAC\
    \ MUST send\n   the encapsulated PADO message to the corresponding PPPoE Host.\
    \  The\n   source MAC address of the PADO message MUST be one which the LAC will\n\
    \   respond to, perhaps requiring substitution of its own MAC address.\n   In\
    \ each exchange above, the PPPoE Host-Uniq TAG or AC-Cookie TAG MUST\n   be used\
    \ as described in Section 2.3.\n   Following is an example of the PAD exchange\
    \ between a PPPoE Host, LAC\n   and LNS up to this point, assuming the L2TP Control\
    \ Connection has\n   already been established.  Examples that include AC-Cookie\
    \ TAG and\n   Host-Uniq TAG operation are included in the Appendix.\n      PPPoE\

  contents:
  - "2.2.  Session Establishment and Teardown\n   When a LAC that is providing the\
    \ PPPoE Service Relay feature receives\n   a valid PPPoE Active Discovery Request\
    \ packet (PADR), the LAC MUST\n   treat this as an action for creation of a Incoming\
    \ Call Request\n   (ICRQ) as defined in [2].  The resultant ICRQ message MUST\
    \ contain\n   the PPPoE Relay AVP containing the PADR in its entirety.\n   Upon\
    \ receipt of an L2TP ICRQ message, the LNS parses the PADR message\n   as described\
    \ in [3].  If this is an acceptable PPPoE service\n   connection (e.g., the Service-Name-Error\
    \ TAG would not be included in\n   a PPPoE Active Discovery Session-confirmation\
    \ packet (PADS)\n   response), the L2TP Incoming-Call-Reply (ICRP) message that\
    \ is sent\n   to the LAC includes the resultant PPPoE PADS encapsulated within\
    \ the\n   PPPoE Relay AVP.  If the service is unacceptable, the PADS with a\n\
    \   Service-Name-Error Tag is delivered via the Relay Session AVP within\n   a\
    \ Call-Disconnect-Notify (CDN) message, which also tears down the\n   L2TP session.\
    \  The PPPoE PADS SESSION_ID in the PPPoE Relay AVP MUST\n   always be zero as\
    \ it will be selected and filled in by the LAC.\n   Upon receipt of an ICRP with\
    \ the PPPoE Relay AVP, the LAC parses the\n   PADS from the AVP, inserts a valid\
    \ PPPoE SESSION_ID, and responds to\n   the PPPoE Host with the PADS.  The MAC\
    \ address of the PADS MUST be\n   the same one was utilized during the PADI/PADO\
    \ exchange described\n   above.  The LAC also completes the L2TP session establishment\
    \ by\n   sending an Incoming-Call-Connected (ICCN) to the LNS and binds the\n\
    \   L2TP session with the PPPoE session.  PPP data packets may now flow\n   between\
    \ the PPPoE session and the L2TP session in the traditional\n   manner.\n   If\
    \ the L2TP session is torn down for any reason, the LAC MUST send a\n   PPPoE\
    \ Active Discovery Terminate packet (PADT) to the host to\n   indicate that the\
    \ connection has been terminated.  This PADT MAY be\n   received from the LNS\
    \ via the PPPoE Relay AVP within a CDN message if\n   this was a graceful shutdown\
    \ initiated by the PPPoE subsystem at the\n   LNS.  As with the PADS, the SESSION_ID\
    \ in the PADT message is zero\n   until filled in with the proper SESSION_ID at\
    \ the LAC.\n   If the LAC receives a PADT from the PPPoE Host, the L2TP session\
    \ MUST\n   be shut down via the standard procedures defined in [2].  The PADT\n\
    \   MUST be sent in the CDN message to the LNS via the PPPoE Relay AVP.\n   If\
    \ the PPPoE system at the LNS disconnects the session, a PADT SHOULD\n   be sent\
    \ in the CDN.  In the event that the LAC receives a disconnect\n   from L2TP and\
    \ did not receive a PADT, it MUST generate a properly\n   formatted PADT and send\

- title: 2.3.  PPPoE PAD Message Exchange Coherency
  contents:
  - "2.3.  PPPoE PAD Message Exchange Coherency\n   PPPoE PAD messages will arrive\
    \ from multiple ethernet interfaces and\n   be relayed across multiple L2TP control\
    \ connections.  In order to\n   track which PAD messages must be sent where, we\
    \ utilize the Host-Uniq\n   TAG and AC-Cookie TAG.  Each are used in the same\
    \ manner, depending\n   on which PAD message is being sent or replied to.  Both\
    \ take\n   advantage of the fact that any PAD message sent as a reply to another\n\
    \   PAD message MUST echo these TAGs in their entirety [3].\n   For purposes of\
    \ this discussion, it is useful to define two\n   \"directions\" which PAD messages\
    \ will traverse during a relayed PPPoE\n   PAD message exchange.  Thus, for the\
    \ following example,\n                     \"Upstream\" ----------------------->\n\
    \            PPPoE Host ------ LAC ----- Tunnel Switch ------ LNS\n          \
    \           <--------------------- \"Downstream\"\n   PAD messages being sent\
    \ from the PPPoE Host, through the LAC, Tunnel\n   Switch, and LNS, are defined\
    \ to be traversing \"Upstream.\" PAD\n   messages being sent in the opposite direction\
    \ are defined to be\n   traversing \"Downstream.\"\n   Consider further, the following\
    \ observation for this example:\n   PAD messages that are sent Upstream: PADI,\
    \ PADR, PADT\n   PAD messages that are sent Downstream: PADO, PADS, PADT\n   Also,\
    \ there is a request/response connection between the PADI and\n   PADO which must\
    \ be linked with some common value.  Similarly, there\n   is a request/response\
    \ connection between PADO and PADR.  The PADS is\n   sent on its own with no response,\
    \ but must be delivered to the sender\n   of the PADR.  The PADT must be sent\
    \ with the same SESSION_ID as\n   established in the PADS.\n   The goal for PAD\
    \ message exchange coherency is to ensure that the\n   connections between the\
    \ PADI/PADO, PADO/PADR, and PADR/PADS and\n   PADS/PADT all remain intact as the\
    \ PAD messages are relayed from node\n   to node.\n   The basic mechanism for\
    \ ensuring this for PADI, PADO, and PADR\n   messages is the AC-Cookie TAG and\
    \ Host-Uniq TAG.  Both of these TAGs\n   are defined as arbitrary data which must\
    \ be echoed in any message\n   sent as a response to another message.  This is\
    \ the key to tying\n   these PAD messages together at each hop.  The following\
    \ two rules\n   makes this possible:\n      For PAD messages that are sent Upstream,\
    \ a new Host-Uniq TAG MUST\n      be inserted at each relaying node before the\
    \ PAD message is\n      forwarded.  There SHOULD be at most one Host-Uniq TAG\
    \ per PAD\n      message.\n      For PAD messages being sent Downstream, a new\
    \ AC-Cookie TAG MUST\n      be inserted at each relaying node before the PAD message\
    \ is\n      forwarded.  There SHOULD be at most one AC-Cookie TAG per PAD\n  \
    \    message.  Additionally, for an LNS receiving multiple PAD messages\n    \
    \  from upstream, there SHOULD be at most one PAD message forwarded\n      downstream\
    \ per received SRRP Message.  In other words, there\n      SHOULD be exactly one\
    \ PPPoE Relay AVP per L2TP SRRP Message.\n   The exception here is the PADS, which\
    \ cannot carry an AC-Cookie TAG\n   (and, thankfully, doesn't need to), and the\
    \ PADT.  We will discuss\n   these later in this section.  Using the above rules,\
    \ PADI, PADO, and\n   PADR messages may be relayed through an arbitrary number\
    \ of nodes,\n   each inserting its own value to link a message response that it\
    \ might\n   receive.\n   In order to implement this exchange without tying up\
    \ resources at\n   each L2TP node, it is desirable to not require ephemeral state\
    \ at\n   each node waiting for a message response from each forwarded PAD\n  \
    \ message.  This is achievable if one is willing to be very intelligent\n   about\
    \ the values that will be sent in the PPPoE TAGs used for message\n   coherency.\
    \  Given that the TAGs are of arbitrary size and composition\n   and are always\
    \ echoed in their entirety, one may use the information\n   here to map any next\
    \ relay hop information.  For example, the L2TP\n   Tunnel ID (Control Connection\
    \ ID) could be encoded in the TAG in\n   order to identify where to relay the\
    \ message when it arrives.  If one\n   chooses this method, the encoding MUST\
    \ incorporate some method of\n   encryption and authentication of the value. \
    \ Note that this is a\n   relatively simple proposition given that it is only\
    \ the source of the\n   encrypted and data that will ever need to decrypt and\
    \ authenticate\n   the value upon receipt (thus, no key exchanges are necessary,\
    \ and any\n   of a myriad of algorithms may be chosen).  Note that individual\
    \ TAGs\n   MUST never exceed 255 octets in length, and the length of an entire\n\
    \   PPPoE message MUST never exceed the maximum segment size of the\n   underlying\
    \ ethernet.  In the event that a TAG exceeds 255 octets in\n   length, a compression\
    \ scheme which may include storage of state at an\n   L2TP node may be necessary\
    \ before constructing a new TAG.\n   The PADS and PADT messages do not rely on\
    \ the AC-Cookie TAG or Host-\n   Uniq TAG for directing to the proper node.  As\
    \ described in Section\n   2.2, the L2TP session is created upon receipt of a\
    \ valid PADR at the\n   L2TP LAC.  Since the PADS is sent as an AVP on this message\
    \ exchange,\n   its coherency may be secured via the L2TP session itself.  Similarly\n\
    \   for the PADT, as it is carried in the L2TP disconnect message (CDN)\n   for\
    \ the L2TP session.\n   Clients are supposed to treat an AC-Cookie TAG as an opaque\
    \ object.\n   They differentiate PADOs only by MAC address, Service-Name TAG(s)\
    \ and\n   by AC-Name TAG(s).  If an LAC sends multiple PADOs, they should\n  \
    \ contain different AC-Name TAGs.\n   Furthermore, a node performing PPPoE L2TP\
    \ Relay (such as an LAC)\n   SHOULD attempt to distinguish or rate limit retransmitted\
    \ PADx\n   messages (perhaps via the source MAC address and/or arriving\n   interface\
    \ of the message) in order to limit the overloading of L2TP.\n   Examples of this\
    \ operation for a number of scenarios and\n   considerations for certain deployment\
    \ situations may be found in the\n   Appendix of this document.\n"

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   PPPoE has a number of known security weaknesses\
    \ that are not\n   described here.  For example, an intruder between a PPPoE Host\
    \ and a\n   PPPoE AC who can observe or modify PPPoE Active Discovery traffic\
    \ has\n   numerous opportunities for denial of service and other attacks.  The\n\
    \   use of the L2TP extensions described here makes it possible to tunnel\n  \
    \ PPPoE discovery packets between the LAC and LNS, extending the path\n   which\
    \ the PPPoE Active Discovery packets are transported.  There are\n   two possible\
    \ implications of this.  First, the tunneled packets may\n   now be observable\
    \ by an intruder having access to traffic along the\n   L2TP tunnel path.  This\
    \ MAY make information regarding service\n   offerings or host identity easier\
    \ to obtain to a rogue party given\n   that it is being sent over a wider variety\
    \ of media, and presumably\n   over a longer distance and/or more hops or administrative\
    \ domains.\n   Whether this information could be used for malicious purposes depends\n\
    \   on the information contained within, but it is conceivable that this\n   could\
    \ be sensitive information, and this mechanism increases the\n   possibility that\
    \ this information would be presented to an\n   interloper.  Second, it may also\
    \ be possible for an intruder to\n   modify PPPoE Active Discovery traffic while\
    \ it is being carried\n   within L2TP control messages.\n   There are at least\
    \ two methods defined to help thwart this inspection\n   or modification by an\
    \ unauthorized individual.  One of the two MUST\n   be used if the service discovery\
    \ information is considered to be\n   sensitive and is traversing an untrusted\
    \ network.  The first\n   suggested method is AVP hiding described in [2].  This\
    \ may be used to\n   hide the contents of the packets in transit, though offers\
    \ no\n   integrity protection against modification of data in the AVP.  The\n\
    \   second and more secure method is protecting L2TP with IPsec as\n   defined\
    \ in [6].\n"

  contents:
  - "Appendix A: PPPoE Relay in Point to Multipoint Environments\n   The PPPoE PADI\
    \ message in its native form, is sent as a broadcast\n   message on an Ethernet\
    \ link.  Thus, more than one AC concentrator\n   could conceivably receive and\
    \ respond to this message.  Similarly, a\n   PPPoE interface could be associated\
    \ with more than one L2TP Control\n   Connection, in order to query multiple LNSs\
    \ with potentially varying\n   service profiles, as well as to load balance requests.\n\
    \   As the PADI message is propagated, one may choose to replicate the\n   message\
    \ to multiple Control Connections in order to mimic the\n   behavior of the PADI\
    \ being sent on an ethernet link with multiple ACs\n   attached.  If the number\
    \ of replicated nodes is large, and the number\n   of hops deep, then an unmanageable\
    \ \"fan-out\" of PADI propagation may\n   occur.  Thus, care should be taken here\
    \ to only replicate messages to\n   multiple Control Connections when it is absolutely\
    \ necessary.\n   The only case where it is seems necessary to replicate messages\
    \ to\n   multiple destinations is in the case where each destination is known\n\
    \   to have varying service policies that all need to be advertised to a\n   PPPoE\
    \ Host for its gathering and selection.  At the time of this\n   writing, the\
    \ authors know of no PPPoE Host implementations that take\n   advantage of this\
    \ ability (instead, responding to only a single PPPoE\n   PADO).  This, of course,\
    \ is subject to change if and when PPPoE\n   implementations are advanced to this\
    \ stage.\n   In cases where multiple Control Connections may exist to multiple\n\
    \   LNSs for load balancing purposes, L2TP Service Relay should take\n   measures\
    \ to try one Control Connection at a time, rather than\n   broadcasting to all\
    \ Control Connections simultaneously.\n"
