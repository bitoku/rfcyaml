- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [1] provides a\n\
    \   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP\n   network.\
    \  Configuration parameters and other control information are\n   carried in tagged\
    \ data items that are stored in the \"options\" field\n   of the DHCP message.\
    \  The data items themselves are also called\n   \"options.\"\n   This document\
    \ specifies the current set of DHCP options.  This\n   document will be periodically\
    \ updated as new options are defined.\n    Each superseding document will include\
    \ the entire current list of\n   valid options.\n   All of the vendor information\
    \ extensions defined in RFC 1497 [2] may\n   be used as DHCP options.  The definitions\
    \ given in RFC 1497 are\n   included in this document, which supersedes RFC 1497.\
    \  All of the\n   DHCP options defined in this document, except for those specific\
    \ to\n   DHCP as defined in section 9, may be used as BOOTP vendor information\n\
    \   extensions.\n"

- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This document specifies options for use with both the Dynamic\
    \ Host\n   Configuration Protocol and the Bootstrap Protocol.\n   The full description\
    \ of DHCP packet formats may be found in the DHCP\n   specification document [1],\
    \ and the full description of BOOTP packet\n   formats may be found in the BOOTP\
    \ specification document [3].  This\n   document defines the format of information\
    \ in the last field of DHCP\n   packets ('options') and of BOOTP packets ('vend').\
    \  The remainder of\n   this section defines a generalized use of this area for\
    \ giving\n   information useful to a wide class of machines, operating systems\
    \ and\n   configurations. Sites with a single DHCP or BOOTP server that is\n \
    \  shared among heterogeneous clients may choose to define other, site-\n   specific\
    \ formats for the use of the 'options' field.\n   Section 2 of this memo describes\
    \ the formats of DHCP options and\n   BOOTP vendor extensions.  Section 3 describes\
    \ options defined in\n   previous documents for use with BOOTP (all may also be\
    \ used with\n   DHCP).  Sections 4-8 define new options intended for use with\
    \ both\n   DHCP and BOOTP. Section 9 defines options used only in DHCP.\n   References\
    \ further describing most of the options defined in sections\n   2-6 can be found\
    \ in section 12.  The use of the options defined in\n   section 9 is described\
    \ in the DHCP specification [1].\n   Information on registering new options is\
    \ contained in section 10.\n"
- title: 2. BOOTP Extension/DHCP Option Field Format
  contents:
  - "2. BOOTP Extension/DHCP Option Field Format\n   DHCP options have the same format\
    \ as the BOOTP \"vendor extensions\"\n   defined in RFC 1497 [2].  Options may\
    \ be fixed length or variable\n   length.  All options begin with a tag octet,\
    \ which uniquely\n   identifies the option.  Fixed-length options without data\
    \ consist of\n   only a tag octet.  Only options 0 and 255 are fixed length. \
    \ All\n   other options are variable-length with a length octet following the\n\
    \   tag octet.  The value of the length octet does not include the two\n   octets\
    \ specifying the tag and length.  The length octet is followed\n   by \"length\"\
    \ octets of data.  In the case of some variable-length\n   options the length\
    \ field is a constant but must still be specified.\n   Any options defined subsequent\
    \ to this document should contain a\n   length octet even if the length is fixed\
    \ or zero.\n   All multi-octet quantities are in network byte-order.\n   When\
    \ used with BOOTP, the first four octets of the vendor information\n   field have\
    \ been assigned to the \"magic cookie\" (as suggested in RFC\n   951).  This field\
    \ identifies the mode in which the succeeding data is\n   to be interpreted. \
    \ The value of the magic cookie is the 4 octet\n   dotted decimal 99.130.83.99\
    \ (or hexadecimal number 63.82.53.63) in\n   network byte order.\n   All of the\
    \ \"vendor extensions\" defined in RFC 1497 are also DHCP\n   options.\n   Option\
    \ codes 128 to 254 (decimal) are reserved for site-specific\n   options.\n   Except\
    \ for the options in section 9, all options may be used with\n   either DHCP or\
    \ BOOTP.\n   Many of these options have their default values specified in other\n\
    \   documents.  In particular, RFC 1122 [4] specifies default values for\n   most\
    \ IP and TCP configuration parameters.\n"
