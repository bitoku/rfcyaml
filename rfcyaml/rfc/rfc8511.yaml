- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms allow for burst tolerance\n\
    \   while enforcing short queues to minimise the time that packets spend\n   enqueued\
    \ at a bottleneck.  This can cause noticeable performance\n   degradation for\
    \ TCP connections traversing such a bottleneck,\n   especially if there are only\
    \ a few flows or their bandwidth-delay\n   product (BDP) is large.  The reception\
    \ of a Congestion Experienced\n   (CE) Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)\
    \ mark indicates that an\n   AQM mechanism is used at the bottleneck, and the\
    \ bottleneck network\n   queue is therefore likely to be short.  Feedback of this\
    \ signal\n   allows the TCP sender-side ECN reaction in congestion avoidance to\n\
    \   reduce the Congestion Window (cwnd) by a smaller amount than the\n   congestion\
    \ control algorithm's reaction to inferred packet loss.\n   Therefore, this specification\
    \ defines an experimental change to the\n   TCP reaction specified in RFC 3168,\
    \ as permitted by RFC 8311.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168] makes it\
    \ possible\n   for an Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism to signal the presence\n\
    \   of incipient congestion without necessarily incurring packet loss.\n   This\
    \ lets the network deliver some packets to an application that\n   would have\
    \ been dropped if the application or transport did not\n   support ECN.  This\
    \ packet loss reduction is the most obvious benefit\n   of ECN, but it is often\
    \ relatively modest.  Other benefits of\n   deploying ECN have been documented\
    \ in [RFC8087].\n   The rules for ECN were originally written to be very conservative,\n\
    \   and they required the congestion control algorithms of ECN-Capable\n   Transport\
    \ (ECT) protocols to treat indications of congestion\n   signalled by ECN exactly\
    \ the same as they would treat an inferred\n   packet loss [RFC3168].  Research\
    \ has demonstrated the benefits of\n   reducing network delays that are caused\
    \ by interaction of loss-based\n   TCP congestion control and excessive buffering\
    \ [BUFFERBLOAT].  This\n   has led to the creation of AQM mechanisms like Proportional\
    \ Integral\n   Controller Enhanced (PIE) [RFC8033] and Controlling Queue Delay\n\
    \   (CoDel) [RFC8289], which prevent bloated queues that are common with\n   unmanaged\
    \ and excessively large buffers deployed across the Internet\n   [BUFFERBLOAT].\n\
    \   The AQM mechanisms mentioned above aim to keep a sustained queue\n   short\
    \ while tolerating transient (short-term) packet bursts.\n   However, currently\
    \ used loss-based congestion control mechanisms are\n   not always able to effectively\
    \ utilise a bottleneck link where there\n   are short queues.  For example, a\
    \ TCP sender using the Reno\n   congestion control needs to be able to store at\
    \ least an end-to-end\n   bandwidth-delay product (BDP) worth of data at the bottleneck\
    \ buffer\n   if it is to maintain full path utilisation in the face of loss-\n\
    \   induced reduction of the congestion window (cwnd) [RFC5681].  This\n   amount\
    \ of buffering effectively doubles the amount of data that can\n   be in flight\
    \ and the maximum round-trip time (RTT) experienced by the\n   TCP sender.\n \
    \  Modern AQM mechanisms can use ECN to signal the early signs of\n   impending\
    \ queue buildup long before a tail-drop queue would be forced\n   to resort to\
    \ dropping packets.  It is therefore appropriate for the\n   transport protocol\
    \ congestion control algorithm to have a more\n   measured response when it receives\
    \ an indication with an early\n   warning of congestion after the remote endpoint\
    \ receives an ECN\n   CE-marked packet.  Recognizing these changes in modern AQM\
    \ practices,\n   the strict requirement that ECN CE signals be treated identically\
    \ to\n   inferred packet loss has been relaxed [RFC8311].  This document\n   therefore\
    \ defines a new sender-side-only congestion control response\n   called \"ABE\"\
    \ (Alternative Backoff with ECN).  ABE improves TCP's\n   average throughput when\
    \ routers use AQM-controlled buffers that allow\n   only for short queues.\n"

- title: 3.  Specification
  contents:
  - "3.  Specification\n   This specification changes the congestion control algorithm\
    \ of an\n   ECN-Capable TCP transport protocol by changing the TCP-sender\n  \
    \ response to feedback from the TCP receiver that indicates the\n   reception\
    \ of a CE-marked packet, i.e., receipt of a packet with the\n   ECN-Echo flag\
    \ (defined in [RFC3168]) set, following the process\n   defined in [RFC8311].\n\
    \   The TCP-sender response is currently specified in Section 6.1.2 of\n   the\
    \ ECN specification [RFC3168] and has been slightly updated by\n   Section 4.1\
    \ of [RFC8311] to read as:\n      The indication of congestion should be treated\
    \ just as a\n      congestion loss in non-ECN-Capable TCP.  That is, the TCP source\n\
    \      halves the congestion window \"cwnd\" and reduces the slow start\n    \
    \  threshold \"ssthresh\", unless otherwise specified by an\n      Experimental\
    \ RFC in the IETF document stream.\n   As permitted by RFC 8311, this document\
    \ specifies a sender-side\n   change to TCP where receipt of a packet with the\
    \ ECN-Echo flag SHOULD\n   trigger the TCP source to set the slow start threshold\
    \ (ssthresh) to\n   0.8 times the FlightSize, with a lower bound of 2 * SMSS applied\
    \ to\n   the result (where SMSS stands for Sender Maximum Segment Size)).  As\n\
    \   in [RFC5681], the TCP sender also reduces the cwnd value to no more\n   than\
    \ the new ssthresh value.  Section 6.1.2 of RFC 3168 provides\n   guidance on\
    \ setting a cwnd less than 2 * SMSS.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Choice of ABE Multiplier
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Choice of ABE Multiplier\n   ABE decouples the reaction of a TCP sender\
    \ to inferred packet loss\n   from the indication of ECN-signalled congestion\
    \ in the congestion\n   avoidance phase.  To achieve this, ABE uses a different\
    \ scaling\n   factor for Equation 4 in Section 3.1 of [RFC5681].  The description\n\
    \   respectively uses beta_{loss} and beta_{ecn} to refer to the\n   multiplicative\
    \ decrease factors applied in response to inferred\n   packet loss, and in response\
    \ to a receiver indicating ECN-signalled\n   congestion.  For non-ECN-enabled\
    \ TCP connections, only beta_{loss}\n   applies.\n   In other words, in response\
    \ to inferred packet loss:\n      ssthresh = max (FlightSize * beta_{loss}, 2\
    \ * SMSS)\n   and in response to an indication of an ECN-signalled congestion:\n\
    \      ssthresh = max (FlightSize * beta_{ecn}, 2 * SMSS)\n      and\n      cwnd\
    \ = ssthresh\n      (If ssthresh == 2 * SMSS, Section 6.1.2 of RFC 3168 provides\n\
    \      guidance on setting a cwnd lower than 2 * SMSS.)\n   where FlightSize is\
    \ the amount of outstanding data in the network,\n   upper-bounded by the smaller\
    \ of the sender's cwnd and the receiver's\n   advertised window (rwnd) [RFC5681].\
    \  The higher the values of\n   beta_{loss} and beta_{ecn}, the less aggressive\
    \ the response of any\n   individual backoff event.\n   The appropriate choice\
    \ for beta_{loss} and beta_{ecn} values is a\n   balancing act between path utilisation\
    \ and draining the bottleneck\n   queue.  More aggressive backoff (smaller beta_*)\
    \ risks the\n   underutilisation of the path, while less-aggressive backoff (larger\n\
    \   beta_*) can result in slower draining of the bottleneck queue.\n   The Internet\
    \ has already been running with at least two different\n   beta_{loss} values\
    \ for several years: the standard value is 0.5\n   [RFC5681], and the Linux implementation\
    \ of CUBIC [RFC8312] has used a\n   multiplier of 0.7 since kernel version 2.6.25\
    \ released in 2008.  ABE\n   does not change the value of beta_{loss} used by\
    \ current TCP\n   implementations.\n   The recommendation in this document specifies\
    \ a value of\n   beta_{ecn}=0.8.  This recommended beta_{ecn} value is only applicable\n\
    \   for the standard TCP congestion control [RFC5681].  The selection of\n   beta_{ecn}\
    \ enables tuning the response of a TCP connection to shallow\n   AQM-marking thresholds.\
    \  beta_{loss} characterizes the response of a\n   congestion control algorithm\
    \ to packet loss, i.e., exhaustion of\n   buffers (of unknown depth).  Different\
    \ values for beta_{loss} have\n   been suggested for TCP congestion control algorithms.\
    \  Consequently,\n   beta_{ecn} is likely to be an algorithm-specific parameter\
    \ rather\n   than a constant multiple of the algorithm's existing beta_{loss}.\n\
    \   A range of tests (Section IV of [ABE2017]) with NewReno and CUBIC\n   over\
    \ CoDel and PIE in lightly multiplexed scenarios have explored\n   this choice\
    \ of parameter.  The results of these tests indicate that\n   CUBIC connections\
    \ benefit from beta_{ecn} of 0.85 (cf.  beta_{loss} =\n   0.7), and NewReno connections\
    \ see improvements with beta_{ecn} in the\n   range 0.7 to 0.85 (cf. beta_{loss}\
    \ = 0.5).\n"
- title: 4.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "4.  Discussion\n   Much of the technical background for ABE can be found in [ABE2017],\n\
    \   which uses a mix of experiments, theory, and simulations with NewReno\n  \
    \ [RFC5681] and CUBIC [RFC8312] to evaluate its performance.  ABE was\n   shown\
    \ to present significant performance gains in lightly-multiplexed\n   (few concurrent\
    \ flows) scenarios, without losing the delay-reduction\n   benefits of deploying\
    \ CoDel or PIE.  The performance improvement is\n   achieved when reacting to\
    \ ECN-Echo in congestion avoidance (when\n   ssthresh > cwnd) by multiplying cwnd\
    \ and ssthresh with a value in the\n   range [0.7,0.85].  Applying ABE when cwnd\
    \ is smaller than or equal to\n   ssthresh is not currently recommended, but its\
    \ use in that scenario\n   may benefit from additional attention, experimentation,\
    \ and\n   specification.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Rationale for Using ECN to Vary the Degree of Backoff
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Rationale for Using ECN to Vary the Degree of Backoff\n   AQM mechanisms\
    \ such as CoDel [RFC8289] and PIE [RFC8033] set a delay\n   target in routers\
    \ and use congestion notifications to constrain the\n   queuing delays experienced\
    \ by packets rather than in response to\n   impending or actual bottleneck buffer\
    \ exhaustion.  With current\n   default delay targets, CoDel and PIE both effectively\
    \ emulate a\n   bottleneck with a short queue (Section II of [ABE2017]) while\
    \ also\n   allowing short traffic bursts into the queue.  This provides\n   acceptable\
    \ performance for TCP connections over a path with a low\n   BDP, or in highly\
    \ multiplexed scenarios (many concurrent transport\n   flows).  However, in a\
    \ lightly multiplexed case over a path with a\n   large BDP, conventional TCP\
    \ backoff leads to gaps in packet\n   transmission and underutilisation of the\
    \ path.\n   Instead of discarding packets, an AQM mechanism is allowed to mark\n\
    \   ECN-Capable packets with an ECN CE mark.  The reception of CE-mark\n   feedback\
    \ not only indicates congestion on the network path, it also\n   indicates that\
    \ an AQM mechanism exists at the bottleneck along the\n   path.  Therefore, the\
    \ CE mark likely came from a bottleneck with a\n   controlled short queue.  Reacting\
    \ differently to an ECN-signalled\n   congestion than to an inferred packet loss\
    \ can then yield the benefit\n   of a reduced backoff when queues are short. \
    \ Using ECN can also be\n   advantageous for several other reasons [RFC8087].\n\
    \   The idea of reacting differently to inferred packet loss and\n   detection\
    \ of an ECN-signalled congestion predates this specification,\n   e.g., previous\
    \ research proposed using ECN CE-marked feedback to\n   modify TCP congestion\
    \ control behaviour via a larger multiplicative\n   decrease factor in conjunction\
    \ with a smaller additive increase\n   factor [ICC2002].  The goal of this former\
    \ work was to operate across\n   AQM bottlenecks (using Random Early Detection\
    \ (RED)) that were not\n   necessarily configured to emulate a short queue.  (The\
    \ current usage\n   of RED as an Internet AQM method is limited [RFC7567].)\n"
- title: 4.2.  An RTT-Based Response to Indicated Congestion
  contents:
  - "4.2.  An RTT-Based Response to Indicated Congestion\n   This specification applies\
    \ to the use of ECN feedback as defined in\n   [RFC3168], which specifies a response\
    \ to indicated congestion that is\n   no more frequent than once per path round-trip\
    \ time.  Since ABE\n   responds to indicated congestion once per RTT, it does\
    \ not respond to\n   any further loss within the same RTT because an ABE sender\
    \ has\n   already reduced the congestion window.  If congestion persists after\n\
    \   such reduction, ABE continues to reduce the congestion window in each\n  \
    \ consecutive RTT.  This consecutive reduction can protect the network\n   against\
    \ long-standing unfairness in the case of AQM algorithms that\n   do not keep\
    \ a small average queue length.  The mechanism does not\n   rely on Accurate ECN\
    \ [ACC-ECN-FEEDBACK].\n   In contrast, transport protocol mechanisms can also\
    \ be designed to\n   utilise more frequent and detailed ECN feedback (e.g., Accurate\
    \ ECN\n   [ACC-ECN-FEEDBACK]), which then permit a congestion control response\n\
    \   that adjusts the sending rate more frequently.  Data Center TCP\n   (DCTCP)\
    \ [RFC8257] is an example of this approach.\n"
- title: 5.  ABE Deployment Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  ABE Deployment Requirements\n   This update is a sender-side-only change.\
    \  Like other changes to\n   congestion control algorithms, it does not require\
    \ any change to the\n   TCP receiver or to network devices.  It does not require\
    \ any ABE-\n   specific changes in routers or the use of Accurate ECN feedback\n\
    \   [ACC-ECN-FEEDBACK] by a receiver.\n   If the method is only deployed by some\
    \ senders, and not by others,\n   the senders using it can gain some advantage,\
    \ possibly at the expense\n   of other flows that do not use this updated method.\
    \  Because this\n   advantage applies only to ECN-marked packets and not to packet-loss\n\
    \   indications, an ECN-Capable bottleneck will still fall back to\n   dropping\
    \ packets if a TCP sender using ABE is too aggressive.  The\n   result is no different\
    \ than if the TCP sender were using traditional\n   loss-based congestion control.\n\
    \   When used with bottlenecks that do not support ECN marking, the\n   specification\
    \ does not modify the transport protocol.\n"
- title: 6.  ABE Experiment Goals
  contents:
  - "6.  ABE Experiment Goals\n   [RFC3168] states that the congestion control response\
    \ following an\n   indication of ECN-signalled congestion is the same as the response\
    \ to\n   a dropped packet.  [RFC8311] updates this specification to allow\n  \
    \ systems to provide a different behaviour when they experience ECN-\n   signalled\
    \ congestion rather than packet loss.  The present\n   specification defines such\
    \ an experiment and is an Experimental RFC.\n   We expect to propose it as a Standards-Track\
    \ document in the future.\n   The purpose of the Internet experiment is to collect\
    \ experience with\n   the deployment of ABE and confirm acceptable safety in deployed\n\
    \   networks that use this update to TCP congestion control.  To evaluate\n  \
    \ ABE, this experiment requires support in AQM routers for the ECN-\n   marking\
    \ of packets carrying the ECN-Capable Transport codepoint\n   ECT(0) [RFC3168].\n\
    \   The result of this Internet experiment ought to include an\n   investigation\
    \ of the implications of experiencing an ECN-CE mark\n   followed by loss within\
    \ the same RTT.  At the end of the experiment,\n   this will be reported to the\
    \ TCPM Working Group or the IESG.\n   ABE is implemented as a patch for Linux\
    \ and FreeBSD.  This is meant\n   for research and experimentation and is available\
    \ for download at\n   <https://heim.ifi.uio.no/michawe/research/abe/>.  This code\
    \ was used\n   to produce the test results that are reported in [ABE2017].  The\n\
    \   FreeBSD code was committed to the mainline kernel on March 19, 2018\n   [ABE-REVISION].\n"

    \ the\n   security considerations for ECN [RFC3168] still apply.\n   This is a\
    \ change to TCP congestion control with ECN that will\n   typically lead to a\
    \ change in the capacity achieved when flows share\n   a network bottleneck. \
    \ This could result in some flows receiving more\n   than their fair share of\
