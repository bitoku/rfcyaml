  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a new Relay Agent Subscriber-ID option for the\n
    \  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6).  The option\n   allows
    a DHCPv6 relay agent to associate a stable \"Subscriber-ID\"\n   with DHCPv6 client
    messages in a way that is independent of the\n   client and of the underlying
    physical network infrastructure.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   DHCPv6 [1] provides IP addresses and configuration information
    for\n   IPv6 clients.  It includes a relay agent capability, in which\n   processes
    within the network infrastructure receive multicast\n   messages from clients
    and relay them to DHCPv6 servers.  In some\n   network environments, it will be
    useful for the relay agent to add\n   information to the DHCPv6 message before
    relaying it.\n   The information that relay agents supply can also be used in
    the\n   server's decision-making about the addresses, delegated prefixes [2],\n
    \  and configuration parameters that the client is to receive.\n   In many service-provider
    environments, it is believed to be desirable\n   to associate some provider-specific
    information with clients' DHCPv6\n   messages that is independent of the physical
    network configuration\n   and that the relay agent has learned through some means
    that is\n   outside the scope of this memo.\n"

  - "2.  The Relay Agent Subscriber-ID Option\n   In complex service provider environments,
    there is a need to connect\n   a customer's DHCPv6 configuration with the customer's
    administrative\n   information.  The Relay Agent Subscriber-ID option carries
    a value\n   that can be independent of the physical network configuration through\n
    \  which the subscriber is connected.  This value complements, and might\n   well
    be used in addition to, the network-based information.  The\n   \"subscriber-id\"
    assigned by the provider is intended to be stable as\n   customers connect through
    different paths, and as network changes\n   occur.\n   The subscriber-id information
    allows the service provider to assign/\n   activate subscriber-specific actions;
    e.g., assignment of specific IP\n   addresses, prefixes, DNS configuration, trigger
    accounting, etc.\n   This option is de-coupled from the access network's physical\n
    \  structure, so a subscriber that moves from one access-point to\n   another,
    for example, would not require reconfiguration at the\n   service provider's DHCPv6
    servers.\n   The subscriber-id information is only intended for use within a\n
    \  single administrative domain and is only exchanged between the relay\n   agents
    and DHCPv6 servers within that domain.  Therefore, the format\n   and encoding
    of the data in the option is not standardized, and this\n   specification does
    not establish any semantic requirements on the\n   data.  This specification only
    defines the option for conveying this\n   information from relay agents to DHCPv6
    servers.\n   However, as the DHCPv4 Subscriber-ID suboption [3] specifies Network\n
    \  Virtual Terminal (NVT) American Standard Code for Information\n   Interchange
    (ASCII) [4] encoded data, in environments where both\n   DHCPv4 [5] and DHCPv6
    are being used, it may be beneficial to use\n   that encoding.\n   The format
    of the DHCPv6 Relay Agent Subscriber-ID option is shown\n   below:\n    0                   1

  - "4.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior\n   This option provides additional information to
    the DHCPv6 server.\n   The DHCPv6 server may use this information, if available,
    in addition\n   to other relay agent option data, other options included in the\n
    \  DHCPv6 client messages, and physical network topology information in\n   order
    to assign IP addresses, delegate prefixes, and/or other\n   configuration parameters
    to the client.  There is no special\n   additional processing for this option.\n
    \  There is no requirement that a server return this option and its data\n   in
    a RELAY-REPLY message.\n"

    between relay agents\n   and DHCPv6 servers, [1], Section 21.1, provides details
    on securing\n   DHCPv6 messages sent between servers and relay agents.  [1], Section\n
    \  23, provides general DHCPv6 security considerations.\n"
