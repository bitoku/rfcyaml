    - "1.2.  Security Policy and IPsec\n   Network-layer security now enjoys broad
      popularity as a tool for\n   protecting Internet traffic and resources.  Security
      at the network\n   layer can be used as a tool for at least two kinds of security\n
      \  architecture:\n   a) Security gateways.  Security gateways (including \"firewalls\")
      at\n      the edges of networks use IPsec [RFC-2401] to enforce access\n      control,
      protect the confidentiality and authenticity of network\n      traffic entering
      and leaving a network, and to provide gateway\n      services for virtual private
      networks (VPNs).\n   b) Secure end-to-end communication.  Hosts use IPsec to
      implement\n      host-level access control, to protect the confidentiality and\n
      \     authenticity of network traffic exchanged with the peer hosts with\n      which
      they communicate, and to join virtual private networks.\n   On one hand, IPsec
      provides an excellent basis for a very wide range\n   of protection schemes;
      on the other hand, this wide range of\n   applications for IPsec creates complex
      management tasks that become\n   especially difficult as networks scale up and
      require different\n   security policies, and are controlled by different entities,
      for\n   different kinds of traffic in different parts of the network.\n   As
      organizations deploy security gateways, the Internet divides into\n   heterogeneous
      regions that enforce different access and security\n   policies.  Yet it is
      often still necessary for hosts to communicate\n   across the network boundaries
      controlled by several different\n   policies.  The wide range of choices of
      cryptographic parameters (at\n   multiple protocol layers) complicates matters
      and introduces the need\n   for hosts and security gateways to identify and
      negotiate a set of\n   security parameters that meets each party's requirements.
      \ Even more\n   complexity arises as IPsec becomes the means through which firewalls\n
      \  enforce access control and VPN membership; two IPsec endpoints that\n   want
      to establish a security association must identify, not only the\n   mutually
      acceptable cryptographic parameters, but also exactly what\n   kind of access
      the combined security policy provides.\n   While the negotiation of cryptographic
      and other security parameters\n   for IPsec security associations (SAs) is supported
      by key management\n   protocols (e.g., ISAKMP [RFC-2408]), the IPsec key management
      layer\n   does not provide a scheme for managing, negotiating, or enforcing
      the\n   security policies under which SAs operate.\n   IPSP provides the framework
      for managing IPsec security policy,\n   negotiating security association (SA)
      parameters between IPsec\n   endpoints, and distributing authorization and policy
      information\n   among hosts that require the ability to communicate via IPsec.\n"
    title: 1.2.  Security Policy and IPsec
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  The IP Security Policy Problem Space\n   IPSP aims to provide a scalable,
    decentralized framework for\n   managing, discovering and negotiating the host
    and network IPsec\n   policies that govern access, authorization, cryptographic
    mechanisms,\n   confidentiality, data integrity, and other IPsec properties.\n
    \  The central problem solved by IPSP is that of controlling security\n   policy
    in a manner that is useful for the wide range of IPsec\n   applications and modes
    of operation.  In particular:\n      -  IPSP hosts may serve as IPsec endpoints,
    security gateways,\n         network management hubs, or a combination of these
    functions.\n         IPSP will manage end-users computers (which may be fixed\n
    \        workstations controlled by a single organization or mobile\n         laptops
    that require remote access to a corporate VPN),\n         firewalls (which provide
    different services and allow different\n         levels of access to different
    classes of traffic and users),\n         VPN routers (which support links to other
    VPNs that might be\n         controlled by a different organization's network
    policy), web\n         and other servers (which might provide different services\n
    \        depending on where a client request came from), and so on.\n      -  IPSP
    administration will be inherently heterogeneous and\n         decentralized.  A
    basic feature of IPsec is that two hosts can\n         establish a Security Association
    even though they might not\n         share a common security policy, or, indeed,
    trust one another\n         at all.  This property of IPsec becomes even more
    pronounced at\n         the higher level abstraction managed by IPSP.\n      -
    \ The SA parameters acceptable to any pair of hosts (operating\n         under
    different policies) will often not be specified in\n         advance.  IPSP will
    often have to negotiate and discover the\n         mutually-acceptable SA parameters
    on-the-fly when two hosts\n         attempt to create a new SA.\n      -  Some
    hosts will be governed by policies that are not directly\n         specified in
    the IPSP language.  For example, a host's IPsec\n         policy might be derived
    from a more comprehensive higher-layer\n         security policy managed by some
    other system.  Similarly, some\n         vendors might develop specialized (and
    proprietary) tools for\n         managing policy in their products.  In such cases,
    it is\n         necessary to derive an IPSP policy specification for only those\n
    \        aspects of a host's policy that involve interoperability with\n         other
    hosts running IPSP.\n      -  IPSP must scale to support complex policy administration\n
    \        schemes.  In even modest-size networks, one administrator must\n         often
    control policy remotely, and must have the ability to\n         change the policy
    on many different hosts at the same time.  In\n         larger networks (or those
    belonging to large organizations), a\n         host's policy might be governed
    by several different\n         authorities (e.g., several different departments
    might have the\n         authority to add users to a firewall or open access to
    new\n         services).  Different parts of a policy might be \"owned\" by\n
    \        different entities in a complex hierarchy.  IPSP must provide a\n         mechanism
    for delegating specific kinds of authority to\n         specific entities.\n      -
    \ The semantics of IPSP must be well defined, particularly with\n         respect
    to any security-critical aspects of the system.\n      -  IPSP must be secure,
    sound, and comprehensible.  It should be\n         possible to understand what
    an IPSP policy does; the difficulty\n         of understanding an IPSP policy
    should be somewhat proportional\n         to the complexity of the problem it
    solves.  It should also be\n         possible to have confidence that an IPSP
    policy does what it\n         claims, and that IPSP implementation is correct;\n
    \        architecturally, the security-critical parts of IPSP should be\n         small
    and well-specified enough to allow verification of their\n         correct operation.
    \ Ideally, IPSP should be compatible with\n         formal methods, such as implementing
    security policies with\n         provable properties.\n"

    - "3.1.  General Requirements\n   An IPSP solution MUST include:\n      -  A policy
      model with well-defined semantics that captures the\n         relationship between
      IPsec SAs and higher-level security\n         policies,\n      -  A gateway
      discovery mechanism that allows hosts to discover\n         where to direct
      IPsec traffic intended for a specific endpoint,\n      -  A well-specified language
      for describing host policies,\n      -  A means for distributing responsibility
      for different aspects\n         of policy to different entities,\n      -  A
      mechanism for discovering the policy of a host,\n      -  A mechanism for resolving
      the specific IPsec parameters to be\n         used between two hosts governed
      by different policies (and for\n         determining whether any such parameters
      exist); and,\n      -  A well-specified mechanism for checking for compliance
      with a\n         host's policy when SAs are created.\n   The mechanisms used
      in IPSP must not require any protocol\n   modifications in any of the IPsec
      standards (ESP [RFC-2406], AH,\n   [RFC-2402], IKE [RFC-2409]).  The mechanisms
      must be independent of\n   the SA-negotiation protocol, but may assume certain
      functionality\n   from such a protocol (this is to ensure that future SA-negotiation\n
      \  protocols are not incompatible with IPSP).\n"

        gateways exist between\n   the initiator and the intended communication peer.
        \ The actual\n   mechanism employed may be used to piggy-back information
        necessary by\n   other components of the IPSP architecture (e.g., policy discovery,
        as\n   is done in [SPP]).  The discovery mechanism may have to be invoked
        at\n   any time, independently of existing security associations or other\n

      - "3.2.3.  Policy Specification Language\n   In order to allow for policy discovery,
        compliance checking, and\n   resolution across a range of hosts, a common
        language is necessary in\n   which to express the policies of hosts that need
        to communicate with\n   one another.  Statements in this language are the
        output of policy\n   discovery, and provide the input to the policy resolution
        and\n   compliance checking systems.  Note that a host's or network's\n   security
        policy may be expressed in a vendor-specific way, but would\n   be translated
        to the common language when it is to be managed by the\n   IPSP services.\n"

        all or part of a host's\n   policy to be managed remotely, possibly by more
        than one entity.\n   This is a basic requirement for large-scale networks

        essential information\n   that two IPsec endpoints can use to determine what
        kinds of SAs are\n   possible between one another.  This is especially important
        for hosts\n   that are not controlled by the same entity, and that might not\n
        \  initially share any common information about one another.  Note that\n
        \  a host need not reveal its entire security policy, only enough\n   information
        to support the SA resolution system for hosts that might\n   want to communicate
        with it.\n"

        about each other's policies, it\n   must be possible (and computationally
        feasible) to find an acceptable\n   set of SA parameters that meets both host's
        requirements and will\n   lead to the successful creation of a new SA.\n"

        resolution scheme, it must\n   be checked for compliance with the local security
        policy of each\n   host.  The security and soundness of the SAs created by
        IPSP-managed\n   communication should depend only on the correctness of the
        compliance\n   checking stage.  In particular, even if the SA resolution scheme\n
        \  (which is likely to be computationally and conceptually complex)\n   produces
        an incorrect result, it should still not be possible to\n   violate the specified
