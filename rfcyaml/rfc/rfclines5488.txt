Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB), the Network Mobility (NEMO) support MIB, for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, the NEMO MIB will be used to monitor and control a Mobile IPv6 node with NEMO functionality.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The Mobile IPv6 Protocol and NEMO Entities
[RFC3775] specifies a protocol that allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.
Basic Support Protocol [RFC3963] is an extension to the Mobile IPv6 protocol that facilitates the movement of an entire network.
The goals of Network Mobility support and related terminology are discussed in [RFC4886] and [RFC4885], respectively.
Typically, mobile routers implement NEMO functionality for achieving network mobility.
However, a mobile router may also function as a mobile node.
In the context of this document, an entity that implements the NEMO protocol is a NEMO entity.
This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used to monitor and control NEMO entities.
Relationship to Other MIB Modules
This document focuses on the management of a NEMO entity.
It is assumed that implementations will support the ifTable from the IF MIB
The MOBILEIPV6 MIB [RFC4295] defines the managed objects for a mobile node.
Implementations supporting both the mobile node and NEMO functionality SHOULD implement the managed objects defined for the NEMO entities and mobile nodes from both the MOBILEIPV6 MIB and NEMO MIB.
The NEMO MIB uses the textual conventions defined in the INET ADDRESS MIB [RFC4001].
The terminology used in this document is consistent with the definitions used in the Mobile IPv6 protocol specification [RFC3775] and the NEMO Basic Support specification [RFC3963].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 2.4.
The NEMO MIB comprises the following groups of definitions:
nemoCore: a generic group containing objects that are common to all NEMO entities.
nemoHa: this group models the home agent service.
It is composed of objects specific to the services and associated advertisement parameters offered by the home agent on each of its links.
It also contains objects pertaining to the maintenance of the home agent list on each of the links on which the service is offered.
this group models the mobile router service.
It is composed of objects specific to the Dynamic Home Agent discovery function and related parameters.
It also contains objects that record the movement of the mobile router.
nemoNotifications: defines the set of notifications that will be used to asynchronously monitor the NEMO entities.
The tables contained in the above groups are as follows:
nemoBindingCacheTable: models the Binding Cache on the home agent and correspondent node.
It contains details of the Binding Update requests that have been received and accepted.
nemoMrEgressIfTable: contains information on the configured egress interfaces.
nemoMrBLTable: models the Binding Update List on the mobile router.
It contains information about the registration requests sent by the mobile router and the corresponding results.
: contains registration statistics for all mobile routers registered with the home agent.
nemoHaMobileNetworkPrefixTable: contains the list of the mobile network prefixes that are maintained by the home agent.

10 March 2009 DESCRIPTION "Initial version, published as RFC 5488."
The value of the status field in the Binding Acknowledgment message when the Binding Update was rejected for NEMO specific reasons. "
"This object indicates the NEMO functions that are supported by this managed entity.
Multiple NEMO functions may be supported by a single entity. "
"This object indicates whether the NEMO function is enabled for the managed entity.
If it is enabled, the agent discovery and registration functions will be operational.
Changing the status from enabled(1) to disabled(2) will terminate the agent discovery and registration functions.
On the other hand, changing the status from disabled(2) to enabled(1) will start the agent discovery and registration functions.
The value of this object MUST remain unchanged across reboots of the managed entity. "
"The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this NEMO entity's counters, viz., counters with OID prefix 'nemoMrConf', 'nemoMrRegnCounters', 'nemoMrGlobalStats', or 'nemoHaGlobalStats', suffered a discontinuity.
If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object will have a zero value. "
"This table corresponds to the Binding Update List (BL) that includes NEMO related information and that is maintained by the mobile router.
The table holds a row for every binding that the mobile router has established or is trying to establish.
Entries from the table are deleted as the lifetime of the binding expires. "
An entry pertaining to NEMO related information contained in a Binding Update sent by a NEMO enabled mobile router to its home agent. "
explicitMode(2): the mobile router included one or more Mobile Network Prefix Options in the Binding Update. "
false(2): the mobile router did not send the Binding Update with Mobile Router Flag set.
This implies that the mobile router is acting as a mobile node. "
"The prefix length of the mobile router's home network.
"The prefix length of the care of address of the mobile router.
"The interface index of the currently active egress interface. "
"The interface index of the tunnel established between the mobile router and the home agent for NEMO traffic. "
"The total number of mobility messages, i.e., IPv6 datagrams with Mobility Header, sent by the mobile node.
This will include Binding Updates sent by a mobile router with the Mobile Router Flag set.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of nemoCounterDiscontinuityTime. "
"The total number of mobility messages, i.e., IPv6 datagrams with Mobility Header, received by the mobile node.

Sections 4.2, 6.1 RFC 3963:
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
"This object indicates the mode in which the mobile network prefixes will be registered with the home agent.
implicitMode(1): the Mobile Network Prefix Option will not be included in the Binding Update by the mobile router.
explicitMode(2): the mobile router will include one or more Mobile Network Prefix Options in the Binding Update.
The value of this object MUST remain unchanged across reboots of the managed entity. "
SEQUENCE OF NemoHaMobileNetworkPrefixEntry MAX ACCESS
"This table contains the mobile network prefixes that the home agent maintains for the mobile router.
The mobile network prefixes in this table are registered by Binding Updates or are manually pre configured. "
An entry for a mobile network prefix.
The instances of the columnar objects in this entry pertain to an interface for a particular value of mip6BindingHomeAddressType, mip6BindingHomeAddress, and nemoHaMobileNetworkPrefixSeqNo.
The nemoHaMobileNetworkPrefixSeqNo object is used to distinguish between multiple instances of the mobile network prefix in the same Binding Update for the same set of mip6BindingHomeAddressType and mip6BindingHomeAddress.
There is no upper bound on the maximum number of mobile network prefixes in a Binding Update but, for practical purposes, the upper bound of the value nemoHaMobileNetworkPrefixSeqNo is set to 1024.
Implementers need to be aware that if the total number of octets in mip6BindingHomeAddress exceeds 112, then OIDs of column instances in this row will have more than 128 sub identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
INTEGER } nemoHaMobileNetworkPrefixSeqNo OBJECT TYPE

IANA Considerations IANA has assigned a base arc in the mib 2 (Standards Track) OID tree for the 'nemoMIB' (184).
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: nemoStatus:
The value of this object is used to enable or disable the NEMO functionality on a NEMO entity.
Access to this MO may be abused to disrupt the communication that depends on NEMO.
: The value of this object is used to control the mode in which mobile network prefixes will be registered with the home agent.
Access to this object may be abused to disrupt the setting up of mobile network prefixes.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
nemoHaMobileNetworkPrefixLength: The above address related objects may be considered to be particularly sensitive and/or private.
The mobile network  prefix related objects reveal the configuration of the mobile router and, as such, may be considered to be sensitive.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
