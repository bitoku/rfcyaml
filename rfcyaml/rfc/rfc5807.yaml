    \  Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) and an\n   enforcement
    point, for bootstrapping lower-layer ciphering.  The\n   master key is derived
    from the Master Session Key of the Extensible\n   Authentication Protocol as a
    result of successful PANA\n   authentication.  The master key guarantees cryptographic
    independence\n   among enforcement points bootstrapped from PANA authentication

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access
    (PANA)\n   [RFC5191] is designed to facilitate network access authentication and\n
    \  authorization of clients in access networks.  It carries Extensible\n   Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] between a PANA Client (PaC)\n   and a PANA Authentication
    Agent (PAA) where the PAA functions as an\n   authentication gateway to the Authentication
    Server (AS).  The PANA\n   framework [RFC5193] defines an another entity referred
    to as an\n   Enforcement Point (EP), which resides in the access network and\n
    \  allows access (data traffic) of authorized PaCs while preventing\n   access
    of others depending on the PANA authentication and\n   authorization result (Figure
    1).  The EP and PAA may be implemented\n   on the same device or separate devices.\n

    1: PANA Functional Model\n   The EP uses non-cryptographic or cryptographic filters
    to selectively\n   allow and discard data packets.  These filters may be applied
    at the\n   link-layer or the IP-layer [PANA-IPSEC].  When cryptographic access\n
    \  control is used, a secure association protocol [RFC3748] needs to run\n   between
    the PaC and EP.  After completion of the secure association\n   protocol, link-
    or network-layer per-packet security (for example,\n   IPsec ESP) is enabled for
    integrity protection, data origin\n   authentication, replay protection, and optionally
    confidentiality\n   protection.\n   This document defines the PaC-EP Master Key
    (PEMK) that is used by a\n   secure association protocol as the pre-shared secret
    between the PaC\n   and EP to enable cryptographic filters in the access network.
    \ The\n   PEMK is defined to guarantee cryptographic independence among EPs\n
    \  bootstrapped from PANA authentication across different address\n   families.
    \ This document also describes a guideline for distributing\n   PEMKs from the
    PAA to EP.\n   This document does not specify a mechanism for a PaC to know whether\n
    \  the lower layer requires a secure association protocol or the pre-\n   shared
    secret for the secure association protocol needs to be\n   bootstrapped from PANA
    authentication.  Such a mechanism may be\n   defined by each lower-layer protocol.\n"

    title: 1.1.  Specification of Requirements
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This document reuses the following terms defined in [RFC5191]:
    PaC\n   (PANA Client), PAA (PANA Authentication Agent), EP (Enforcement\n   Point),
    MSK (Master Session Key), PANA Session, and Session\n   Identifier.\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  PaC-EP Master Key\n   A PEMK (PaC-EP Master Key) is derived from an available
    MSK.  The\n   PEMK is 64 octets in length and is calculated as follows:\n   PEMK
    = prf+(MSK, \"IETF PEMK\" | SID | KID | EPID)\n          where | denotes concatenation.\n
    \  o  The prf+ function is defined in IKEv2 [RFC4306].  The pseudo-\n      random
    function used for the prf+ function is specified in the\n      PRF-Algorithm AVP
    carried in a PANA-Auth-Request message with 'S'\n      (Start) bit set.\n   o
    \ \"IETF PEMK\" is the ASCII code representation of the non-NULL\n      terminated
    string (excluding the double quotes around it).\n   o  SID is a four-octet Session
    Identifier [RFC5191].\n   o  KID is the content of the Key-ID AVP [RFC5191] associated
    with the\n      MSK.\n   o  EPID is the identifier of the EP.  The first two octets
    represents\n      the AddressType, which contains an Address Family defined in\n
    \     [IANAADFAM].  The remaining octets encode the address value.  The\n      length
    of the address value is determined by the AddressType.  The\n      AddressType
    is used to discriminate the content and format of the\n      remaining octets
    for the address value.  The use of the\n      combination of address family and
    address value guarantees the\n      cryptographic independence of PEMKs among
    multiple EPs that are\n      bootstrapped from PANA authentication across multiple
    address\n      families.  How a PaC discovers an EPID is out of the scope of this\n
    \     document.\n"

    - "3.1.  Key Name of PEMK\n   The key name of the PEMK is defined as follows.\n
      \  PEMKname = SHA1(EPID | SID | KID), where SHA1 denotes the SHA-1\n   algorithm
      specified in [SHS].  Inclusion of the EPID, SID, and KID\n   provides uniqueness
      of PEMK names among multiple PaC-EP pairs under a\n   given PAA.\n"

      to the lifetime of\n   the MSK from which it is derived.  At the end of the
      lifetime, the\n   PEMK and its associated states MUST be deleted.\n"

    as\n   key lifetime, key scope, key context, and key name are described in\n   Section
    3.\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Channel Binding\n   Since the device identifier of the EP is involved
      in the key\n   derivation function, Channel Binding on a PEMK is made between
      the\n   PaC and PAA at the time when the PEMK is generated.  If a malicious\n
      \  EP advertises a different device identifier than that registered with\n   the
      PAA, the malicious attempt will not succeed since the secure\n   association
      protocol will fail due to the difference in the PEMK\n   values calculated by
      the PaC and the EP.\n"

    - "4.2.  Guideline for Distributing PEMK from PAA to EP\n   When an EP is implemented
      on the same device as the PAA, no protocol\n   needs to be used for distributing
      a PEMK from the PAA to the EP.\n   In the case where the EP is implemented on
      a separate device from the\n   PAA, a protocol is needed to distribute a PEMK
      from the PAA to the\n   EP.  Such a key distribution protocol may depend on
      the architecture\n   and deployment using PANA.  A key distribution protocol
      for a PEMK\n   MUST ensure that the PEMK is encrypted as well as integrity and\n
      \  replay protected, with a security association between the PAA and EP,\n   where
      the security association MUST be cryptographically bound to the\n   identities
      of the PAA and EP known to the PaC.\n"
