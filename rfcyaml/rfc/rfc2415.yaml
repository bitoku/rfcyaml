  - "Abstract\n   An increase in the permissible initial window size of a TCP\n  \
    \ connection, from one segment to three or four segments, has been\n   under discussion\
    \ in the tcp-impl working group. This document covers\n   some simulation studies\
    \ of the effects of increasing the initial\n   window size of TCP. Both long-lived\
    \ TCP connections (file transfers)\n   and short-lived web-browsing style connections\
    \ were modeled. The\n   simulations were performed using the publicly available\
    \ ns-2\n   simulator and our custom models and files are also available.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   We present results from a set of simulations with increased\
    \ TCP\n   initial window (IW). The main objectives were to explore the\n   conditions\
    \ under which the larger IW was a \"win\" and to determine the\n   effects, if\
    \ any, the larger IW might have on other traffic flows\n   using an IW of one\
    \ segment.\n   This study was inspired by discussions at the Munich IETF tcp-impl\n\
    \   and tcp-sat meetings. A proposal to increase the IW size to about 4K\n   bytes\
    \ (4380 bytes in the case of 1460 byte segments) was discussed.\n   Concerns about\
    \ both the utility of the increase and its effect on\n   other traffic were raised.\
    \ Some studies were presented showing the\n   positive effects of increased IW\
    \ on individual connections, but no\n   studies were shown with a wide variety\
    \ of simultaneous traffic flows.\n   It appeared that some of the questions being\
    \ raised could be\n   addressed in an ns-2 simulation. Early results from our\
    \ simulations\n   were previously posted to the tcp-impl mailing list and presented\
    \ at\n   the tcp-impl WG meeting at the December 1997 IETF.\n"

    \                  URLs -->          <--- FTP & Web data\n   File downloading\
    \ and web-browsing clients are attached to the nodes\n   (n2-n5) on the left-hand\
    \ side. These clients are served by the FTP\n   and Web servers attached to the\
    \ nodes (n6-n9) on the right-hand side.\n   The links to and from those nodes\
    \ are at 10 Mbps. The bottleneck link\n   is between n1 and n0. All links are\
    \ bi-directional, but only ACKs,\n   SYNs, FINs, and URLs are flowing from left\
    \ to right. Some simulations\n   were also performed with data traffic flowing\
    \ from right to left\n   simultaneously, but it had no effect on the results.\n\
    \   In the simulations we assumed that all ftps transferred 1-MB files\n   and\
    \ that all web pages had exactly three embedded URLs. The web\n   clients are\
    \ browsing quite aggressively, requesting a new page after\n   a random delay\
    \ uniformly distributed between 1 and 5 seconds. This is\n   not meant to realistically\
    \ model a single user's web-browsing\n   pattern, but to create a reasonably heavy\
    \ traffic load whose\n   individual tcp connections accurately reflect real web\
    \ traffic. Some\n   discussion of these models as used in earlier studies is available\
    \ in\n   references [3] and [4].\n   The maximum tcp window was set to 11 packets,\
    \ maximum packet (or\n   segment) size to 1460 bytes, and buffer sizes were set\
    \ at 25 packets.\n   (The ns-2 TCPs require setting window sizes and buffer sizes\
    \ in\n   number of packets. In our tcp-full code some of the internal\n   parameters\
    \ have been set to be byte-oriented, but external values\n   must still be set\
    \ in number of packets.)  In our simulations, we\n   varied the number of data\
    \ segments sent into a new TCP connection (or\n   initial window) from one to\
    \ four, keeping all segments at 1460 bytes.\n   A dropped packet causes a restart\
    \ window of one segment to be used,\n   just as in current practice.\n   For ns-2\
    \ users: The tcp-full code was modified to use an\n   \"application\" class and\
    \ three application client-server pairs were\n   written: a simple file transfer\
    \ (ftp), a model of http1.0 style web\n   connection and a very rough model of\
    \ http1.1 style web connection.\n   The required files and scripts for these simulations\
    \ are available\n   under the contributed code section on the ns-simulator web\
    \ page at\n   the sites ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/IW.{tar, tar.Z} or http://www-\n\
    \   nrg.ee.lbl.gov/floyd/tcp_init_win.html.\n   Simulations were run with 8, 16,\
    \ 32 web clients and a number of ftp\n   clients ranging from 0 to 3. The IW was\
    \ varied from 1 to 4, though\n   the 4-packet case lies beyond what is currently\
    \ recommended. The\n   figures of merit used were goodput, the median page delay\
    \ seen by the\n   web clients and the median file transfer delay seen by the ftp\n\
    \   clients. The simulated run time was rather large, 360 seconds, to\n   ensure\
    \ an adequate sample. (Median values remained the same for\n   simulations with\
    \ larger run times and can be considered stable)\n"

  - "3. Results\n   In our simulations, we varied the number of file transfer clients\
    \ in\n   order to change the congestion of the link. Recall that our ftp\n   clients\
    \ continuously request 1 Mbyte transfers, so the link\n   utilization is over\
    \ 90% when even a single ftp client is present.\n   When three file transfer clients\
    \ are running simultaneously, the\n   resultant congestion is somewhat pathological,\
    \ making the values\n   recorded stable. Though all connections use the same initial\
    \ window,\n   the effect of increasing the IW on a 1 Mbyte file transfer is not\n\
    \   detectable, thus we focus on the web browsing connections.  (In the\n   tables,\
    \ we use \"webs\" to indicate number of web clients and \"ftps\" to\n   indicate\
    \ the number of file transfer clients attached.) Table 1 shows\n   the median\
    \ delays experienced by the web transfers with an increase\n   in the TCP IW.\
    \  There is clearly an improvement in transfer delays\n   for the web connections\
    \ with increase in the IW, in many cases on the\n   order of 30%.  The steepness\
    \ of the performance improvement going\n   from an IW of 1 to an IW of 2 is mainly\
    \ due to the distribution of\n   files fetched by each URL (see references [1]\
    \ and [2]); the median\n   size of both primary and in-line URLs fits completely\
    \ into two\n   packets. If file distributions change, the shape of this curve\
    \ may\n   also change.\n   Table 1. Median web page delay\n   #Webs   #FTPs  \

    \ Packet drop rates did increase\n   with IW, but in all cases except that of\
    \ the single most pathological\n   overload, the increase in drop percentage was\
    \ less than 1%. A\n   decrease in packet drop percentage is observed in some overloaded\n\
    \   situations, specifically when ftp transfers consumed most of the link\n  \
    \ bandwidth and a large number of web transfers shared the remaining\n   bandwidth\
    \ of the link. In this case, the web transfers experience\n   severe packet loss\
    \ and some of the IW=4 web clients suffer multiple\n   packet losses from the\
    \ same window, resulting in longer recovery\n   times than when there is a single\
    \ packet loss in a window. During the\n   recovery time, the connections are inactive\
    \ which alleviates\n   congestion and thus results in a decrease in the packet\
    \ drop\n   percentage. It should be noted that such observations were made only\n\
    \   in extremely overloaded scenarios.\n"

    \ picture of performance, we computed the\n   network power, goodput divided by\
    \ median delay (in Mbytes/ms), and\n   plotted it against IW for all scenarios.\
    \ (Each scenario is uniquely\n   identified by its number of webs and number of\
    \ file transfers.) We\n   plot these values in Figure 1 (in the pdf version),\
    \ illustrating a\n   general advantage to increasing IW. When a large number of\
    \ web\n   clients is combined with ftps, particularly multiple ftps,\n   pathological\
    \ cases result from the extreme congestion. In these\n   cases, there appears\
    \ to be no particular trend to the results of\n   increasing the IW, in fact simulation\
    \ results are not particularly\n   stable.\n   To get a clearer picture of what\
    \ is happening across all the tested\n   scenarios, we normalized the network\
    \ power values for the non-\n   pathological scenario by the network power for\
    \ that scenario at IW of\n   one. These results are plotted in Figure 2. As IW\
    \ is increased from\n   one to four, network power increased by at least 15%,\
    \ even in a\n   congested scenario dominated by bulk transfer traffic. In simulations\n\
    \   where web traffic has a dominant share of the available bandwidth,\n   the\
    \ increase in network power was up to 60%.\n   The increase in network power at\
    \ higher initial window sizes is due\n   to an increase in throughput and a decrease\
    \ in the delay. Since the\n   (slightly) increased drop rates were accompanied\
    \ by better\n   performance, drop rate is clearly not an indicator of user level\n\
    \   performance.\n   The gains in performance seen by the web clients need to\
    \ be balanced\n   against the performance the file transfers are seeing. We computed\n\
    \   ftp network power and show this in Table 3.  It appears that the\n   improvement\
    \ in network power seen by the web connections has\n   negligible effect on the\
    \ concurrent file transfers. It can be\n   observed from the table that there\
    \ is a small variation in the\n   network power of file transfers with an increase\
    \ in the size of IW\n   but no particular trend can be seen. It can be concluded\
    \ that the\n   network power of file transfers essentially remained the same.\n\
    \   However, it should be noted that a larger IW does allow web transfers\n  \
    \ to gain slightly more bandwidth than with a smaller IW. This could\n   mean\
    \ fewer bytes transferred for FTP applications or a slight\n   decrease in network\
    \ power as computed by us.\n   Table 3. Network power of file transfers with an\

    \ style web connections, thus, a\n   natural question is to ask how results are\
    \ affected by migration to\n   http1.1. A rough model of this behavior was simulated\
    \ by using one\n   connection to send all of the information from both the primary\
    \ URL\n   and the three embedded, or in-line, URLs. Since the transfer size is\n\
    \   now made up of four web files, the steep improvement in performance\n   between\
    \ an IW of 1 and an IW of two, noted in the previous results,\n   has been smoothed.\
    \ Results are shown in Tables 4 & 5 and Figs. 3 & 4.\n   Occasionally an increase\
    \ in IW from 3 to 4 decreases the network\n   power owing to a non-increase or\
    \ a slight decrease in the throughput.\n   TCP connections opening up with a higher\
    \ window size into a very\n   congested network might experience some packet drops\
    \ and consequently\n   a slight decrease in the throughput. This indicates that\
    \ increase of\n   the initial window sizes to further higher values (>4) may not\
    \ always\n   result in a favorable network performance. This can be seen clearly\n\
    \   in Figure 4 where the network power shows a decrease for the two\n   highly\
    \ congested cases.\n   Table 4. Median web page delay for http1.1\n   #Webs  \

    \ a total of 16 web-\n   browsing connections, all using IW of one. Then the clients\

    \   used IW=3.\n   We repeated the simulations for a total of 32 and 64 web-browsing\n\
    \   clients, splitting those into groups of 16 and 32 respectively. Table\n  \
    \ 6 shows these results.  We report the goodput (in Mbytes), the web\n   page\
    \ delays (in milli seconds), the percent utilization of the link\n   and the percent\
    \ of packets dropped.\n"

    \ non-split experiments are consistent with our\n   earlier results, clients with\
    \ IW=3 outperform clients with IW=1. The\n   results of running the 8/8 and 16/16\
    \ splits show that running a\n   mixture of IW=3 and IW=1 has no negative effect\
    \ on the IW=1\n   conversations, while IW=3 conversations maintain their performance.\n\
    \   However, the 32/32 split shows that web-browsing connections with\n   IW=3\
    \ are adversely affected. We believe this is due to the\n   pathological dynamics\
    \ of this extremely congested scenario. Since\n   embedded URLs open their connections\
    \ simultaneously, very large\n   number of TCP connections are arriving at the\
    \ bottleneck link\n   resulting in multiple packet losses for the IW=3 conversations.\
    \ The\n   myriad problems of this simultaneous opening strategy is, of course,\n\
    \   part of the motivation for the development of http1.1.\n"

  - "4. Discussion\n   The indications from these results are that increasing the\
    \ initial\n   window size to 3 packets (or 4380 bytes) helps to improve perceived\n\
    \   performance. Many further variations on these simulation scenarios\n   are\
    \ possible and we've made our simulation models and scripts\n   available in order\
    \ to facilitate others' experiments.\n   We also used the RED queue management\
    \ included with ns-2 to perform\n   some other simulation studies. We have not\
    \ reported on those results\n   here since we don't consider the studies complete.\
    \ We found that by\n   adding RED to the bottleneck link, we achieved similar\
    \ performance\n   gains (with an IW of 1) to those we found with increased IWs\
    \ without\n   RED. Others may wish to investigate this further.\n   Although the\
    \ simulation sets were run for a T1 link, several\n   scenarios with varying levels\
    \ of congestion and varying number of web\n   and ftp clients were analyzed. It\
    \ is reasonable to expect that the\n   results would scale for links with higher\
    \ bandwidth. However,\n   interested readers could investigate this aspect further.\n\
    \   We also used the RED queue management included with ns-2 to perform\n   some\
