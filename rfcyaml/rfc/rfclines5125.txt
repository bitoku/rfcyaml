Abstract This document reclassifies RFC 3525, Gateway Control Protocol Version 1, to Historic Status.
This memo also obsoletes RFC 3525.
The purpose of this document is to reclassify RFC 3525, Gateway Control Protocol Version 1, to Historic Status.
Reclassification of RFC 3525 to Historic
The protocol defined by RFC 3525
[RFC3525] was developed jointly by the IETF Megaco Working Group and ITU T Study Group 16.
The ITU T published ITU T Recommendation H.248.1 (originally H.248) with the same contents as RFC 3525.
Since that initial development, the ITU T has taken ownership of the protocol and has continued to work on it.
The protocol as originally defined in RFC 3525 underwent a series of corrections and clarifications.
[h248v1] was republished in March, 2002, incorporating all changes agreed upon up to that date.
Since then, further corrections have been agreed upon.
The accumulated set of corrections to H.248.1 (03/2002) is available in the Implementors' Guide for Recommendation H.248.1 Version 1 (03/ 2002) ("Media Gateway Control Protocol")
[impgdv1], which is available at no charge on the ITU T web site.
RFC 3525 has been rendered even more obsolete as a specification of the Megaco/H.248 protocol by the publication of further versions of ITU T Recommendation H.248.1.
[h248v2] was published in May, 2002, and is the version most widely deployed at present.
It is also the version that other standards bodies such as 3GPP are currently using as the basis for their own profile specifications.
Version 3 [h248v3] was published more recently, in September, 2005.
In short, RFC 3525 may serve as an introduction to the Megaco/H.248 protocol, but it is misleading as a description of the protocol as currently standardized or deployed.
It is appropriate to reclassify RFC 3525 to Historic status, as described in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].
Security Considerations Reclassifying RFC 3525 has no security implications.
This document does not require any new actions by the IANA.
The IANA registries established by RFC 3525 and extended by successive versions of ITU T H.248.1 remain in force, along with the requirement for expert review by an IESG designated expert.
