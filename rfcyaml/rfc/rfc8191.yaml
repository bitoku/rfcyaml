  - "Abstract\n   In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification, a Mobile
    Node\n   (MN) is assigned with a Home Network Prefix (HNP) during its initial\n
    \  attachment, and the MN configures its Home Address (HoA) with the\n   HNP.
    \ During the movement of the MN, the HNP remains unchanged to\n   keep ongoing
    communications associated with the HoA.  However, the\n   current PMIPv6 specification
    does not specify related operations when\n   HNP renumbering has occurred (e.g.,
    due to change of service provider\n   or site topology, etc.).  In this document,
    a solution to support HNP\n   renumbering is proposed, as an optional extension
    of the PMIPv6\n   specification.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   At the time of writing, network managers prefer Provider-Independent\n
    \  (PI) addressing for IPv6 to attempt to minimize the need for future\n   possible
    renumbering.  However, a widespread use of PI addresses will\n   cause Border
    Gateway Protocol (BGP) scaling problems [RFC7010].  It\n   is thus desirable to
    develop tools and practices that make IPv6\n   renumbering a simpler process to
    reduce demand for IPv6 PI space\n   [RFC6879].  In this document, we aim to support
    HNP renumbering when\n   the HNP in PMIPv6 [RFC5213] is not a PI prefix.\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction

  - "2.  Usage Scenarios\n   There are a number of reasons why HNP renumbering support
    in PMIPv6\n   is useful, and some scenarios are identified below:\n   Scenario
    1:  the HNP set used by a PMIPv6 service provider is\n                assigned
    by a different Internet Service Provider (ISP),\n                and then HNP
    renumbering MAY occur if the PMIPv6 service\n                provider switches
    to a different ISP.\n   Scenario 2:  multiple Local Mobility Anchors (LMAs) MAY
    be deployed\n                by the same PMIPv6 service provider, and then each
    LMA\n                MAY serve for a specific HNP set.  In this case, the HNP\n
    \               of an MN MAY change if the serving LMA is changed to\n                another
    LMA that does not inherit the assigned HNP set\n                [RFC6463].\n   Scenario
    3:  PMIPv6 HNP renumbering MAY be caused by the rebuilding\n                of
    the network architecture as the companies split,\n                merge, grow,
    relocate, or reorganize.  For example, the\n                PMIPv6 service provider
    MAY reorganize its network\n                topology.\n   In Scenario 1, we assume
    that only the HNP is renumbered, while the\n   serving LMA remains unchanged;
    this is the basic scenario considered\n   in this document.  In Scenarios 2 and
    3, more complex situations MAY\n   result; for example, HNP renumbering MAY occur
    due to the switchover\n   of a serving LMA.\n   In the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol,
    when an HNP changes, the Home\n   Agent (HA) will actively notify its MN about
    the new prefix, and then\n   the renumbering of the Home Network Address (HoA)
    can be well\n   supported [RFC6275].  In basic PMIPv6, the PMIPv6 binding is\n
    \  triggered by a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG), which detects the\n   attachment
    of the MN.  A scheme is also needed for the LMA to\n   immediately initiate the
    PMIPv6 binding state refreshment during the\n   HNP renumbering process.  Although
    this issue is also mentioned in\n   Section 6.12 of [RFC5213], the related solution
    has not been\n   specified.\n"

  - "3.  HNP Renumbering Procedure\n   When HNP renumbering happens in PMIPv6, the
    LMA MUST notify the MAG\n   about the new HNP, and then the MAG MUST announce
    the new HNP to the\n   attached MN accordingly.  Also, the LMA and the MAG MUST
    update the\n   routing states for the HNP and the related addresses.  To support\n
    \  this procedure, [RFC7077] can be adopted; it specifies an\n   asynchronous
    update from the LMA to the MAG about specific session\n   parameters.  This document
    considers the following two cases:\n   (1) HNP is renumbered under the same LMA\n
    \      In this case, the LMA remains unchanged as in Scenarios 1 and 3.\n       The
    steps are shown in Figure 1.\n       +-----+                +-----+                +-----+\n

    1: Signaling Call Flow for HNP Renumbering\n       o  When a PMIPv6 service provider
    renumbers the HNP set under the\n          same LMA, the serving LMA SHOULD initiate
    the HNP renumbering\n          operation.  The LMA allocates a new HNP for the
    related MN.\n       o  The LMA sends the Update Notification (UPN) message to
    the MAG\n          to update the HNP information.  If the Dynamic Host\n          Configuration
    Protocol (DHCP) is used to allocate the address,\n          the DHCP infrastructure
    MUST also be notified about the new\n          HNP.\n       o  Once the MAG receives
    this UPN message, it recognizes that the\n          related MN has the new HNP.
    \ Then, the MAG MUST notify the MN\n          about the new HNP with a Router
    Advertisement (RA) message or\n          allocate a new address within the new
    HNP through a DHCP\n          procedure.\n       o  After the MN obtains the HNP
    information through the RA\n          message, it deletes the old HoA and configures
    a new HoA with\n          the newly allocated HNP.\n       o  When the new HNP
    is announced or the new address is configured\n          to the MN successfully,
    the MAG MUST update the related\n          binding and routing states.  Then,
    the MAG sends back the\n          Update Notification Acknowledgement (UPA) message
    to the LMA\n          for the notification of successful update of the HNP, related\n
    \         binding state, and routing state.  Then, the LMA updates the\n          routing
    and binding information corresponding to the MN in\n          order to replace
    the old HNP with the new one.\n   (2) HNP renumbering is caused by the LMA switchover\n
    \      Since the HNP is assigned by the LMA, HNP renumbering MAY be\n       caused
    by the LMA switchover, as in Scenarios 2 and 3.\n       The LMA information is
    the basic configuration information of the\n       MAG.  When the LMA changes,
    the related profile SHOULD be updated\n       by the service provider.  In this
    way, the MAG initiates the\n       binding registration to the MN's new LMA as
    specified in\n       [RFC5213].  When HNP renumbering is caused in this case,
    the new\n       HNP information is sent by the LMA during the new binding\n       procedure.
    \ Accordingly, the MAG withdraws the old HNP of the MN\n       and announces the
    new HNP to the MN, similar to the case when the\n       HNP is renumbered under
    the same LMA.\n"
  title: 3.  HNP Renumbering Procedure
- contents:
  - "4.  Session Connectivity\n   HNP renumbering MAY cause the disconnection of the
    ongoing\n   communications of the MN.  Basically, there are two modes to manage\n
    \  the session connectivity during HNP renumbering.\n   (1)  Soft mode\n        The
    LMA will temporarily maintain the state of the old HNP\n        during the HNP
    renumbering (after the UPA reception) in order to\n        redirect the packets
    to the MN before the MN reconnects the\n        ongoing session and notifies the
    Correspondent Node (CN) about\n        its new HoA.  This mode is aiming to reduce
    packet loss during\n        HNP renumbering, but the binding state corresponding
    to the old\n        HNP SHOULD be marked, for example, as transient binding\n
    \       [RFC6058].  Also, the LMA MUST stop broadcasting the routing\n        information
    about the old HNP if the old HNP is no longer\n        anchored at this LMA.\n
    \  (2)  Hard mode\n        If HNP renumbering happens with the switchover of the
    LMA, hard\n        mode is RECOMMENDED to keep the protocol simple.  In this mode,\n
    \       the LMA deletes the binding state of the old HNP after it\n        receives
    the UPA message from the MAG, and the LMA silently\n        discards the packets
    destined to the old HNP.\n"
  title: 4.  Session Connectivity
- contents:
  - "5.  Message Format\n   (1)  UPN message\n        In the UPN message sent from
    the LMA to the MAG, the\n        notification reason is set to 2 (UPDATE-SESSION-PARAMETERS).\n
    \       Besides, the HNP Option [RFC5213] containing the new HNP and the\n        Mobile
    Node Identifier Option [RFC4283] (which identifies the\n        MN) are contained
    as Mobility Options of UPN.  The order of the\n        HNP Option and Mobile Node
    Identifier Option in the UPN message\n        is not mandated here.\n   (2)  UPA
    message\n        The MAG sends this message in order to acknowledge that it has\n
    \       received an UPN message with the (A) flag set and to indicate\n        the
    status after processing the message.  If the MAG did not\n        successfully
    renumber the HNP, which is required in the UPN\n        message, the UPA message
    has the Status Code set to 128 (FAILED-\n        TO-UPDATE-SESSION-PARAMETERS),
    and the subsequent operation of\n        the LMA is PMIPv6 service provider specific.\n
    \  (3)  RA message\n        When the RA message is used by the MAG to advise the
    new HNP, it\n        contains two Prefix Information Options [RFC4861] [RFC4862].
    \ In\n        the first Prefix Information Option, the old HNP is carried, and\n
    \       the related Preferred Lifetime is set to 0.  In the second\n        Prefix
    Information Option, the new HNP is carried with the Valid\n        Lifetime, and
    Preferred Lifetime set to larger than 0.\n   (4)  DHCP message\n        When the
    DHCP is used in PMIPv6 to configure the addresses for\n        the MN, new IPv6
    address or addresses (e.g., the HoA) will be\n        generated based on the new
    HNP, and the related DHCP procedure\n        is also triggered by the reception
    of the UPN message [RFC3315].\n"
  title: 5.  Message Format
- contents:
  - "6.  Other Issues\n   In order to maintain the reachability of the MN, the Domain
    Name\n   System (DNS) resource record corresponding to this MN MAY need to be\n
    \  updated when the HNP of the MN changes [RFC3007].  However, this is\n   beyond
    the scope of this document.\n"
  title: 6.  Other Issues
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The UPN and UPA messages in this document MUST
    be protected using\n   end-to-end security association(s) offering integrity and
    data origin\n   authentication as specified in [RFC5213] and [RFC7077].\n   When
    HNP renumbering is triggered, a new HNP SHOULD be allocated to\n   the MN.  The
    LMA MUST follow the procedure of PMIPv6 to make sure\n   that only an authorized
    HNP can be assigned for the MN.  In this way,\n   the LMA is ready to be the topological
    anchor point of the new HNP,\n   which is for that MN's exclusive use.\n   Per
    [RFC4862], if the Valid Lifetime in a Prefix Information Option\n   is set to
    less than 2 hours in an unauthenticated RA, it is ignored.\n   Thus, when the
    old HNP that is being deprecated is included in an RA\n   from the MAG, the Valid
    Lifetime SHOULD be set to 2 hours (and the\n   Preferred Lifetime set to 0) for
    an unauthenticated RA.  However, if\n   the legality of the signaling messages
    exchanged between MAG and MN\n   can be guaranteed, it MAY be acceptable to also
    set the Valid\n   Lifetime to 0 for an unauthenticated RA.\n"
