Abstract This document seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in currently deployed IETF Internet Area documented standards.
In order to successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all IPv6 Internet, many interim steps will be taken.
One of these steps is the evolution of current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.
It is hoped that these protocols (and their implementations) will be redesigned to be network address independent, but failing that will at least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.
To this end, all Standards (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will be surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.
This document is part of a document set aiming to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in IETF standards.
In an effort to have the information in a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 documents conforming to the current IETF areas (Application, Internet, Management & Operations, Routing, Security, Sub IP and Transport).
This specific document focuses on usage of IPv4 addresses within the Internet area.
For a full introduction, please see the introduction [1] document.
The following sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis of Full, Draft, and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.
Each RFC is discussed in turn starting with RFC 1 and ending in (about) RFC 3100.
The comments for each RFC are "raw" in nature.
That is, each RFC is discussed in a vacuum and problems or issues discussed do not "look ahead" to see if any of the issues raised have already been fixed.
Section 7 is an analysis of the data presented in Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6.
It is here that all of the results are considered as a whole and the problems that have been resolved in later RFCs are correlated.
Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred to as "Standards") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely implemented and used throughout the Internet.
This specification defines IPv4; IPv6 has been specified in separate documents.
RFC 792 Internet Control Message Protocol
This specification defines ICMP, and is inherently IPv4 dependent.
RFC 826 Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 891 DCN Local Network Protocols
There are many implicit assumptions about the use of IPv4 addresses in this document.
RFC 894 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams over Ethernet networks
This specification specifically deals with the transmission of IPv4 packets over Ethernet.
RFC 895 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams over experimental Ethernet networks
This specification specifically deals with the transmission of IPv4 packets over experimental Ethernet.
RFC 903 Reverse Address Resolution Protocol
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 919 Broadcasting Internet Datagrams
This specification defines broadcasting for IPv4; IPv6 uses multicast
so this is not applicable.
RFC 922 Broadcasting Internet datagrams in the presence of subnets
This specification defines how broadcasts should be treated in the presence of subnets.
IPv6 uses multicast so this is not applicable.
RFC 950 Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure
This specification defines IPv4 subnetting; similar functionality is part of IPv6 addressing architecture to begin with.
RFC 1034 Domain Names: Concepts and Facilities In Section 3.6, "Resource Records",
the definition of A record is:
Host name to host address translation.
This function is often defined to mimic a previous HOSTS.TXT based function.
Given a character string, the caller wants one or more 32 bit IP addresses.
Under the DNS, it translates into a request for type A RRs.
Since the DNS does not preserve the order of RRs, this function may choose to sort the returned addresses or select the "best" address if the service returns only one choice to the client.
Note that a multiple address return is recommended, but a single address may be the only way to emulate prior HOSTS.TXT services.
Host address to host name translation
This function will often follow the form of previous functions.
Given a 32 bit IP address, the caller wants a character string.
The octets of the IP address are reversed, used as name components, and suffixed with "IN ADDR.ARPA".
A type PTR query is used to get the RR with the primary name of the host.
For example, a request for the host name corresponding to IP address 1.2.3.4 looks for PTR RRs for domain name "4.3.2.1.IN ADDR.ARPA".
There are, of course, numerous examples of IPv4 addresses scattered throughout the document.
Hosts that have multiple Internet addresses will have multiple A records.
A records cause no additional section processing.
The RDATA section of an A line in a master file is an Internet address expressed as four decimal numbers separated by dots without any embedded spaces (e.g.,"10.2.0.52" or "192.0.5.6").
A variable length bit map.
The bit map must be a multiple of 8 bits long.
The WKS record is used to describe the well known services supported by a particular protocol on a particular internet address.
The PROTOCOL field specifies an IP protocol number, and the bit map has one bit per port of the specified protocol.
The first bit corresponds to port 0, the second to port 1, etc.
If the bit map does not include a bit for a protocol of interest, that bit is assumed zero.
The appropriate values and mnemonics for ports and protocols are specified in RFC1010.
For example, if PROTOCOL TCP (6), the 26th bit corresponds to TCP port 25 (SMTP).
If this bit is set, a SMTP server should be listening on TCP port 25; if zero, SMTP service is not supported on the specified address.
The purpose of WKS RRs is to provide availability information for servers for TCP and UDP.
If a server supports both TCP and UDP, or has multiple Internet addresses, then multiple WKS RRs are used.
WKS RRs cause no additional section processing.
Section 3.5, "IN ADDR.ARPA domain", describes reverse DNS lookups and is clearly IPv4 dependent.
There are, of course, numerous examples of IPv4 addresses scattered throughout the document.
RFC 1042 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams over IEEE 802 networks
This specification specifically deals with the transmission of IPv4 packets over IEEE 802 networks.
RFC 1044 Internet Protocol on Network System's HYPERchannel:
There are a variety of methods used in this standard to map IPv4 addresses to 32 bits fields in the HYPERchannel headers.
This specification does not support IPv6. 3.15.
RFC 1055 Nonstandard for transmission of IP datagrams over serial lines: SLIP
This specification is more of an analysis of the shortcomings of SLIP which is unsurprising.
The introduction of PPP as a general replacement of SLIP has made this specification essentially unused.
No update need be considered.
RFC 1088 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams over NetBIOS networks
This specification documents a technique to encapsulate IP packets inside NetBIOS packets.
The technique presented of using NetBIOS names of the form IP.XX.XX.XX.XX will not work for IPv6 addresses since the length of IPv6 addresses will not fit within the NetBIOS 15 octet name limitation.
RFC 1112 Host Extensions for IP Multicasting
This specification defines IP multicast.
Parts of the document are IPv4 dependent.
RFC 1132 Standard for the transmission of 802.2 packets over IPX networks
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 1201 Transmitting IP traffic over ARCNET networks
The major concerns of this specification with respect to IPv4 addresses occur in the resolution of ARCnet 8bit
addresses to IPv4 addresses in an "ARPlike" method.
This is incompatible with IPv6.
The Transmission of IP Datagrams over the SMDS Service
This specification defines running IPv4 and ARP over SMDS.
The methods described could easily be extended to support IPv6 packets.
RFC 1390 Transmission of IP and ARP over FDDI Networks
This specification defines the use of IPv4 address on FDDI networks.
There are numerous IPv4 dependencies in the specification.
In particular the value of the Protocol Type Code (2048 for IPv4) and a corresponding Protocol Address length (4 bytes for IPv4) needs to be created.
A discussion of broadcast and multicast addressing techniques is also included, and similarly must be updated for IPv6 networks.
The defined MTU limitation of 4096 octets of data (with 256 octets reserved header space) should remain sufficient for IPv6.
The Point to Point Protocol (PPP) There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 1662 PPP in HDLC like Framing There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 2427 Multiprotocol Interconnect over Frame Relay
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
Draft Standards Draft Standards represent the penultimate standard level in the IETF.
A protocol can only achieve draft standard when there are multiple, independent, interoperable implementations.
Draft Standards are usually quite mature and widely used.
RFC 951 Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
This protocol is designed specifically for use with IPv4, for example: Section 3.
All numbers shown are decimal, unless indicated otherwise.
The BOOTP packet is enclosed in a standard IP UDP datagram.
For simplicity it is assumed that the BOOTP packet is never fragmented.
Any numeric fields shown are packed in 'standard network byte order', i.e., high order bits are sent first.
In the IP header of a bootrequest, the client fills in its own IP source address if known, otherwise zero.
When the server address is unknown, the IP destination address will be the 'broadcast address' 255.255.255.255.
This address means 'broadcast on the local cable, (I don't know my net number)'.
Since the packet format is a fixed 300 bytes in length, an updated version of the specification could easily accommodate an additional 48 bytes (4 IPv6 fields of 16 bytes to replace the existing 4 IPv4 fields of 4 bytes).
RFC 1188 Proposed Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams over FDDI Networks
This document is clearly informally superseded by RFC 1390, "Transmission of IP and ARP over FDDI Networks", even though no formal deprecation has been done.
Therefore, this specification is not considered further in this memo.
RFC 1191 Path MTU discovery
The entire process of PMTU discovery is predicated on the use of the DF bit in the IPv4 header, an ICMP message (also IPv4 dependent) and TCP MSS option.
This is not compatible with IPv6.
RFC 1356 Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN Section 3.2 defines an NLPID for IP as follows:
The value hex CC (binary 11001100, decimal 204) is IP.
Conformance with this specification requires that IP be supported.
See section 5.1 for a diagram of the packet formats.
Clearly a new NLPID would need to be defined for IPv6 packets.
RFC 1534 Interoperation Between DHCP and BOOTP
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 1542 Clarifications and Extensions for the Bootstrap Protocol
There are no new issues other than those presented in Section 4.1.
RFC 1629 Guidelines for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
The PPP DECnet Phase IV Control Protocol (DNCP)
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 1989 PPP Link Quality Monitoring
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
The PPP Multilink Protocol (MP) Section 5.1.3, "Endpoint Discriminator Option", defines a Class header field:
Class The Class field is one octet and indicates the identifier address space.
The most up to date values of the LCP Endpoint Discriminator Class field are specified in the most recent "Assigned Numbers" RFC.
Current values are assigned as follows: 0
Null Class 1    Locally Assigned Address 2    Internet Protocol
(IP) Address 3    IEEE 802.1 Globally Assigned MAC Address 4
PPP Magic Number Block 5    Public Switched Network Directory Number
A new class field needs to be defined by the IANA for IPv6 addresses.
RFC 1994 PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 2067 IP over HIPPI Section 5.1, "Packet Formats", contains the following excerpt: EtherType (16 bits) SHALL be set as defined in Assigned Numbers:  IP   2048 ('0800'h), ARP   2054 ('0806'h), RARP   32,821 ('8035'h).
Section 5.5, "MTU", has the following definition: The MTU for HIPPI SC LANs is 65280 bytes.
This value was selected because it allows the IP packet to fit in one 64K byte buffer with up to 256 bytes of overhead.
The overhead is 40 bytes at the present time; there are 216 bytes of room for expansion.
Maximum IP packet size (MTU)
This definition is not applicable for IPv6 packets since packets can be larger than the IPv4 limitation of 65280 bytes.
RFC 2131 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
This version of DHCP is highly predicated of IPv4.
It is not compatible with IPv6.
RFC 2132 DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions
This is an extension to an IPv4 only specification.
RFC 2390 Inverse Address Resolution Protocol
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
This document defines IPv6 and has no IPv4 issues.
RFC 2461 Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6
This document defines an IPv6 related specification and has no IPv4 issues.
RFC 2462 IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
This document defines an IPv6 related specification and has no IPv4 issues.
RFC 2463 Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6
This document defines an IPv6 related specification and has no IPv4 issues.
RFC 3596 DNS Extensions to support IP version 6
This specification defines the AAAA record for IPv6 as well as PTR records using the ip6.arpa domain, and as such has no IPv6 issues.
Proposed Standards Proposed Standards are introductory level documents.
There are no requirements for even a single implementation.
In many cases, Proposed are never implemented or advanced in the IETF standards process.
They, therefore, are often just proposed ideas that are presented to the Internet community.
Sometimes flaws are exposed or they are one of many competing solutions to problems.
In these later cases, no discussion is presented as it would not serve the purpose of this discussion.
RFC 1234 Tunneling IPX traffic through IP networks
The section "Unicast Address Mappings" has the following text:
For implementations of this memo, the first two octets of the host number will always be zero and the last four octets will be the node's four octet IP address.
This makes address mapping trivial for unicast transmissions: the first two octets of the host number are discarded, leaving the normal four octet IP address.
The encapsulation code should use this IP address as the destination address of the UDP/IP tunnel packet.
This mapping will not be able to work with IPv6 addresses.
There are also numerous discussions on systems keeping a "peer list" to map between IP and IPX addresses.
The specifics are not discussed in the document and are left to the individual implementation.
The section "Maximum Transmission Unit" also has some implications on IP addressing: Although larger IPX packets are possible, the standard maximum transmission unit for IPX is 576 octets.
Consequently, 576 octets is the recommended default maximum transmission unit for IPX packets being sent with this encapsulation technique.
With the eight octet UDP header and the 20 octet IP header, the resulting IP packets will be 604 octets long.
Note that this is larger than
the 576 octet maximum size IP implementations are required to accept.
Any IP implementation supporting this encapsulation technique must be capable of receiving 604 octet IP packets.
As improvements in protocols and hardware allow for larger, unfragmented IP transmission units, the 576 octet maximum IPX packet size may become a liability.
For this reason, it is recommended that the IPX maximum transmission unit size be configurable in implementations of this memo.
RFC 1256 ICMP Router Discovery Messages
This specification defines a mechanism very specific to IPv4.
RFC 1277 Encoding Network Addresses to Support Operation over Non OSI Lower Layers Section 4.5, "TCP/IP (RFC 1006)
Network Specific Format" describes a structure that reserves 12 digits for the textual representation of an IP address.
This 12 octet field for decimal versions of IP addresses is insufficient for a decimal version of IPv6 addresses.
It is possible to define a new encoding using the 20 digit long IP Address   Port   Transport Set fields in order to accommodate a binary version of an IPv6 address, port number and Transport Set.
There are several schemes that could be envisioned.
The PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)
This specification defines a mechanism for devices to assign IPv4 addresses to PPP clients once PPP negotiation is completed.
Section 3, "IPCP Configuration Options", defines IPCP option types which embed the IP address in 4 byte long fields.
This is clearly not enough for IPv6.
However, the specification is clearly designed to allow new Option Types to be added and Should offer no problems for use with IPv6 once appropriate options have been defined.
The PPP OSI Network Layer Control Protocol (OSINLCP)
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
The PPP AppleTalk Control Protocol (ATCP)

RFC 2136 Dynamic Updates in the Domain Name System (DNS UPDATE)
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
RFC 2181 Clarifications to the DNS Specification
There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.
The only reference to IP addresses discuss the use of an anycast address,
so but one can assume that these techniques are IPv6 operable.
RFC 2225 Classical IP and ARP over ATM From the many references in this document, it is clear that this document is designed for IPv4 only.
It is only later in the document that it is implicitly stated, as in:
ar$spln  length in octets of the source protocol address.
Value range is 0 or 4 (decimal).
For IPv4 ar$spln is 4.
length in octets of the target protocol address.
Value range is 0 or 4 (decimal).
For IPv4 ar$tpln is 4.
and: For backward compatibility with previous implementations, a null IPv4 protocol address may be received with length   4 and an allocated address in storage set to the value 0.0.0.0.
Receiving stations must be liberal in accepting this format of a null IPv4 address.
However, on transmitting an ATMARP or InATMARP packet, a null IPv4 address must only be indicated by the length set to zero and must have no storage allocated.
RFC 2226 IP Broadcast over ATM Networks
This document is limited to IPv4 multicasting.
This is incompatible with IPv6.
RFC 2241 DHCP Options for Novell Directory Services
This is an extension to an IPv4 only specification.
RFC 2242 NetWare/IP Domain Name and Information
This is an extension to an IPv4 only specification, for example: PREFERRED DSS (code 6)
Length is (n   4) and the value is an array of n IP addresses, each four bytes in length.
The maximum number of addresses is 5 and therefore the maximum length value is 20.
The list contains the addresses of n NetWare Domain SAP/RIP Server (DSS).
(code 7) Length is (n   4) and the value is an array of n IP addresses, each four bytes in length.
The maximum number of addresses is 5 and therefore the maximum length value is 20.
The list contains the addresses of n Nearest NetWare/IP servers.
PRIMARY DSS (code 11) Length of 4, and the value is a single IP address.
This field identifies the Primary Domain SAP/RIP Service server (DSS) for this NetWare/IP domain.
NetWare/IP administration utility uses this value as Primary DSS server when configuring a secondary DSS server.
RFC 2290 Mobile IPv4 Configuration Option for PPP IPCP
This document is designed for use with Mobile IPv4.
There are numerous referrals to other IP "support" mechanisms (i.e., ICMP Router Discover Messages) that specifically refer to the IPv4 of ICMP.
RFC 2308 Negative Caching of DNS Queries (DNS NCACHE)
Although there are numerous examples in this document that use IPv4 "A" records, there is nothing in the specification that limits its effectiveness to IPv4. 5.38.

Transaction Internet Protocol Version 3.0
TIP transaction manager addresses take the form:
The <hostport> component comprises: <host>[:<port>]
where <host> is either a <dns name> or an <ip address>; and <port> is a decimal number specifying the port at which the transaction manager (or proxy) is listening for requests to establish TIP connections.
If the port number is omitted, the standard TIP port number (3372) is used.
> is a standard name, acceptable to the domain name service.
It must be sufficiently qualified to be useful to the receiver of the command.
> is an IP address, in the usual form: four decimal numbers separated by period characters.
And further along it states: A TIP URL takes the form: tip://<transaction manager address>?<transaction string> where <transaction manager address
> identifies the TIP transaction manager (as defined in Section 7 above); and <transaction string
> specifies a transaction identifier, which may take one of two forms (standard or non standard)
A standard transaction identifier, conforming to the proposed Internet Standard for Uniform Resource Names (URNs), as specified by RFC2141; where <NID> is the Namespace Identifier, and <NSS> is the Namespace Specific String.
The Namespace ID determines the syntactic interpretation of the Namespace Specific String.
The Namespace Specific String is a sequence of characters representing a transaction identifier (as defined by <NID>).
The rules for the contents of these fields are specified by RFC2141 (valid characters, encoding, etc.).
This format of <transaction string> may be used to express global transaction identifiers in terms of standard representations.
might be <iso> or <xopen>, e.g.,
tip://123.123.123.123/?urn:xopen:xid Note that Namespace Ids require registration.
In this non standard case, it is the combination of <transaction manager address> and <transaction identifier> which ensures global uniqueness, e.g., tip://123.123.123.123/?transid1 These are incompatible with IPv6. 5.45.
