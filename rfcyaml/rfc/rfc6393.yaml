- title: 2.  Moving RFC 4693 to Historic Status
  contents:
  - "2.  Moving RFC 4693 to Historic Status\n   RFC 4693 [RFC4693] established the\
    \ IETF Operational Notes (IONs)\n   series of documents on the experimental basis\
    \ [RFC3933].  This series\n   was intended to discuss the set of procedures that\
    \ the IETF follows,\n   but for which the RFC publication process is an inappropriate\n\
    \   documentation vehicle.\n   Per RFC 3933 [RFC3933], in March 2008, the IESG\
    \ decided to terminate\n   the IONs process experiment [IESG-IONS].  This document\
    \ moves RFC\n   4693 to Historic status, per [HISTORIC], to reflect experiment\n\
    \   closure.  Please contact the IESG at <iesg@ietf.org> for further\n   details,\
    \ including motivation for the termination and further destiny\n   of IONs.\n"
