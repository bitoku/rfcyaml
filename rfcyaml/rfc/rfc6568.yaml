- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) is the term commonly\
    \ used to\n   refer to networks made of highly constrained nodes (limited CPU,\n\
    \   memory, power) interconnected by a variety of \"lossy\" links\n   (low-power\
    \ radio links or Power-Line Communication (PLC)).  They are\n   characterized\
    \ by low speed, low performance, low cost, and unstable\n   connectivity.  A LoWPAN\
    \ is a particular instance of an LLN, formed by\n   devices complying with the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 standard [5].  Their typical\n   characteristics can be summarized\
    \ as follows:\n   o  Limited Processing Capability: The smallest common LoWPAN\
    \ nodes\n      have 8-bit processors with clock rates around 10 MHz.  Other\n\
    \      models exist with 16-bit and 32-bit cores (typically ARM7),\n      running\
    \ at frequencies on the order of tens of MHz.\n   o  Small Memory Capacity: The\
    \ smallest common LoWPAN nodes have a few\n      kilobytes of RAM with a few dozen\
    \ kilobytes of ROM/flash memory.\n      While memory sizes of nodes continue to\
    \ grow (e.g., IMote has 64\n      KB SRAM, 512 KB Flash memory), the nature of\
    \ small memory capacity\n      for LoWPAN nodes remains a challenge.\n   o  Low\
    \ Power: Wireless radios for LoWPANs are normally\n      battery-operated.  Their\
    \ radio frequency (RF) transceivers often\n      have a current draw of about\
    \ 10 to 30 mA, depending on the used\n      transmission power level.  In order\
    \ to reach common indoor ranges\n      of up to 30 meters and outdoor ranges of\
    \ 100 meters, the used\n      transmission power is set around 0 to 3 dBm.  Depending\
    \ on the\n      processor type, there is an additional battery current consumption\n\
    \      of the CPU itself, commonly on the order of tens of milliamperes.\n   \
    \   However, the CPU power consumption can often be reduced by a\n      thousandfold\
    \ when switching to sleep mode.\n   o  Short Range: The Personal Operating Space\
    \ (POS) defined by\n      IEEE 802.15.4 implies a range of 10 meters.  For real\n\
    \      implementations, the range of LoWPAN radios is typically measured\n   \
    \   in tens of meters, but can reach over 100 meters in line-of-sight\n      situations.\n\
    \   o  Low Bit Rate: The IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines a maximum\n      over-the-air\
    \ rate of 250 kbit/s, which is most commonly used in\n      current deployments.\
    \  Alternatively, three lower data rates of 20,\n      40, and 100 kbit/s are\
    \ defined.\n   As with any other LLN, a LoWPAN is not necessarily comprised of\n\
    \   sensor nodes only, but may also consist of actuators.  For instance,\n   in\
    \ an agricultural environment, sensor nodes might be used to detect\n   low soil\
    \ humidity and then send commands to activate the sprinkler\n   system.\n   After\
    \ defining common terminology in Section 1.1 and describing the\n   characteristics\
    \ of LoWPANs in Section 2, this document provides a\n   list of use cases and\
    \ market domains that may benefit and motivate\n   the work currently done in\
    \ the 6LoWPAN Working Group.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   Readers are expected to be familiar with all terms and\
    \ concepts\n   discussed in \"IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks\n\
    \   (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and Goals\" [2],\n \
    \  and \"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks\" [3].\n   Readers\
    \ would benefit from reading 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (ND)\n   [6], 6LoWPAN\
    \ header compression [7], and 6LoWPAN routing requirements\n   [8] for details\
    \ of 6LoWPAN work.\n   This document defines the following terms:\n   LC (Local\
    \ Controller)\n      A logical functional entity that performs the special role\
    \ of\n      coordinating and controlling its child nodes for local data\n    \
    \  aggregation, status management of local nodes, etc.  There may be\n      multiple\
    \ instances of local controller nodes in a LoWPAN.\n   LBR (LoWPAN Border Router)\n\
    \      A border router located at the junction of separate LoWPANs or\n      between\
    \ a LoWPAN and another IP network.  There may be one or more\n      LBRs at the\
    \ LoWPAN boundary.  An LBR is the responsible authority\n      for IPv6 Prefix\
    \ propagation for the LoWPAN it serves.  An isolated\n      LoWPAN also contains\
    \ an LBR in the network; the LBR provides the\n      prefix(es) for the isolated\
    \ network.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Premise of Network Configuration
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Premise of Network Configuration\n   The IEEE 802.15.4 standard distinguishes\
    \ between two types of nodes\n   -- reduced-function devices (RFDs) and full-function\
    \ devices (FFDs).\n   As this distinction is based on some Medium Access Control\
    \ (MAC)\n   features that are not always in use, we are not using this\n   distinction\
    \ in this document.\n   6LoWPANs can be deployed using either route-over or mesh-under\n\
    \   architectures.  As the choice of route-over or mesh-under does not\n   affect\
    \ the applicability of 6LoWPAN technologies to the use cases\n   described in\
    \ the document, we will use the term \"6LoWPAN\" to mean\n   either a route-over\
    \ or mesh-under network.\n   Communication to corresponding nodes outside of the\
    \ LoWPAN is\n   becoming increasingly important for convenient data collection\
    \ and\n   remote-control purposes.  The intermediate LoWPAN nodes act as packet\n\
    \   forwarders on the link layer or as LoWPAN routers, and connect the\n   entire\
    \ LoWPAN in a multi-hop fashion.  LBRs are used to interconnect\n   a LoWPAN to\
    \ other networks, or to form an extended LoWPAN by\n   connecting multiple LoWPANs.\
    \  Before LoWPAN nodes obtain their IPv6\n   addresses and the network is configured,\
    \ each LoWPAN executes a\n   link-layer configuration either by the mechanisms\
    \ specified in [6] or\n   by using a coordinator that is responsible for link-layer\
    \ short\n   address allocation.  However, the link-layer coordinator\n   functionality\
    \ is out of the scope of this document.  Details of\n   address allocation in\
    \ 6LoWPAN ND are in [6].\n   A LoWPAN can be configured as mesh-under or route-over\
    \ (see\n   Terminology in [6]).  In a route-over configuration, multi-hop\n  \
    \ transmission is carried out by LoWPAN routers using IP routing.  In a\n   mesh-under\
    \ configuration, the link-local scope reaches to the\n   boundaries of the LoWPAN,\
    \ and multi-hop transmission is achieved by\n   forwarding data at the link layer\
    \ or in a 6LoWPAN adaptation layer.\n   More information about mesh-under and\
    \ route-over is in [6] and [8].\n"
- title: 2.  Design Space
  contents:
  - "2.  Design Space\n   Inspired by [9], this section lists the dimensions used\
    \ to describe\n   the design space of wireless sensor networks in the context\
    \ of the\n   6LoWPAN Working Group.  The design space is already limited by the\n\
    \   unique characteristics of a LoWPAN (e.g., low power, short range, low\n  \
    \ bit rate), as described in [2].  The possible dimensions for scenario\n   categorization\
    \ used in this document are described as follows:\n   o  Deployment: LoWPAN nodes\
    \ can be scattered randomly, or they may be\n      deployed in an organized manner\
    \ in a LoWPAN.  The deployment can\n      occur at once, or as an iterative process.\
    \  The selected type of\n      deployment has an impact on node density and location.\
    \  This\n      feature affects how to organize (manually or automatically) the\n\
    \      LoWPAN and how to allocate addresses in the network.\n   o  Network Size:\
    \ The network size takes into account nodes that\n      provide the intended network\
    \ capability.  The number of nodes\n      involved in a LoWPAN could be small\
    \ (ten), moderate (several\n      hundred), or large (over a thousand).\n   o\
    \  Power Source: The power source of nodes, whether the nodes are\n      battery-powered\
    \ or mains-powered, influences the network design.\n      The power may also be\
    \ harvested from solar cells or other sources\n      of energy.  Hybrid solutions\
    \ are possible where only part of the\n      network is mains-powered.\n   o \
    \ Connectivity: Nodes within a LoWPAN are considered \"always\n      connected\"\
    \ when there is a network connection between any two\n      given nodes.  However,\
    \ due to external factors (e.g., extreme\n      environment, mobility) or programmed\
    \ disconnections (e.g.,\n      sleeping mode), network connectivity can be from\
    \ \"intermittent\"\n      (i.e., regular disconnections) to \"sporadic\" (i.e.,\
    \ almost always\n      disconnected).  Differences in L2 duty-cycling settings\
    \ may\n      additionally impact connectivity due to highly varying bit rates.\n\
    \   o  Multi-Hop Communication: The multi-hop communication factor\n      highlights\
    \ the number of hops that have to be traversed to reach\n      the edge of the\
    \ network or a destination node within it.  A single\n      hop may be sufficient\
    \ for simple star topologies, but a multi-hop\n      communication scheme is required\
    \ for more elaborate topologies,\n      such as meshes or trees.  In previous\
    \ work on LoWPANs by academia\n      and industry, various routing mechanisms\
    \ were introduced, such as\n      data-centric, event-driven, address-centric,\
    \ localization-based,\n      geographical routing, etc.  This document does not\
    \ make use of\n      such a fine granularity but rather uses topologies and single/\n\
    \      multi-hop communication.\n   o  Traffic Pattern: Several traffic patterns\
    \ may be used in LoWPANs\n      -- Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP), Multipoint-to-Point\
    \ (MP2P), and\n      Point-to-Point (P2P), to name a few.\n   o  Security Level:\
    \ LoWPANs may carry sensitive information and\n      require high-level security\
    \ support where the availability,\n      integrity, and confidentiality of the\
    \ information are crucial.\n   o  Mobility: Inherent to the wireless characteristics\
    \ of LoWPANs,\n      nodes could move or be moved around.  Mobility can be an\
    \ induced\n      factor (e.g., sensors in an automobile) -- and hence not\n  \
    \    predictable -- or a controlled characteristic (e.g., pre-planned\n      movement\
    \ in a supply chain).\n   o  Quality of Service (QoS): QoS issues in LoWPANs may\
    \ be very\n      different from the traditional end-to-end QoS, as in LoWPAN\n\
    \      applications one end is not a single sensor node but often a group\n  \
    \    of sensor nodes.  Parameters for QoS should consider collective\n      data\
    \ for latency, packet loss, data throughput, etc.  In addition,\n      QoS requirements\
    \ can be different based on the data delivery\n      model, such as event-driven,\
    \ query-driven, continuous real-time,\n      or continuous non-real-time; these\
    \ delivery models usually coexist\n      in LoWPAN applications.  QoS issues in\
    \ LoWPANs are more likely\n      related to corresponding application-specific\
    \ data delivery\n      requirements within resource-constrained LoWPANs.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Industrial Monitoring
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Industrial Monitoring\n   LoWPAN applications for industrial monitoring\
    \ can be associated with\n   a broad range of methods to increase productivity,\
    \ energy efficiency,\n   and safety of industrial operations in engineering facilities\
    \ and\n   manufacturing plants.  Many companies currently use time-consuming\n\
    \   and expensive manual monitoring to predict failures and to schedule\n   maintenance\
    \ or replacements in order to avoid costly manufacturing\n   downtime.  LoWPANs\
    \ can be inexpensively installed to provide more\n   frequent and more reliable\
    \ data.  The deployment of LoWPANs can\n   reduce equipment downtime and eliminate\
    \ manual equipment monitoring\n   that is costly to perform.  Additionally, data\
    \ analysis functionality\n   can be placed into the network, eliminating the need\
    \ for manual data\n   transfer and analysis.\n   Industrial monitoring can be\
    \ largely split into the following\n   application fields:\n   o  Process Monitoring\
    \ and Control: This application field combines\n      advanced energy metering\
    \ and sub-metering technologies with\n      wireless sensor networking in order\
    \ to optimize factory\n      operations, reduce peak demand, ultimately lower\
    \ costs for energy,\n      avoid machine downtimes, and increase operation safety.\n\
    \      A plant's monitoring boundary often does not cover the entire\n      facility\
    \ but only those areas considered critical to the process.\n      Wireless connectivity\
    \ that is easy to install extends this line to\n      include peripheral areas\
    \ and process measurements that were\n      previously infeasible or impractical\
    \ to reach with wired\n      connections.\n   o  Machine Surveillance: This application\
    \ field ensures product\n      quality and efficient and safe equipment operation.\
    \  Critical\n      equipment parameters such as vibration, temperature, and\n\
    \      electrical signature are analyzed for abnormalities that are\n      suggestive\
    \ of impending equipment failure.\n   o  Supply Chain Management and Asset Tracking:\
    \ With the retail\n      industry being legally responsible for the quality of\
    \ sold goods,\n      early detection of inadequate storage conditions with respect\
    \ to\n      temperature will reduce the risk and cost of removing products\n \
    \     from the sales channel.  Examples include container shipping,\n      product\
    \ identification, cargo monitoring, distribution, and\n      logistics.\n   o\
    \  Storage Monitoring: This application field includes sensor systems\n      designed\
    \ to prevent releases of regulated substances into ground\n      water, surface\
    \ water, and soil.  This application field may also\n      include theft/tampering\
    \ prevention systems for storage facilities\n      or other infrastructure, such\
    \ as pipelines.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  A Use Case and Its Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  A Use Case and Its Requirements\n   Example: Hospital Storage Rooms\n\
    \   In a hospital, maintenance of the right temperature in storage rooms\n   is\
    \ very critical.  Red blood cells need to be stored at 2 to 6\n   degrees Celsius,\
    \ blood platelets at 20 to 24 degrees C, and blood\n   plasma below -18 degrees\
    \ C.  For anti-cancer medicine, maintaining a\n   humidity of 45% to 55% is required.\
    \  Storage rooms have temperature\n   sensors and humidity sensors every 25 to\
    \ 100 m, based on the floor\n   plan and the location of shelves, as indoor obstacles\
    \ distort the\n   radio signals.  At each blood pack, a sensor tag can be installed\
    \ to\n   track the temperature during delivery.  A LoWPAN node is installed in\n\
    \   each container of a set of blood packs.  In this case, highly dense\n   networks\
    \ must be managed.\n   All nodes are statically deployed and manually configured\
    \ with either\n   a single- or multi-hop connection.  Different types of LoWPAN\
    \ nodes\n   are configured based on the service and network requirements.  In\n\
    \   particular, LCs play a role in aggregation of the sensed data from\n   blood\
    \ packs.  In the extended networks, more than one LoWPAN LC can\n   be installed\
    \ in a storage room.  In the case that the sensed data\n   from an individual\
    \ node is urgent event-driven data such as outrange\n   of temperature or humidity,\
    \ it will not be accumulated (and further\n   delayed) by the LCs but immediately\
    \ relayed.\n   All LoWPAN nodes do not move unless the blood packs or a container\
    \ of\n   blood packs is moved.  Moving nodes get connected by logical\n   attachment\
    \ to a new LoWPAN.  When containers of blood packs are\n   transferred to another\
    \ place in the hospital or by ambulance, the\n   LoWPAN nodes on the containers\
    \ associate to a new LoWPAN.\n   This type of application works based on both\
    \ periodic and\n   event-driven notifications.  Periodic data is used for monitoring\n\
    \   temperature and humidity in the storage rooms.  The data over or\n   under\
    \ a predefined threshold is meaningful to report.  Blood cannot\n   be used if\
    \ it is exposed to the wrong environment for about 30\n   minutes.  Thus, event-driven\
    \ data sensed on abnormal occurrences is\n   time-critical and requires secure\
    \ and reliable transmission.\n   LoWPANs must be provided with low installation\
    \ and management costs,\n   and for the transportation of blood containers, precise\
    \ location\n   tracking of containers is important.  The hospital network manager\
    \ or\n   staff can be provided with an early warning of possible chain\n   ruptures,\
    \ for example, by conveniently accessing comprehensive online\n   reports and\
    \ data management systems.\n   Dominant parameters in industrial monitoring scenarios:\n\
    \   o  Deployment: Pre-planned, manually attached.\n   o  Network Size: Medium\
    \ to large size, high node density.\n   o  Power Source: Battery-operated most\
    \ of the time.\n   o  Connectivity: Always on for crucial processes.\n   o  Multi-Hop\
    \ Communication: Multi-hop networking.\n   o  Traffic Pattern: P2P (actuator control),\
    \ MP2P (data collection).\n   o  Security Level: Business-critical.  Secure transmission\
    \ must be\n      guaranteed.\n   o  Mobility: None (except for asset tracking).\n\
    \   o  QoS: Important for time-critical event-driven data.\n   o  Other Issues:\
    \ Sensor network management, location tracking,\n      real-time early warning.\n"

    \ in a different way -- mesh topology -- as shown in\n   Figure 2.\n   Each LoWPAN\
    \ node may reach the LBR by a predefined routing/forwarding\n   mechanism.  Each\
    \ LoWPAN node configures its link-local address and\n   obtains a prefix from\
    \ its LBR by a 6LoWPAN ND procedure [6].  LoWPAN\n   nodes need to build a multi-hop\
    \ connection to reach the LCs and LBR.\n   Secure data transmission and authentication\
    \ are crucial in a hospital\n   scenario, to prevent personal information from\
    \ being retrieved by an\n   adversary.  Confidential data must be encrypted not\
    \ only in\n   transmission, but also when stored on nodes, because nodes can\n\
    \   potentially be stolen.\n   The data volume is usually not so large in this\
    \ case, but is\n   sensitive to delay.  Data aggregators can be installed for\
    \ each\n   storage room, or just one data aggregator can collect all data.  To\n\
    \   make a light transmission, UDP is likely to be chosen, but a secure\n   transmission\
    \ and security mechanism must be added.  To increase\n   security, link-layer\
    \ mechanisms and/or additional security mechanisms\n   should be used.\n   Because\
    \ a failure of a LoWPAN node can critically affect the storage\n   of the blood\
    \ packs, network management is important in this use case.\n   A lightweight management\
    \ mechanism must be provided for this\n   management.\n   The service quality\
    \ of this case is highly related to effective\n   handling of event-driven data\
    \ that is delay intolerant and mission\n   critical.  Wrong humidity and wrong\
    \ temperature are events that need\n   to be detected as quickly and reliably\
    \ as possible.  It is important\n   to provide efficient resource usage for such\
    \ data with consideration\n   of minimal usage of energy.  Energy-aware QoS support\
    \ in wireless\n   sensor networks is a challenging issue [12].  It can be considered\
    \ to\n   provide appropriate data aggregation for minimizing delay and\n   maximizing\
    \ accuracy of delivery by using power-affluent nodes, or can\n   be aided by middleware\
    \ or other types of network elements.\n   When a container is moved out of the\
    \ storage room and connected to\n   another hospital system (if the hospital buildings\
    \ are fully or\n   partly covered with LoWPANs), a mechanism to rebind to a new\
    \ parent\n   node and a new LoWPAN must be supported.  In the case that it is\n\
    \   moved by an ambulance, it will be connected to an LBR in the vehicle.\n  \
    \ This type of mobility is supported by the 6LoWPAN ND and routing\n   mechanism.\n\
    \   LoWPANs must be provided with low installation and management costs,\n   providing\
    \ benefits such as reduced inventory, and precise location\n   tracking of containers\
    \ and mobile equipment (e.g., beds moved in the\n   hospital, ambulances).\n \

    \  All nodes are placed statically and\n   manually configured with a single-hop\
    \ connection to the local\n   coordinator.  All LoWPAN nodes are immobile while\
    \ the service is\n   provided.  Except for the pillars, there are no special obstacles\n\
    \   causing attenuation of node signals, but careful configuration is\n   needed\
    \ to prevent signal interference between LoWPAN nodes.\n   The physical network\
    \ topology is changed in case of node failure.  On\n   the top part of each pillar,\
    \ a sink node is placed to collect the\n   sensed data.  The sink nodes of each\

    \ large sensor networks to\n   monitor a building or, for instance, the safety\
    \ status of highways\n   and tunnels.  Larger networks of the same kind still\
    \ have similar\n   characteristics, such as static node placement and manual deployment;\n\
    \   depending on the blueprint of the structure, mesh topologies will be\n   built\

    \ can be done via simple\n   topologies; however, there are many extended use\
    \ cases for more\n   complex structures.  The example bridge monitoring case may\
    \ be the\n   simplest case.  (An example topology is illustrated in Figure 3.)\n\
    \   The LoWPAN nodes are installed in place after manual optimization of\n   their\
    \ location.  As the communication of the leaf LoWPAN nodes may be\n   limited\
    \ to the data-gathering points, both 16-bit and 64-bit\n   addresses can be used\
    \ for IPv6 link-local addresses [3].\n   Each pillar might have one LC for data\
    \ collection.  Communication\n   schedules should be set up between leaf nodes\
    \ and their LC to\n   efficiently gather the different types of sensed data. \
    \ Each data\n   packet may include meta-information about its data, or the type\
    \ of\n   sensors could be encoded in its address during address allocation.\n\
    \   This type of application works based on periodic, query-driven, and\n   event-driven\
    \ notifications.  The data over or under a predefined\n   threshold is meaningful\

  - "3.3.1.  A Use Case and Its Requirements\n   Example: Home Automation\n   The\
    \ home automation and control system LoWPAN offers a wide range of\n   services:\
    \ local or remote access from the Internet (via a secured\n   edge router) to\
    \ monitor the home (temperature, humidity, activation\n   of remote video surveillance,\
    \ status of the doors (locked or open),\n   etc.), as well as home control (activate\
    \ air conditioning/heating,\n   door locks, sprinkler systems, etc.).  Fairly\
    \ sophisticated systems\n   can also optimize the level of energy consumption,\
    \ thanks to a wide\n   range of input from various sensors connected to the LoWPAN\
    \ -- light\n   sensors, presence detection, temperature, etc. -- in order to control\n\
    \   electric window shades, chillers, air flow control, air conditioning,\n  \
    \ and heating.\n   With the emergence of \"Smart Grid\" applications, the LoWPAN\
    \ may also\n   have direct interactions with the Grid itself via the Internet\
    \ to\n   report the amount of kilowatts that could be load-shed (home to Grid)\n\
    \   and to receive dynamic load-shedding information if/when required\n   (Grid\
    \ to home): This application is also referred to as a\n   Demand-Response application.\
    \  Another service, known as Demand-Side\n   Management (DSM), could be provided\
    \ by utilities to monitor and\n   report to the user his energy consumption, with\
    \ a fine granularity\n   (on a per-device basis).  A user can also receive other\
    \ inputs from\n   the utility, such as dynamic pricing; according to local policy,\
    \ the\n   utility may then turn some appliances on or off in order to reduce\n\
    \   its energy bill.\n   In terms of home safety and security, the LoWPAN is made\
    \ up of motion\n   sensors and audio sensors, sensors at doors and windows, and\
    \ video\n   cameras; additional sensors can be added for safety (gas, water, CO,\n\
    \   Radon, smoke detection).  The LoWPAN is typically comprised of a few\n   dozen\
    \ nodes forming an ad hoc network with multi-hop routing, since\n   the nodes\
    \ may not be in direct range.  It is worth mentioning that\n   the number of devices\
    \ tends to grow, considering the number of new\n   applications for the home.\
    \  In its simplest form, all nodes are\n   static and communicate with a central\
    \ control module, but more\n   sophisticated scenarios may also involve inter-device\
    \ communication.\n   For example, a motion/presence sensor may send a multicast\
    \ message to\n   a group of lights to be switched on, or a video camera may be\n\
    \   activated to send a video stream to a cell phone via a gateway.\n   Ergonomics\
    \ in connected homes is key, and the LoWPAN must be\n   self-managed and easy\
    \ to install.  Traffic patterns may vary greatly,\n   depending on applicability;\
    \ so does the level of reliability and QoS\n   expected from the LoWPAN.  Humidity\
    \ sensing is typically not critical\n   and requires no immediate action, whereas\
    \ tele-assistance or gas-leak\n   detection is critical and requires a high degree\
    \ of reliability.\n   Furthermore, although some actions may not involve critical\
    \ data, the\n   response time and network delays must still be on the order of\
    \ a few\n   hundred milliseconds for optimal user experience (e.g., use a remote\n\
    \   control to switch a light on).  A minority of nodes are mobile (with\n   slow\
    \ motion).  With the emergence of energy-related applications, it\n   becomes\
    \ crucial to preserve data confidentiality.  Connected home\n   LoWPANs usually\
    \ do not require multi-topology or QoS routing.  Fairly\n   simple QoS mechanisms\
    \ are enough for handling emergency data; they\n   can be programmed to alarm\
    \ via actuators or to operate sprinklers.\n   Dominant parameters for home automation\
    \ applications:\n   o  Deployment: Multi-hop topologies.\n   o  Network Size:\
    \ Medium number of nodes, potentially high density.\n   o  Power Source: Mix of\

    \ a vineyard of medium to large geographical size, between 50 and\n   100 LC nodes\
    \ are manually deployed in order to provide full signal\n   coverage over the\
    \ study area.  An additional 100 to 1000 leaf nodes\n   with (possibly heterogeneous)\
    \ specialized sensors (i.e., humidity,\n   temperature, soil condition, sunlight)\
    \ are attached to the LCs in\n   local wireless star topologies, periodically\
    \ reporting measurements\n   to the associated LCs.  For example, in a 20-acre\
    \ vineyard with 8\n   parcels of land, 10 LoWPAN nodes are placed within each\
    \ parcel to\n   provide readings on temperature and soil moisture.  The LoWPAN\
    \ nodes\n   are able to support a multi-hop forwarding/routing scheme to enable\n\
    \   data transmission to a sink node at the edge of the vineyard.  Each\n   of\

    \ Using manual deployment, device addresses can be used\n   for identifying their\

    \ algorithm needs to be applied.\n   There might be various types of sensor devices\
    \ deployed in a single\n   LoWPAN, each providing raw data with different semantics.\
    \  Thus, an\n   additional method is required to correctly interpret sensor readings.\n\
    \   Each data packet may include meta-information about its data, or the\n   type\
    \ of sensor could be encoded in its address during address\n   allocation.\n \

    \ machinery, and with growing crops and foliage.\n      LoWPAN nodes can be deployed\
    \ in a predefined manner, with\n      consideration given to harsh environments.\n\
    \   o  Network Size: Medium to large, low to medium density.\n   o  Power Source:\

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Relevant security considerations are listed by\
    \ application scenario\n   in Section 3.  The security considerations in RFC 4919\
    \ [2] and\n   RFC 4944 [3] apply as well.\n   The physical exposure of LoWPAN\
    \ nodes (especially in outdoor\n   networks) allows an adversary to capture, clone,\
    \ tamper with, or even\n   destroy these devices.  Given the safety issues involved\
    \ in some use\n   cases, these threats place high demands for resiliency and\n\
    \   survivability upon the LoWPAN.  The generally wireless channels of\n   LoWPANs\
    \ are susceptible to several security threats.  Without proper\n   security measures,\
    \ confidential information might be snooped by a\n   \"man in the middle\".  An\
    \ attacker might also modify or introduce data\n   packets into the network --\
    \ for example, to manipulate sensor\n   readings or to take control of sensors\
    \ and actuators.  This\n   specification expects that the link layer is sufficiently\
    \ protected,\n   either by means of physical or IP security for the backbone link\
    \ or\n   with MAC sublayer cryptography.  However, link-layer encryption and\n\
    \   authentication may not be sufficient to provide confidentiality,\n   authentication,\
    \ integrity, and freshness to both data and signaling\n   packets.\n   Due to\
    \ their low-power nature, LoWPANs are especially vulnerable to\n   denial-of-service\
    \ (DoS) attacks.  Example DoS attacks include\n   attempts to drain a node's battery\
    \ by excessive querying or to\n   introduce a high-power jamming signal that makes\
    \ LoWPAN nodes\n   dysfunctional.  Security solutions must therefore be lightweight\
    \ and\n   support node authentication, so that message integrity can be\n   guaranteed\
    \ and misbehaving nodes can be denied participation in the\n   network.  A node\
    \ must authenticate itself to trusted nodes before\n   taking part in the LoWPAN.\n\
    \   Considering the power constraints and limited processing capabilities\n  \
    \ of IEEE 802.15.4 devices, IPsec is computationally expensive;\n   Internet key\
    \ exchange (IKEv2) messaging as described in [4] is not\n   suited for LoWPANs,\
    \ as the amount of signaling in these networks\n   should be minimized.  Thus,\
    \ LoWPANs may need to define their own\n   key-management method that requires\
    \ minimum overhead in terms of\n   packet size and message exchange [11].  IPsec\
    \ provides authentication\n   and confidentiality between end nodes and across\
    \ multiple LoWPAN\n   links, and may be useful only when two nodes want to apply\
    \ security\n   to all exchanged messages.  However, in many cases, the security\
    \ may\n   be requested at the application layer as needed, while other messages\n\
    \   can flow in the network without security overhead.  Recent work [13]\n   shows\
    \ some promise for minimal IKEv2 implementations.\n   Security requirements may\
    \ differ by use case.  For example,\n   industrial and structural monitoring applications\
    \ are safety-critical\n   and secure transmission must be guaranteed, so that\
    \ only\n   authenticated users are able to access and handle the data.  In\n \
    \  healthcare systems, data privacy is an important issue.  Encryption\n   is\
    \ required, and role-based access control is needed for proper\n   authentication.\
    \  In home automation scenarios, critical applications\n   such as door locks\
    \ require high security and robustness against\n   intrusion.  On the other hand,\
    \ a remote-controlled light switch has\n   no critical security threats.\n"
