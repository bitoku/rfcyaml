- title: 1.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.  Background\n   The For Your Information (FYI) sub-series of RFCs was established\
    \ by\n   RFC 1150 [RFC1150] in 1990 for use by the IETF User Services Area,\n\
    \   which has not met since IETF 53 held in March 2001.  This RFC sub-\n   series\
    \ was designed to provide Internet users with a repository of\n   information\
    \ regarding the Internet that might be interesting to a\n   wide range of people.\n\
    \   The publication of RFC 1150 [RFC1150] introduced the FYI sub-series\n   of\
    \ RFCs.  Since that time, a total of 38 FYI numbers have been\n   assigned.  Many\
    \ other Informational RFCs have been published that are\n   not part of the FYI\
    \ sub-series.\n   The list of documents in the FYI sub-series can be found on\
    \ the RFC\n   Editor web site [INDEX].\n"
- title: 2.  Conclusion of the FYI Sub-Series
  contents:
  - "2.  Conclusion of the FYI Sub-Series\n   The IESG does not intend to make any\
    \ further additions to the FYI\n   sub-series.  The IESG intends to continue to\
    \ produce Informational\n   RFCs, but none of them will be assigned an FYI number.\n\
    \   All published RFCs that are currently part of the FYI sub-series will\n  \
    \ retain their FYI numbers.  The FYI numbers continue to provide\n   reference\
    \ points for these documents, and the FYI number can be used\n   in citations\
    \ to these documents.\n   If a future RFC is published that obsoletes an existing\
    \ member of the\n   FYI sub-series, the new RFC will not be assigned an FYI number.\n"
- title: 3.  RFC 1150 Moved to Historic
  contents:
  - "3.  RFC 1150 Moved to Historic\n   This document moves RFC 1150 [RFC1150] to\
    \ Historic.  The procedural\n   information in RFC 1150 is no longer valid.  If\
    \ it becomes desirable\n   to make additions to the FYI sub-series in the future,\
    \ new procedures\n   can be developed to replace this document.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   No Internet security issues are anticipated by\
    \ the actions described\n   in this document.\n"
