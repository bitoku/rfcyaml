  - "1.  Introduction\n   With the standardization of Internationalized Domain Names\
    \ for\n   Application (IDNA, described in [RFC3490], [RFC3491], and [RFC3492]),\n\
    \   internationalized domain names (IDNs), i.e., those that contain non-\n   ASCII\
    \ characters, are included in the DNS, and users can access the\n   Internet with\
    \ their native languages, most of which are not English.\n   However, many languages\
    \ have special requirements, which are not\n   addressed in the IDNA RFCs.  One\
    \ way to deal with some of the\n   remaining issues involves grouping characters\
    \ that could be confused\n   together as \"variants\".  The variant approach is\
    \ discussed in RFC\n   4290 [RFC4290] and specifically for documents written in\
    \ Chinese,\n   Japanese, or Korean (CJK documents), in the so-called \"JET\n \
    \  Guidelines\" RFC 3743 [RFC3743].  Readers of this document are assumed\n  \
    \ to be familiar with the concepts and terminology of the latter.  The\n   guidelines\
    \ specified in this document provide a set of specific\n   tables and methods\
    \ required to apply the JET Guidelines to Chinese\n   characters.  For example,\
    \ changes were made in the forms of a large\n   number of Chinese characters during\
    \ the last century to simplify\n   writing and reading.  These \"Simplified\"\
    \ characters have been adopted\n   in some Chinese-speaking communities, while\
    \ others continue to use\n   the \"Traditional\" forms.  On the global Internet,\
    \ if IDNA were used\n   alone, there would be considerable potential for confusion\
    \ if the two\n   forms were not considered together.  Consequently, effective\
    \ use of\n   Chinese Domain Names (CDNs) requires variant equivalence, as\n  \
    \ described in RFC 3743, to handle character differences between\n   Simplified\
    \ and Traditional Chinese forms.\n   Chinese variant equivalence itself is very\
    \ complicated in principle\n   (please read [C2C] for further information).  When\
    \ it comes to the\n   usage of Chinese domain names, the basic requirement is\
    \ to match the\n   user perception of Chinese characters between Simplified Chinese\
    \ (SC)\n   and Traditional Chinese (TC) forms.  When users register SC or TC\n\
    \   domain names, they will wish to obtain the other forms (Traditional\n   or\
    \ Simplified, respectively) as well, and expect others to be able to\n   access\
    \ the website or other resources in both forms.\n   This document specifies a\
    \ solution for Chinese domain name\n   registration and administration that has\
    \ been adopted and deployed by\n   CNNIC (the top-level domain registry for \"\
    CN\") and TWNIC (the top-\n   level domain registry for \"TW\") to manage Simplified\
    \ Chinese and\n   Traditional Chinese domain name equivalence.  In the terminology\
    \ of\n   RFC 3743, this solution is based on Internationalized Domain Labels\n\
    \   (IDLs).\n"

- title: 2.1.  Chinese Characters
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Chinese Characters\n   This document suggests permitting only a subset\
    \ of Chinese characters\n   in Chinese Domain Names (CDNs) and hence in the DNS.\
    \  When this\n   document discusses Chinese characters, it only refers to the\
    \ subset\n   of the characters in the first column of the current IANA\n   registration\
    \ tables for Chinese as discussed in Section 2.3 and\n   Section 2.4.  These are\
    \ defined, in detail, in [LVT-SC] and [LVT-TC].\n   Of course, characters excluded\
    \ from these tables are still valid\n   Chinese characters.  However, this document\
    \ strongly suggests that\n   registries do not permit any registration of Chinese\
    \ characters that\n   are not listed in the tables.  The tables themselves will\
    \ be updated\n   in the future if necessary.\n"

    \ (LDH) set as well as Chinese\n   characters.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Simplified Chinese Variant Table (SCVT)
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Simplified Chinese Variant Table (SCVT)\n   Based on RFC 3743 [RFC3743],\
    \ a language table for Simplified Chinese\n   has been defined [LVT-SC].  It can\
    \ be used for the registration of\n   Simplified Chinese domain names.  The key\
    \ feature of this table is\n   that the preferred variant is the SC character,\
    \ which is used by\n   Chinese mainland users or defined in Chinese-related standards.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Traditional Chinese Variant Table (TCVT)
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Traditional Chinese Variant Table (TCVT)\n   Similarly, a language table\
    \ has been defined for Traditional Chinese\n   [LVT-TC].  It is also based on\
    \ the rules of RFC 3743.  It can be used\n   for registration of Traditional Chinese\
    \ domain names.  The preferred\n   variant is the TC character, which is used\
    \ by Taiwan users or defined\n   in related standards.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Terminology and Context
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Terminology and Context\n   This document adopts the same procedure for\
    \ Chinese Domain Name Label\n   (CDNL) registration as the one defined for more\
    \ general IDN labels in\n   section 3.2.3 of RFC 3743 [RFC3743].  The terminology\
    \ and notation\n   used below, and the steps that are mentioned, derive from that\n\
    \   document.  In particular, \"CV\" is the character variant associated\n   with\
    \ an input character (\"IN\") and a language table.  The language\n   tables used\
    \ here are those for Chinese as spoken and written in the\n   Chinese mainland\
    \ (ZH-CN) and on Taiwan (ZH-TW).  \"PV\" is the selected\n   Preferred Variant.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Procedure in Terms of the RFC 3743 Model
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Procedure in Terms of the RFC 3743 Model\n   The first column of the Simplified\
    \ Chinese Variant Table (SCVT) is\n   the same as the first column of the corresponding\
    \ Traditional Chinese\n   Variant Table (TCVT) and so are the third columns of\
    \ both tables.\n   Consequently, the CV(IN, ZH-CN) will be same as the CV(IN,\
    \ ZH-TW)\n   after Step 3; the PV(IN, ZH-CN) is in SC form, and the PV(IN, ZH-TW)\n\
    \   is in TC form.  As a result, there will not be more than three\n   records\
    \ (i.e., for the original label (OCDNL), the Simplified Chinese\n   (SC) form,\
    \ and the Traditional Chinese (TC) form) to be added into\n   the zone file after\
    \ applying this procedure.  In other words, the\n   procedure does not generate\
    \ labels that contain a mixture of\n   Simplified and Traditional Chinese as variants.\n\
    \   The set of languages associated with the input (IN) is both ZH-CN and\n  \
    \ ZH-TW by default. The procedure for CDNL registration uses the\n   optional\
    \ registry-defined rules provided in RFC 3743 for optional\n   processing, with\
    \ the understanding that the rules may vary for\n   different registries supporting\
    \ CDNs.  The motivation for such rules\n   is described below.\n   The preferred\
    \ variant(s) is/are TC in TCVT, and SC in SCVT.  There\n   may be more than one\
    \ preferred variant for a given valid character.\n"
- title: 3.3.  RFC 3743 Optional Registry Processing
  contents:
  - "3.3.  RFC 3743 Optional Registry Processing\n   In actuality, while IDNA, and\
    \ hence RFC 3743, process characters one\n   at a time, the actual relationship\
    \ between the valid code point and\n   the preferred variant is contextual: whether\
    \ one character can be\n   substituted for another depends on the characters with\
    \ which it is\n   associated in a label or, more generally, in a phrase.  In\n\
    \   particular, some of the preferred variants make no sense in\n   combination\
    \ with other characters; therefore, those combinations\n   should not be added\
    \ into the Zone file (described as \"ZV\" or zone\n   variants in RFC 3743). \
    \ If desired, it should be possible to define\n   and implement rules to reduce\
    \ the preferred variant labels to only\n   plausible ones.  This could be done,\
    \ for example, with some\n   artificial intelligence tools, or with feedback from\
    \ the registrant,\n   or with selection based on frequency of occurrence in other\
    \ texts.\n   To illustrate one possibility, the OCDNL could be required to be\
    \ TC-\n   only or SC-only, and if there is more than one preferred variant, the\n\
    \   OCDNL will be used as the PV, instead of the PV produced by the\n   algorithm.\n\
    \   To reemphasize, the tables in [LVT-SC] and [LVT-TC] follow the table\n   format\
    \ and terminologies defined in [RFC3743].  If one intends to\n   implement Chinese\
    \ domain name registrations based on these two tables\n   or ones similar to them,\
    \ a complete understanding of RFC 3743 is\n   needed for the proper use of those\
    \ tables.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document is subject to the same security\
    \ considerations as RFC\n   3743, which defines the table formats and operations.\
    \  As with that\n   base document, part of its intent is to reduce the security\
    \ problems\n   that might be caused by confusion among characters with similar\n\
    \   appearances or meanings.  While it will not introduce any additional\n   security\
    \ issues, additional registration restrictions such as those\n   outlined in Section\
    \ 3 may further reduce potential problems.\n"
