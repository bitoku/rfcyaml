  - "2. Abstract\n   This document describes how intra-LIS IP multicast can be efficiently\n\
    \   supported among routers over ATM without using the Multicast Address\n   Resolution\
    \ Server (MARS). The method described here is specific to\n   Sparse Mode PIM\
    \ [PIM-SM], and relies on the explicit join mechanism\n   inherent in PIM-SM to\
    \ notify routers when they should create group\n   specific point-to-multipoint\
    \ VCs.\n"
- title: 3. Overall model
  contents:
  - "3. Overall model\n   This document focuses on forwarding of multicast traffic\
    \ among PIM-SM\n   routers connected to an ATM network. Routers on an ATM network\
    \ are\n   partitioned into Logical IP Subnets, or LISs.  This document deals\n\
    \   with handling multicast within a single LIS. Handling inter-LIS\n   multicast\
    \ traffic, including handling shortcuts, is outside the scope\n   of this document.\
    \  In addition, this document does not address\n   forwarding of multicast traffic\
    \ to or from hosts connected to an ATM\n   network.\n"
- title: 4. Router behavior
  contents:
  - "4. Router behavior\n   This document requires that each router within a LIS knows\
    \ IP and ATM\n   addresses of all other routers within the LIS. The mapping between\
    \ IP\n   and ATM addresses may be provided by an ARP server [RFC2225], or by\n\
    \   any other means (e.g., static configuration).\n   Each PIM router within a\
    \ LIS is required to maintain a single\n   (shared) point-to-multipoint distribution\
    \ VC rooted at the router\n   with all other PIM routers in the LIS as the leaf\
    \ nodes. The VC is\n   expected to be used for forwarding of multicast traffic\
    \ (both data\n   and control) among routers within the LIS. For example, this\
    \ VC would\n   be used for distributing PIM [PIM-SM] control messages (Join/Prune\n\
    \   messages).\n   In addition, if a PIM router receives a IGMP report from an\
    \ non-PIM\n   neighbor, then the router may add the reporter to the existing shared\n\
    \   distribution VC or to the group specific distribution VC (if it\n   exists).\
    \ The PIM router may also create a specific VC for this IGMP\n   proxy.\n"
- title: 4.1. Establishing Dedicated, Per Group Point-to-Multipoint VCs
  contents:
  - "4.1. Establishing Dedicated, Per Group Point-to-Multipoint VCs\n   Routers may\
    \ also maintain group specific, dedicated point-to-\n   multipoint VCs. In particular,\
    \ an upstream router for a group may\n   choose to become the root of a group\
    \ specific point-to-multipoint VC\n   whose leaves are the downstream routers\
    \ that have directly connected\n   or downstream receivers for the group. While\
    \ the criteria for\n   establishing a group specific point-to-multipoint VC are\
    \ local to a\n   router, issues such as the volume of traffic associated with\
    \ the\n   group and the fanout factor within the LIS should be considered.\n \
    \  Finally, note that a router must minimally support a single shared\n   point-to-multipoint\
    \ VC for distribution of control messages and data\n   (to all group addresses).\n\
    \   A router can choose to establish a dedicated point-to-multipoint VC\n   (or\
    \ add another leaf to an already established dedicated point-to-\n   multipoint\
    \ VC) when it receives a PIM Join or IGMP report messages\n   from another device\
    \ in the same LIS. When a router that is the root\n   of a point-to-multipoint\
    \ VC receives PIM Prune message or IGMP leave,\n   it removes the originator of\
    \ the message from its dedicated point-\n   to-multipoint VC.\n"
- title: 4.2. Switching to a Source-Rooted Tree
  contents:
  - "4.2. Switching to a Source-Rooted Tree\n   If at least one of the routers within\
    \ a LIS decides to switch to a\n   source-rooted tree (by sending (S,G) PIM Joins),\
    \ then all other\n   routers within the LIS that have downstream members for G\
    \ should\n   switch to that source-rooted tree as well. Since a router that\n\
    \   switches to a source-rooted tree sends PIM Join messages for (S,G)\n   over\
    \ its shared point-to-multipoint VC, the other routers within the\n   LIS are\
    \ able to detect this. Once a router that has downstream\n   members for G detects\
    \ this, the router should send (S,G) PIM Join\n   message as well (otherwise the\
    \ router may receive duplicate traffic\n   from S).\n   Note that it is possible\
    \ for a non-PIM router in the LIS to fail to\n   receive data if the injection\
    \ point moves to router to which there is\n   not an existing VC.\n"
- title: 4.2.1. Adding New Members to a Source-Rooted Tree
  contents:
  - "4.2.1. Adding New Members to a Source-Rooted Tree\n   As mentioned above, this\
    \ document requires that once one router in a\n   LIS decides to switch to the\
    \ source tree for some (S,G), all routers\n   in the LIS that have downstream\
    \ members must also switch to the (S,G)\n   source tree. Now, when a new router\
    \ wants to receive traffic from G,\n   it starts sending (*,G)-Joins on it's shared\
    \ point-to-multipoint VC\n   toward the RP for G. The root of the (S,G)-source-rooted\
    \ tree will\n   know to add the new router to the point-to-multipoint VC servicing\n\
    \   the (S,G)-source-rooted tree by observing the (*,G)-joins on it's\n   shared\
    \ point-to-multipoint VC. However, the new router must also\n   switch to the\
    \ (S,G)-source-rooted tree. In order to accomplish this,\n   the newly added router\
    \ must:\n      (i).    Notice that it has been added to a new\n              point-to-multipoint\
    \ VC\n      (ii).   Notice (S,G) traffic coming down this new\n              point-to-multipoint\
    \ VC\n      (iii).  Send (S,G) joins toward S, causing it to switch to the\n \
    \             source-rooted tree. The router learns that the VC is used\n    \
    \          to distribute (S,G) traffic in the previous steps.\n"
- title: 4.3. Handing the "Packet Reflection" Problem
  contents:
  - "4.3. Handing the \"Packet Reflection\" Problem\n   When a router receives a multicast\
    \ packet from another router in its\n   own LIS, the router should not send the\
    \ packet on any of the routers\n   distribution point-to-multipoint VCs associate\
    \ with the LIS. This\n   eliminates the problem of \"packet reflection\". Sending\
    \ the packet on\n   the routers' distribution VCs associated with other LISs is\n\
    \   controlled by the multicast routing procedures.\n"
- title: 5. Brief Comparison with MARS
  contents:
  - "5. Brief Comparison with MARS\n   The intra-LIS multicast scheme described in\
    \ this document is intended\n   to be a less complex solution to an important\
    \ subset of the\n   functionality provided by the Multicast Address Resolution\
    \ Server, or\n   MARS [MARS]. In particular, it is designed to provide intra-LIS\n\
    \   multicast between routers using PIM-SM, and does not consider the\n   case\
    \ of host-rooted point-to-multicast multicast distribution VCs.\n   Although MARS\
    \ supports both of the current schemes for mapping the IP\n   multicast service\
    \ model to ATM (multicast server and meshes of\n   point-to-multipoint VCs), it\
    \ does so at at cost and complexity higher\n   than of the scheme described in\
    \ this document. In addition, MARS\n   requires new encapsulations, whereas this\
    \ proposal works with either\n   LLC/SNAP or with NLPID encapsulation. Another\
    \ important difference is\n   that MARS allows point-to-multipoint VCs rooted\
    \ either at a source or\n   at a multicast server (MCS). The approach taken here\
    \ is to constrain\n   complexity by focusing on PIM-SM (taking advantage of information\n\
    \   available in explicit joins), and by allowing point-to-multipoint VCs\n  \
    \ to be rooted only at the routers (which is roughly analogous to the\n   complexity\
    \ and functionality of rooting point-to-multipoint VCs at\n   the sources).\n\
    \   In summary, the method described in this document is designed for the\n  \
    \ router-to-router case, and takes advantage of the explicit-join\n   mechanism\
    \ inherent in PIM-SM to provide a simple mechanism for\n   intra-LIS multicast\
    \ between routers. MARS, on the other hand, accepts\n   different tradeoffs in\
    \ complexity-functionality design space. In\n   particular, while the MARS paradigm\
    \ provides a general neighbor\n   discovery mechanism, allows host to participate,\
    \ and is protocol\n   independent, it does so at considerable cost.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   In general, the security issues relevant to the\
    \ proposal outlined in\n   the memo are subsumed by those faced by PIM-SM. While\
    \ work in\n   proceeding on security for PIM-SM, it is worthwhile noting that\n\
    \   several issues have been raised in conjunction with multicast routing\n  \
    \ and with PIM-SM in particular. These issues include but are not\n   limited\
    \ to:\n      (i).   Unauthorized Senders\n      (ii).  Unauthorized Receivers\n\
    \      (iii). Unauthorized use of the RP\n      (iv).  Unauthorized \"last hop\"\
    \ switching to shortest path\n             tree.\n"
- title: 6.1. General Comments on Multicast Routing Protocol Security
  contents:
  - "6.1. General Comments on Multicast Routing Protocol Security\n   Historically,\
    \ routing protocols used within the Internet have lacked\n   strong authentication\
    \ mechanisms [RFC1704]. In the late 1980s,\n   analysis revealed that there were\
    \ a number of security problems in\n   Internet routing protocols then in use\
    \ [BELLOVIN89].  During the\n   early 1990s it became clear that adversaries were\
    \ selectively\n   attacking various intra-domain and inter-domain routing protocols\n\
    \   (e.g. via TCP session stealing of BGP sessions) [CERTCA9501,\n   RFC1636].\
    \ More recently, cryptographic authentication mechanisms have\n   been developed\
    \ for RIPv2, OSPF, and the proprietary EIGRP routing\n   protocols.  BGP protection,\
    \ in the form of a Keyed MD5 option for\n   TCP, has also become widely deployed.\n\
    \   At present, most multicast routing protocols lack strong\n   cryptographic\
    \ protection.  One possible approach to this is to\n   incorporate a strong cryptographic\
    \ protection mechanism (e.g. Keyed\n   HMAC MD5 [RFC2104]) within the routing\
    \ protocol itself.  Alternately,\n   the routing protocol could be designed and\
    \ specified to use the IP\n   Authentication Header (AH) [RFC1825, RFC1826, RFC2085]\
    \ to provide\n   cryptographic authentication.\n   Because the intent of any routing\
    \ protocol is to propagate routing\n   information to other parties, confidentiality\
    \ is not generally\n   required in routing protocols.  In those few cases where\
    \ local\n   security policy might require confidentiality, the use of the IP\n\
    \   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC1825, RFC1827] is\n   recommended.\n\
    \   Scalable dynamic multicast key management is an active research area\n   at\
    \ this time. Candidate technologies for scalable dynamic multicast\n   key management\
    \ include CBT-based key management [RFC1949] and the\n   Group Key Management\
    \ Protocol (GKMP) [RFC2093,RFC2094].  The IETF IP\n   Security Working Group is\
    \ actively working on GKMP extensions to the\n   standards-track ISAKMP key management\
    \ protocol being developed in the\n   same working group.\n"
