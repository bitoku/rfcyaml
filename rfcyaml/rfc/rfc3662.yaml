    \ of this Memo\n   This memo provides information for the Internet community.\
    \  It does\n   not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of\
    \ this\n   memo is unlimited.\nCopyright Notice\n   Copyright (C) The Internet\
    \ Society (2003).  All Rights Reserved.\nAbstract\n   This document proposes a\
    \ differentiated services per-domain behavior\n   (PDB) whose traffic may be \"\
    starved\" (although starvation is not\n   strictly required) in a properly functioning\
    \ network.  This is in\n   contrast to the Internet's \"best-effort\" or \"normal\
    \ Internet traffic\"\n   model, where prolonged starvation indicates network problems.\
    \  In\n   this sense, the proposed PDB's traffic is forwarded with a \"lower\"\
    \n   priority than the normal \"best-effort\" Internet traffic, thus the PDB\n\
    \   is called \"Lower Effort\" (LE).  Use of this PDB permits a network\n   operator\
    \ to strictly limit the effect of its traffic on \"best-\n   effort\"/\"normal\"\
    \ or all other Internet traffic.  This document gives\n   some example uses, but\
    \ does not propose constraining the PDB's use to\n   any particular type of traffic.\n\
    1.  Description of the Lower Effort PDB\n   This document proposes a differentiated\
    \ services per-domain behavior\n   [RFC3086] called \"Lower Effort\" (LE) which\
    \ is intended for traffic of\n   sufficiently low value (where \"value\" may be\
    \ interpreted in any\n   useful way by the network operator), in which all other\
    \ traffic takes\n   precedence over LE traffic in consumption of network link\
    \ bandwidth.\n   One possible interpretation of \"low value\" traffic is its low\n\
    \   priority in time, which does not necessarily imply that it is\n   generally\
    \ of minor importance.  From this viewpoint, it can be\n   considered as a network\
    \ equivalent to a background priority for\n   processes in an operating system.\
    \  There may or may not be memory\n   (buffer) resources allocated for this type\
    \ of traffic.\n   Some networks carry traffic for which delivery is considered\n\
    \   optional; that is, packets of this type of traffic ought to consume\n   network\
    \ resources only when no other traffic is present.\n   Alternatively, the effect\
    \ of this type of traffic on all other\n   network traffic is strictly limited.\
    \  This is distinct from \"best-\n   effort\" (BE) traffic since the network makes\
    \ no commitment to deliver\n   LE packets.  In contrast, BE traffic receives an\
    \ implied \"good faith\"\n   commitment of at least some available network resources.\
    \  This\n   document proposes a Lower Effort Differentiated Services per-domain\n\
    \   behavior (LE PDB) [RFC3086] for handling this \"optional\" traffic in a\n\
    \   differentiated services domain.\n   There is no intrinsic reason to limit\
    \ the applicability of the LE PDB\n   to any particular application or type of\
    \ traffic.  It is intended as\n   an additional tool for administrators in engineering\
    \ networks.\n   Note: where not otherwise defined, terminology used in this document\n\
    \   is defined as in [RFC2474].\n2.  Applicability\n   A Lower Effort (LE) PDB\
    \ is for sending extremely non-critical traffic\n   across a DS domain or DS region.\
    \  There should be an expectation that\n   packets of the LE PDB may be delayed\
    \ or dropped when other traffic is\n   present.  Use of the LE PDB might assist\
    \ a network operator in moving\n   certain kinds of traffic or users to off-peak\
    \ times.  Alternatively,\n   or in addition, packets can be designated for the\
    \ LE PDB when the\n   goal is to protect all other packet traffic from competition\
    \ with the\n   LE aggregate, while not completely banning LE traffic from the\n\
    \   network.  An LE PDB should not be used for a customer's \"normal\n   internet\"\
    \ traffic, nor should packets be \"downgraded\" to the LE PDB\n   for use as a\
    \ substitute for dropping packets that ought to simply be\n   dropped as unauthorized.\
    \  The LE PDB is expected to be applicable to\n   networks that have some unused\
    \ capacity at some times of day.\n   This is a PDB that allows networks to protect\
    \ themselves from\n   selected types of traffic rather than giving a selected\
    \ traffic\n   aggregate preferential treatment.  Moreover, it may also exploit\
    \ all\n   unused resources from other PDBs.\n3.  Technical Specification\n3.1.\
    \  Classification and Traffic Conditioning\n   There are no required traffic profiles\
    \ governing the rate and bursts\n   of packets beyond the limits imposed by the\
    \ ingress link.  It is not\n   necessary to limit the LE aggregate using edge\
    \ techniques since its\n   PHB is configured such that packets of the aggregate\
    \ will be dropped\n   in the network if no forwarding resources are available.\
    \  The\n   differentiated services architecture [RFC2475] allows packets to be\n\
    \   marked upstream of the DS domain or at the DS domain's edge.  When\n   packets\
    \ arrive pre-marked with the DSCP used by the LE PDB, it should\n   not be necessary\
    \ for the DS domain boundary to police that marking;\n   further (MF) classification\
    \ for such packets would only be required\n   if there was some reason for the\
    \ packets to be marked with a\n   different DSCP.\n   If there is not an agreement\
    \ on a DSCP marking with the upstream\n   domain for a DS domain using the LE\
    \ PDB, the boundary must include a\n   classifier that selects the appropriate\
    \ LE target group of packets\n   out of all arriving packets and steers them to\
    \ a marker that sets the\n   appropriate DSCP.  No other traffic conditioning\
    \ is required.\n3.2.  PHB configuration\n   Either a Class Selector (CS) PHB [RFC2474],\
    \ an Experimental/Local Use\n   (EXP/LU) PHB [RFC2474], or an Assured Forwarding\
    \ (AF) PHB [RFC2597]\n   may be used as the PHB for the LE traffic aggregate.\
    \  This document\n   does not specify the exact DSCP to use inside a domain, but\
    \ instead\n   specifies the necessary properties of the PHB selected by the DSCP.\n\
    \   If a CS PHB is used, Class Selector 1 (DSCP=001000) is suggested.\n   The\
    \ PHB used by the LE aggregate inside a DS domain should be\n   configured so\
    \ that its packets are forwarded onto the node output\n   link when the link would\
    \ otherwise be idle; conceptually, this is the\n   behavior of a weighted round-robin\
    \ scheduler with a weight of zero.\n   An operator might choose to configure a\
    \ very small link share for the\n   LE aggregate and still achieve the desired\
    \ goals.  That is, if the\n   output link scheduler permits, a small fixed rate\
    \ might be assigned\n   to the PHB, but the behavior beyond that configured rate\
    \ should be\n   that packets are forwarded only when the link would otherwise\
    \ be\n   idle.  This behavior could be obtained, for example, by using a CBQ\n\
    \   [CBQ] scheduler with a small share and with borrowing permitted.  A\n   PHB\
    \ that allows packets of the LE aggregate to send more than the\n   configured\
    \ rate when packets of other traffic aggregates are waiting\n   for the link is\
    \ not recommended.\n   If a CS PHB is used, note that this configuration will\
    \ violate the\n   \"SHOULD\" of section 4.2.2.2 of RFC 2474 [RFC2474] since CS1\
    \ will have\n   a less timely forwarding than CS0.  An operator's goal of providing\n\
    \   an LE PDB is sufficient cause for violating the SHOULD.  If an AF PHB\n  \
    \ is used, it must be configured and a DSCP assigned such that it does\n   not\
    \ violate the \"MUST\" of paragraph three of section 2 of RFC 2597\n   [RFC2597]\
    \ which provides for a \"minimum amount of forwarding\n   resources\".\n4.  Attributes\n\
    \   The ingress and egress flow of the LE aggregate can be measured but\n   there\
    \ are no absolute or statistical attributes that arise from the\n   PDB definition.\
    \  A particular network operator may configure the DS\n   domain in such a way\
    \ that a statistical metric can be associated with\n   that DS domain.  When the\
    \ DS domain is known to be heavily congested\n   with traffic of other PDBs, a\
    \ network operator should expect to see\n   no (or very few) packets of the LE\
    \ PDB egress from the domain.  When\n   there is no other traffic present, the\
    \ proportion of the LE aggregate\n   that successfully crosses the domain should\
    \ be limited only by the\n   capacity of the network relative to the ingress LE\
    \ traffic aggregate.\n5.  Parameters\n   None required.\n6.  Assumptions\n   A\
    \ properly functioning network.\n7.  Example uses\n   o  Multimedia applications\
    \ [this example edited from Yoram Bernet]:\n      Many network managers want to\
    \ protect their networks from certain\n      applications, in particular, from\
    \ multimedia applications that\n      typically use such non-adaptive protocols\
    \ as UDP.\n      Most of the focus in quality-of-service is on achieving attributes\n\
    \      that are better than Best Effort.  These approaches can provide\n     \
    \ network managers with the ability to control the amount of\n      multimedia\
    \ traffic that is given this improved performance with\n      excess relegated\
    \ to Best Effort.  This excess traffic can wreak\n      havoc with network resources\
    \ even when it is relegated to Best\n      Effort because it is non-adaptive and\
    \ because it can be\n      significant in volume and duration.  These characteristics\
    \ permit\n      it to seize network resources, thereby compromising the\n    \
    \  performance of other, more important applications that are\n      included\
    \ in the Best Effort traffic aggregate but that use\n      adaptive protocols\
    \ (e.g., TCP).  As a result, network managers\n      often simply refuse to allow\
    \ multimedia applications to be\n      deployed in resource constrained parts\
    \ of their network.\n      The LE PDB enables a network manager to allow the deployment\
    \ of\n      multimedia applications without losing control of network\n      resources.\
    \  A limited amount of multimedia traffic may (or may\n      not) be assigned\
    \ to PDBs with attributes that are better than Best\n      Effort.  Excess multimedia\
    \ traffic can be prevented from wreaking\n      havoc with network resources by\
    \ forcing it to the LE PDB.\n   o  For Netnews and other \"bulk mail\" of the\
    \ Internet.\n   o  For \"downgraded\" traffic from some other PDB when this does\
    \ not\n      violate the operational objectives of the other PDB or the overall\n\
    \      network.  As noted in section 2, LE should not be used for the\n      general\
    \ case of downgraded traffic, but may be used by design,\n      e.g., when multicast\
    \ is used with a value-added DS-service and\n      consequently the Neglected\
    \ Reservation Subtree problem [NRS]\n      arises.\n   o  For content distribution,\
    \ peer-to-peer file sharing traffic, and\n      the like.\n   o  For traffic caused\
    \ by world-wide web search engines while they\n      gather information from web\
    \ servers.\n8.  Experiences\n   The authors solicit further experiences for this\
    \ section.  Results\n   from simulations are presented and discussed in Appendix\
    \ A.\n9.  Security Considerations for LE PDB\n   There are no specific security\
    \ exposures for this PDB.  See the\n   general security considerations in [RFC2474]\
    \ and [RFC2475].\n10.  History of the LE PDB\n   The previous name of this PDB,\
    \ \"bulk handling\", was loosely based on\n   the United States' Postal Service\
    \ term for very low priority mail,\n   sent at a reduced rate: it denotes a lower-cost\
    \ delivery where the\n   items are not handled with the same care or delivered\
    \ with the same\n   timeliness as items with first-class postage.  Finally, the\
    \ name was\n   changed to \"lower effort\", because the authors and other DiffServ\n\
    \   Working Group members believe that the name should be more generic in\n  \
    \ order to not imply constraints on the PDB's use to a particular type\n   of\
    \ traffic (namely that of bulk data).\n   The notion of having something \"lower\
    \ than Best Effort\" was raised in\n   the Diffserv Working Group, most notably\
    \ by Roland Bless and Klaus\n   Wehrle in their Internet Drafts [LBE] and [LE]\
    \ and by Yoram Bernet\n   for enterprise multimedia applications.  One of its\
    \ first\n   applications was to re-mark packets within multicast groups [NRS].\n\
    \   Therefore, previous discussions centered on the creation of a new\n   PHB.\
    \  However, the original authors (Brian Carpenter and Kathleen\n   Nichols) believe\
    \ this is not required and this document was written\n   to specifically explain\
    \ how to get less than Best Effort without a\n   new PHB.\n11.  Acknowledgments\n\
    \   Yoram Bernet contributed significant amounts of text for the\n   \"Examples\"\
    \ section of this document and provided other useful\n   comments that helped\
    \ in editing.  Other Diffserv WG members suggested\n   that the LE PDB is needed\
    \ for Napster traffic, particularly at\n   universities.  Special thanks go to\
    \ Milena Neumann for her extensive\n   efforts in performing the simulations that\
    \ are described in Appendix\n   A.\nAppendix A.  Experiences from a Simulation\
    \ Model\n   The intention of this appendix is to show that a Lower Effort PDB\n\
    \   with a behavior as described in this document can be realized with\n   different\
    \ implementations and PHBs respectively.  Overall, each of\n   these variants\
    \ show the desired behavior but also show minor\n   differences in certain traffic\
    \ load situations.  This comparison\n   could make the choice of a realization\
    \ variant interesting for a\n   network operator.\nA.1.  Simulation Environment\n\
    \   The small DiffServ domain shown in Figure 1 was used to simulate the\n   LE\
    \ PDB.  There are three main sources of traffic (S1-S3) depicted on\n   the left\
    \ side of the figure.  Source S1 sends five aggregated TCP\n   flows (A1-A5) to\
    \ the receivers R1-R5 respectively.  Each aggregated\n   flow Ax consists of 20\
    \ TCP connections, where each aggregate\n   experiences a different round trip\
    \ time between 10ms and 250ms.\n   There are two sources of bulk traffic.  B1\
    \ consists of 100 TCP\n   connections sending as much data as possible to R6 and\
    \ B2 is a single\n   UDP flow also sending as much as possible to R7.\n      \

    \                  R7\n            Figure 1: A DiffServ domain with different\
    \ flows\n   In order to show the benefit of using the LE PDB instead of the\n\
    \   normal Best Effort (BE) PDB [RFC3086], different scenarios are used:\n   A)\
    \ B1 and B2 are not present, i.e., the \"normal\" situation without\n      bulk\
    \ data present.  A1-A5 use the BE PDB.\n   B) B1 and B2 use the BE PDB for their\
    \ traffic, too.\n   C) B1 and B2 use LE PDB for their traffic with different PHB\n\
    \      implementations:\n         1) PHB with Priority Queueing (PQ)\n       \
    \  2) PHB with Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ)\n         3) PHB with Weighted RED\
    \ (WRED)\n         4) PHB with WFQ and RED\n   C1) represents the case where there\
    \ are no allocated resources for\n   the LE PDB, i.e., LE traffic is only forwarded\
    \ if there are unused\n   resources.  In scenarios C2)-C4), a bandwidth share\
    \ of 10% has been\n   allocated for the LE PDB.  RED parameters were set to w_q=0.1\
    \ and\n   max_p=0.2.  In scenario C2), two tail drop queues were used for BE\n\
    \   and LE and WFQ scheduling was set up with a weight of 9:1 for the\n   ratio\
    \ of BE:LE.  In scenario C3), a total queue length of 200000\n   bytes was used\
    \ with the following thresholds: min_th_BE=19000,\n   max_th_BE=63333, min_th_LE=2346,\
    \ max_th=7037.  WRED allows to mark\n   packets with BE or LE within the same\
    \ microflow (e.g., letting\n   applications pre-mark packets according to their\
    \ importance) without\n   causing a reordering of packets within the microflow.\
    \  In scenario\n   C4), each queue had a length of 50000 bytes with the same thresholds\n\
    \   of min_th=18000 and max_th=48000 bytes.  WFQ parameters were the same\n  \
    \ as in C2).\n   The link bandwidth between IR1 and IR2 is limited to 1200 kbit/s,\n\
    \   thus creating the bottleneck in the network for the following\n   situations.\
    \  In all situations, the 20 TCP connections within each\n   aggregated flow Ax\
    \ (flowing from S1 to Rx) used the Best Effort PDB.\n   Sender S2 transmitted\
    \ bulk flow B1 (consisting of 100 TCP connections\n   to R6) with an aggregated\
    \ rate of 550 kbit/s, whereas the UDP sender\n   S3 transmitted with a rate of\
    \ 50 kbit/s.\n   The following four different situations with varying traffic\
    \ load for\n   the Ax flows (at application level) were simulated.\n      Situation\

    \   In situation I, there are no unused resources left for the B1 and B2\n   flows.\
    \  In situation II, there is a residual bandwidth of 10% of the\n   bottleneck\
    \ link between IR1 and IR2.  In situation III, the traffic\n   load of A1-A5 is\
    \ 50% higher than the bottleneck link capacity.  In\n   situation IV, A1-A5 consume\
    \ only 2/3 of the bottleneck link capacity.\n   B1 and B2 require together 50%\
    \ of the bottleneck link capacity.\n   The simulations were performed with the\
    \ freely available discrete\n   event simulation tool OMNeT++ and a suitable set\
    \ of QoS mechanisms\n   [SimKIDS].  Results from the different simulation scenarios\
    \ are\n   discussed in the next section.\nA.2.  Simulation Results\n   QoS parameters\
    \ listed in the following tables are averaged over the\n   first 160s of the transmission.\
    \  Results of situation I are shown in\n   Figure 2.  When the BE PDB is used\
    \ for transmission of bulk flows B1\n   and B2 in case B), one can see that flows\
    \ A1-A5 throttle their\n   sending rate to allow transmission of bulk flows B1\
    \ and B2.  In case\n   C1), not a single packet is transmitted to the receiver\
    \ because all\n   packets get dropped within IR1, thereby protecting Ax flows\
    \ from Bx\n   flows.  In case C2), B1 and B2 consume all resources up to the\n\
    \   configured limit of 10% of the link bandwidth, but not more.  C3)\n   also\
    \ limits the share of B1 and B2 flows, but not as precisely as\n   with WFQ. \
    \ C4) shows slightly higher packet losses for Ax flows due\n   to the active queue\
    \ management.\n+-------------------------+--------+-----------------------------------+\n\

    \        Figure 5: Situation IV - Best Effort traffic load is 67%\n   In summary,\
    \ all the different scenarios show that the \"normal\" BE\n   traffic can be protected\
    \ from traffic in the LE PDB effectively.\n   Either no packets get through if\
    \ no residual bandwidth is left (LE\n   traffic is starved), or traffic of the\
    \ LE PDB can only consume\n   resources up to a configurable limit.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ the results substantiate that mass data transfer can\n   adversely affect \"\
    normal\" BE traffic (e.g., 14.9% packet loss in\n   situations I and II, even\
    \ 10.2% in situation IV) in situations\n   without using the LE PDB.\n   Thus,\
    \ while all presented variants of realizing the LE PDB meet the\n   desired behavior\
    \ of protecting BE traffic, they also show small\n   differences in detail.  A\
    \ network operator has the opportunity to\n   choose a realization method to fit\
    \ the desired behavior (showing this\n   is - after the proof of LE's efficacy\
    \ - the second designation of\n   this appendix).  For instance, if operators\
    \ want to starve LE traffic\n   completely in times of congestion, they could\
    \ choose PQ.  This causes\n   LE traffic to be completely starved and not a single\
    \ packet would get\n   through in case of full load or overload.\n   On the other\
    \ hand, for network operators who want to permit some\n   small amount of throughput\
    \ in the LE PDB, one of the other variants\n   would be a better choice.\n   Referring\
    \ to this, the WFQ implementation showed a slightly more\n   robust behavior with\
    \ PQ, but had problems with synchronized TCP\n   flows.  WRED behavior is highly\
    \ dependent on the actual traffic\n   characteristics and packet loss rates are\
    \ often higher compared to\n   other implementations, while the fairness between\
    \ TCP connections is\n   better.  The combined solution of WFQ with RED showed\
    \ the overall\n   best behavior, when an operator's intent is to keep a small\
    \ but\n   noticeable throughput in the LE PDB.\nNormative References\n   [RFC3086]\
