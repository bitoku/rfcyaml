  - "1. Overview\n   The General Switch Management Protocol (GSMP) has been available\
    \ to\n   the IETF community for several years now as informational RFCs.  Both\n\
    \   GSMPv1.1 (released in March 1996 as RFC 1987 [2]) and GSMPv2.0\n   (released\
    \ in August 1998 as RFC 2297 [3]) are available.  Several\n   vendors have implemented\
    \ GSMPv1.1.\n   In V1.1 and V2 GSMP was intended only for use with ATM switches.\n\
    \   During the course of the last two years, the GSMP working group has\n   decided\
    \ to expand the purview of GSMP to the point where it can be\n   used to control\
    \ a number of different kinds of switch and can thus\n   live up to what its name\
    \ indicates; a general switch management\n   protocol.  To do this, commands and\
    \ arguments needed to be\n   generalised and sections needed to be added, discussing\
    \ the manner in\n   which the generalised protocol could be applied to specific\
    \ kinds of\n   switches and port types.  In short, the protocol has gone through\n\
    \   major changes in the last 24 months.\n   GSMP provides an interface that can\
    \ be used to separate the data\n   forwarder from the routing and other control\
    \ plane protocols such as\n   LDP.  As such it allows service providers to move\
    \ away from\n   monolithic systems that bundle the control plane and the data\
    \ plane\n   into a single tightly coupled system - usually in a single chassis.\n\
    \   Separating the control components from the forwarding components and\n   using\
    \ GSMP for switch management, enables service providers to create\n   multi-service\
    \ systems composed of various vendors equipment.  It also\n   allows for a more\
    \ dynamic means of adding services to their networks.\n   The IETF GSMP working\
    \ group was established in the routing area\n   because GSMP was being seen as\
    \ an optional part of the MPLS solution.\n   In a MPLS system, it is possible\
    \ to run the routing protocols and\n   label distribution protocols on one system\
    \ while passing data across\n   a generic switch, e.g., an ATM switch.  GSMP provides\
    \ the switch\n   resource management mechanism needed in such a scenario.\n  \
    \ GSMP has also been selected by the Multiservice Switching Forum (MSF)\n   as\
    \ its protocol of choice for the Switch Control Interface identified\n   in their\
    \ architecture.  The MSF is an industry forum which, among its\n   activities\
    \ establishes their member's requirements and then works\n   with the appropriate\
    \ standards bodies to foster their goals.  In the\n   case of GSMP, the MSF presented\
    \ the IETF GSMP Working Group with a\n   set of requirements for GSMP.  The working\
    \ group has made a\n   determined effort to comply with those requirements in\
    \ its\n   specifications.\n"

- title: 3. General Description
  contents:
  - "3. General Description\n   The General Switch Management Protocol V3 (GSMPv3)\
    \ [5], is a general\n      purpose protocol to control a label switch.  GSMP allows\
    \ a\n      controller to establish and release connections across the switch;\n\
    \      add and delete leaves on a multicast connection; reserve\n      resources;\
    \ manage switch ports; request configuration information;\n      and request statistics.\
    \  It also allows the switch to inform the\n      controller of asynchronous events\
    \ such as a link going down.  The\n      GSMPv3 protocol is asymmetric, the controller\
    \ being the master and\n      the switch being the slave.\n   A physical switch\
    \ can be partitioned into many virtual switches.\n      GSMPv3 does not provide\
    \ support for defining switch partitions.\n      GSMPv3 treats a virtual switch\
    \ as if it were a physical switch.\n   GSMPv3 may be transported in three ways:\n\
    \      -  GSMPv3 operation across an IP network is specified.\n      -  GSMPv3\
    \ operation across an ATM virtual channel is specified.\n      -  GSMPv3 operation\
    \ across an Ethernet link is specified.\n   Other encapsulations are possible,\
    \ but have not been defined.\n   Encapsulations are defined in [4].\n   A label\
    \ switch is a frame or cell switch that supports connection\n      oriented switching\
    \ using the exact match forwarding algorithm\n      based on labels attached to\
    \ incoming cells or frames.\n   A label switch may support multiple label types.\
    \  However, each\n      switch port can support only one label type.  The label\
    \ type\n      supported by a given port is indicated in a port configuration\n\
    \      message.  Connections may be established between ports supporting\n   \
    \   different label types using the adaptation methods.  GSMPv3\n      supports\
    \ TLV labels similar to those defined in MPLS.  Examples of\n      labels which\
    \ are defined include ATM, Frame Relay, DS1, DS3, E1,\n      E3, MPLS Generic\
    \ Labels and MPLS FECs.\n   A connection across a switch is formed by connecting\
    \ an incoming\n      labelled channel to one or more outgoing labelled channels.\n\
    \      Connections are generally referenced by the input port on which\n     \
    \ they arrive and the label values of their incoming labelled\n      channel.\
    \  In some messages, connections are referenced by the\n      output port.\n \
    \  GSMPv3 supports point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections.\n     \
    \ A multipoint-to-point connection is specified by establishing\n      multiple\
    \ point-to-point connections, each of which specifies the\n      same output label.\
    \  A multipoint-to-multipoint connection is\n      specified by establishing multiple\
    \ point-to-multipoint connections\n      each of which specifies a different input\
    \ label with the same\n      output labels.\n   In general a connection is established\
    \ with a certain quality of\n      service (QoS).  GSMPv3 includes a default QoS\
    \ Configuration and\n      additionally allows the negotiation of alternative,\
    \ optional QoS\n      configurations.  The default QoS Configuration includes\
    \ three QoS\n      Models: a default service model, a simple priority model and\
    \ a QoS\n      profile model.  GSMPv3 also supports the reservation of resources\n\
    \      when the labels are not yet known.  This ability can be used in\n     \
    \ support of MPLS.\n   GSMP contains an adjacency protocol.  The adjacency protocol\
    \ is used\n      to synchronise states across the link, to negotiate which version\n\
    \      of the GSMP protocol to use, to discover the identity of the\n      entity\
    \ at the other end of a link, and to detect when it changes.\n"
- title: 3.1 Switch Partitioning
  contents:
  - "3.1 Switch Partitioning\n   In GSMPv3 switch partitioning is static and occurs\
    \ prior to running\n   the protocol.  The partitions of a physical switch are\
    \ isolated from\n   each other by the implementation and the controller assumes\
    \ that the\n   resources allocated to a partition are at all times available to\
    \ that\n   partition and only that partition.  A partition appears to its\n  \
    \ controller as a physical label switch.  The resources allocated to a\n   partition\
    \ appear to the controller as if they were the actual\n   physical resources of\
    \ a physical switch.  For example if the\n   bandwidth of a port is divided among\
    \ several partitions, each\n   partition would appear to the controller to have\
    \ its own independent\n   port with its fixed set of resources.\n   GSMPv3 controls\
    \ a partitioned switch through the use of a partition\n   identifier that is carried\
    \ in every GSMPv3 message.  Each partition\n   has a one-to-one control relationship\
    \ with its own logical controller\n   entity (which in the remainder of the document\
    \ is referred to simply\n   as a controller) and GSMPv3 independently maintains\
    \ adjacency between\n   each controller-partition pair.\n"
- title: 3.2 Switch and controller interactions
  contents:
  - "3.2 Switch and controller interactions\n   Multiple switches may be controlled\
    \ by a single controller using\n   multiple instantiations of the protocol over\
    \ separate control\n   connections.\n   Alternatively, multiple controllers can\
    \ control a single switch.\n   Each controller would establish a control connection\
    \ to the switch\n   using the adjacency protocol.  The adjacency mechanism maintains\
    \ a\n   state table indicating the control connections that are being\n   maintained\
    \ by the same partition.  The switch provides information to\n   the controller\
    \ group about the number and identity of the attached\n   controllers.  It does\
    \ nothing, however, to co-ordinate the activities\n   of the controllers, and\
    \ will execute all commands as they are\n   received.  It is the controller group's\
    \ responsibility to co-ordinate\n   its use of the switch.  This mechanism is\
    \ most commonly used for\n   controller redundancy and load sharing.  Definition\
    \ of the mechanism\n   by which controllers use to co-ordinate their control is\
    \ not within\n   GSMPv3's scope.\n"
- title: 3.3 Service support
  contents:
  - "3.3 Service support\n   All GSMPv3 switches support the default QoS Configuration.\
    \  A GSMPv3\n   switch may additionally support one or more alternative QoS\n\
    \   Configurations.  GSMP includes a negotiation mechanism that allows a\n   controller\
    \ to select from the QoS configurations that a switch\n   supports.\n   The default\
    \ QoS Configuration includes three models:\n      The Service Model is based on\
    \ service definitions found external\n         to GSMP such as in CR-LDP, Integrated\
    \ Services or ATM Service\n         Categories.  Each connection is assigned a\
    \ specific service\n         that defines the handling of the connection by the\
    \ switch.\n         Additionally, traffic parameters and traffic controls may\
    \ be\n         assigned to the connection depending on the assigned service.\n\
    \      In the Simple Abstract Model a connection is assigned a priority\n    \
    \     when it is established.  It may be assumed that for connections\n      \
    \   that share the same output port, a cell or frame on a\n         connection\
    \ with a higher priority is much more likely to exit\n         the switch before\
    \ a cell or frame on a connection with a lower\n         priority if they are\
    \ both in the switch at the same time.\n      The QoS Profile Model provides a\
    \ simple mechanism that allows QoS\n         semantics defined externally to GSMP\
    \ to be assigned to\n         connections.  Each profile is an opaque indicator\
    \ that has been\n         predefined in the controller and in the switch.\n"
- title: 4. Summary of Message Set
  contents:
  - "4. Summary of Message Set\n   The following table gives a summary of the messages\
    \ defined in this\n   version of the specification.  It also makes a recommendation\
    \ of the\n   minimal set of messages that should be supported in an MPLS\n   environment.\
    \  These messages will be labelled as \"Required\", though\n   the service provided\
    \ by the other messages are essential for the\n   operation of carrier quality\
    \ controller/switch operations.  GSMPv1.1\n   or GSMPv2 commands that are no longer\
    \ support are marked as\n   \"Obsolete\" and should no longer be used.\n"
