Abstract This document updates the IANA registries in RFC 4255, which defines SSHFP, a DNS Resource Record (RR) that contains a standard Secure Shell (SSH) key fingerprint used to verify SSH host keys using DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).
This document defines additional options supporting SSH public keys applying the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and the implementation of fingerprints computed using the SHA 256 message digest algorithm in SSHFP Resource Records.
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the global, hierarchical distributed database for Internet naming.
The Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network.
[RFC4253] defines Public Key Algorithms for the Secure Shell server public keys.
The DNS has been extended to store fingerprints in a DNS Resource Record named SSHFP [RFC4255], which provides out of band verification by looking up a fingerprint of the server public key in the DNS [RFC1034][RFC1035] and using Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
[RFC4033][RFC4034][RFC4035] to verify the lookup.
[RFC4255] describes how to store the cryptographic fingerprint of SSH public keys in SSHFP Resource Records.
SSHFP Resource Records contain the fingerprint and two index numbers identifying the cryptographic algorithms used:
1.  to link the fingerprinted public key with the corresponding private key, and 2.
to derive the message digest stored as the fingerprint in the record.
[RFC4255] then specifies lists of cryptographic algorithms and the corresponding index numbers used to identify them in SSHFP Resource Records.
This document updates the IANA registry "SSHFP RR Types for public key algorithms" and "SSHFP RR types for fingerprint types" [SSHFPVALS] by adding a new option in each list:  the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
[RFC6090], which has been added to the Secure Shell Public Key list by RFC 5656
[RFC5656] in the public key algorithms list, and
the SHA 256 algorithm [FIPS.180 3.2008] in the SSHFP fingerprint type list.
Familiarity with DNSSEC, SSH Protocol [RFC4251][RFC4253][RFC4250], SSHFP [RFC4255], and the SHA 2 [FIPS.180 3.2008] family of algorithms is assumed in this document.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
The format of the SSHFP RR can be found in RFC 4255 [RFC4255].
The fingerprint type octet identifies the message digest algorithm used to calculate the fingerprint of the public key.
SHA 256 SSHFP Fingerprint Type Specification SHA 256 fingerprints of the public keys are stored in SSHFP Resource Records with the fingerprint type 2.
The SSHFP Resource Record algorithm number octet describes the algorithm of the public key.
ECDSA SSHFP Algorithm Number Specification ECDSA public keys are stored in SSHFP Resource Records with the algorithm number 3.
Support for SHA 256 Fingerprints SSHFP aware Secure Shell implementations SHOULD support the SHA 256 fingerprints for verification of the public key.
Secure Shell implementations that support SHA 256 fingerprints MUST prefer a SHA  256 fingerprint over SHA 1 if both are available for a server.
If the SHA 256 fingerprint is tested and does not match the SSH public key received from the SSH server, then the key MUST be rejected rather than testing the alternative SHA 1 fingerprint.
Support for ECDSA SSHFP aware Secure Shell implementations that also implement the ECDSA for the public key SHOULD support SSHFP fingerprints for ECDSA public keys.
The following examples provide reference for both the newly defined value for ECDSA and the use of the SHA 256 fingerprint combined with both the new and the existing algorithm numbers.
RSA Public Key A public key with the following value in OpenSSH format [RFC4716] would appear as follows:
RSA Public Key with SHA1 Fingerprint
The SSHFP Resource Record for this key would be: server.example.net IN SSHFP 1 1
RSA Public Key with SHA 256 Fingerprint
The SSHFP Resource Record for this key would be: server.example.net IN SSHFP 1 2 ( b049f950d1397b8fee6a61e4d14a9a cdc4721e084eff5460bbed80cfaa2c e2cb ) 5.2.
DSA Public Key A public key with the following value in OpenSSH format would appear as follows:
DSA Public Key with SHA1 Fingerprint
The SSHFP Resource Record for this key would be: server.example.net IN SSHFP 2 1 ( 3b6ba6110f5ffcd29469fc1ec2ee25 d61718badd )
DSA Public Key with SHA 256 Fingerprint
The SSHFP Resource Record for this key would be: server.example.net IN SSHFP 2 2 ( f9b8a6a460639306f1b38910456a6a
A public key with the following value in OpenSSH format would appear as follows:
ECDSA Public Key with SHA1 Fingerprint
The SSHFP Resource Record for this key would be: server.example.net IN SSHFP 3 1
( c64607a28c5300fec1180b6e417b92 2943cffcdd ) 5.3.2.
ECDSA Public Key with SHA 256 Fingerprint
The SSHFP Resource Record for this key would be: server.example.net IN SSHFP 3 2 ( 821eb6c1c98d9cc827ab7f456304c0 f14785b7008d9e8646a8519de80849 afc7 )

Security Considerations Please see the security considerations in [RFC4255] for SSHFP Resource Records and [RFC5656] for the ECDSA.
Users of SSHFP are encouraged to deploy SHA 256 as soon as implementations allow for it.
The SHA 2 family of algorithms is widely believed to be more resilient to attack than SHA 1, and confidence in SHA 1's strength is being eroded by recently announced attacks [IACR2007/474].
Regardless of whether or not the attacks on SHA 1 will affect SSHFP, it is believed (at the time of this writing) that SHA 256 is the better choice for use in SSHFP records.
SHA 256 is considered sufficiently strong for the immediate future, but predictions about future development in cryptography and cryptanalysis are beyond the scope of this document.
