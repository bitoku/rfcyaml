- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method\
    \ of\n   encapsulating multiple protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.\n\
    \   The PPP Compression Control Protocol [2] provides a method for\n   negotiating\
    \ data compression over PPP links.\n   The Magnalink Variable Resource Compression\
    \ Algorithm (MVRCA) allows\n   a wide range of interoperable compression implementations\
    \ whose\n   performance characteristics are a function of available CPU and\n\
    \   memory resources.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The Magnalink variable resource compression algorithm defines\
    \ a\n   family of interoperable compression solutions with compression\n   performance\
    \ as a function of available CPU and memory resources.  It\n   addresses the need\
    \ for an algorithm which can be tailored to the\n   system on which it is implemented\
    \ without compromising\n   interoperability.\n"

- title: MVRCA Packets
  contents:
  - "MVRCA Packets\n   Before any MVRCA packets may be communicated, PPP must reach\
    \ the\n   Network-Layer Protocol phase[1], and the Compression Control Protocol\n\
    \   must reach the Opened state.\n   The text of a Packet to be compressed begins\
    \ with PPP Protocol\n   number.  The Packet header including the PPP Protocol\
    \ number may have\n   already been compressed when Protocol-Field-Compression\
    \ has been\n   negotiated.\n"
- title: Reliability and Sequencing
  contents:
  - "Reliability and Sequencing\n   MVRCA packets may be sent across an unreliable\
    \ link or may use a\n   reliable link as described in \"PPP Reliable Transmission\"\
    [3] if the\n   reliable link has been negotiated. If frames are delivered out\
    \ of\n   order or a frame is dropped, the decompressor will detect this and\n\
    \   requests a resynchronization using the Reset-Req and Reset-Ack types\n   of\
    \ the CCP[2], with the compressor for the affected context.\n"
- title: Data Expansion
  contents:
  - "Data Expansion\n   Although the compression algorithm may occasionally expand\
    \ a data\n   packet, there is no expansion in MVRCA since any expanded data is\n\
    \   instead sent uncompressed. Dictionary synchronization is maintained\n   across\
    \ uncompressed packets.\n"
- title: Encapsulation
  contents:
  - "Encapsulation\n   The encapsulation consists of the PPP Protocol Identifier,\
    \ a bit to\n   indicate if the data is compressed, the Context Identifier(CID),\
    \ a\n   proprietary flag bit (E), a Packet Integrity Byte(PIB), and the\n   Compressed\
    \ data.\n       0                   1\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5\n\

- title: Compressed/Uncompressed Flag (C)
  contents:
  - "Compressed/Uncompressed Flag (C)\n   When attempting to compress certain types\
    \ of Packets or Fragments the\n   compressor may not be effective. When this occurs\
    \ the uncompressed\n   data is added to the compression History Buffer and sent\
    \ across the\n   link in frame with the Compressed/Uncompressed Flag(C) set to\
    \ 0.\n"
- title: Context Identifier (CID)
  contents:
  - "Context Identifier (CID)\n   Since PPP will transport multiple protocol datagrams\
    \ it may be\n   advantageous to compress each protocol or each virtual circuit\
    \ in a\n   different History Buffer or Context. The CID allows the compressor\
    \ to\n   indicate to the decompressor which History Buffer the compressor\n  \
    \ decided to use for a given Packet. The basis of this decision is up\n   to the\
    \ implementor. The number of buffers and size of each buffer is\n   negotiated.\n\
    \   A CID of 0 indicates that the Packet by Packet context will be used\n   if\
    \ it has been negotiated. The Packet by Packet context is cleared\n   between\
    \ Packets so that this History Buffer is not maintained across\n   Packet boundaries.\n"
- title: Packet Integrity Byte (PIB)
  contents:
  - "Packet Integrity Byte (PIB)\n   To ensure that Packets are being compressed and\
    \ decompressed\n   correctly and to ensure History Buffer synchronization is maintained,\n\
    \   a Packet Integrity Byte is added to the packet header.\n   The packet integrity\
    \ byte is defined in the full protocol\n   specification.\n"

    \ negotiates the use of MVRCA on the\n   link. By default or ultimate disagreement,\
    \ no compression is used.\n     0                   1                   2    \

    \ specific to this compression algorithm.\n   History\n   Defines the size of\
    \ the compression history buffer.  Valid values are\n   defined in the full protocol\
    \ specification.\n   # Contexts\n   This is the number of contexts. Each context\
    \ implies the  creation of\n   a History Buffer for that context of the size \
    \ indicated in the\n   Context History field. Values are  1-63.  This value includes\
    \ both\n   the Packet by Packet context and the number of contexts for which\n\
    \   history is maintained.  Therefore, when this value is 1 and the P\n   (Packet\
    \ by Packet) flag is also 1, then only in packet compression is\n   supported\
    \ and history context is not retained across packet\n   boundaries.  The Context\
    \ Identifier (CID) starts with 1 for contexts\n   where the history is maintained.\n\
    \   P - Packet by Packet flag\n   When 1, packet by packet compression is enabled\
    \ for the context whose\n   context ID is 0.  When P is 0, packet by packet compression\
    \ is not\n   supported.\n"
