- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the two decades after publication of RFC 2026 [RFC2026],\
    \ the IETF\n   has evolved its review processes of Proposed Standard RFCs, and\
    \ thus\n   Section 4.1.1 of RFC 2026 no longer accurately describes IETF\n   Proposed\
    \ Standards.\n   This document only updates the characterization of Proposed Standards\n\
    \   from Section 4.1.1 of RFC 2026 and does not speak to or alter the\n   procedures\
    \ for the maintenance of Standards Track documents from RFC\n   2026 and RFC 6410\
    \ [RFC6410].  For complete understanding of the\n   requirements for standardization,\
    \ those documents should be read in\n   conjunction with this document.\n"
- title: 2.  IETF Review of Proposed Standards
  contents:
  - "2.  IETF Review of Proposed Standards\n   The entry-level maturity for the standards\
    \ track is \"Proposed\n   Standard\".  A specific action by the IESG is required\
    \ to move a\n   specification onto the Standards Track at the \"Proposed Standard\"\
    \n   level.\n   Initially it was intended that most IETF technical specifications\n\
    \   would progress through a series of maturity stages starting with\n   Proposed\
    \ Standard, then progressing to Draft Standard, then finally\n   to Internet Standard\
    \ (see Section 6 of RFC 2026).  For a number of\n   reasons this progression is\
    \ not common.  Many Proposed Standards are\n   actually deployed on the Internet\
    \ and used extensively, as stable\n   protocols.  This proves the point that the\
    \ community often deems it\n   unnecessary to upgrade a specification to Internet\
    \ Standard.  Actual\n   practice has been that full progression through the sequence\
    \ of\n   standards levels is typically quite rare, and most popular IETF\n   protocols\
    \ remain at Proposed Standard.  Over time, the IETF has\n   developed a more extensive\
    \ review process.\n   IETF Proposed Standards documents have been subject to open\n\
    \   development and review by the Internet technical community, generally\n  \
    \ including a number of formal cross-discipline reviews and,\n   specifically,\
    \ a security review.  This is further strengthened in\n   many cases by implementations\
    \ and even the presence of interoperable\n   code.  Hence, IETF Proposed Standards\
    \ are of such quality that they\n   are ready for the usual market-based product\
    \ development and\n   deployment efforts into the Internet.\n"
- title: 3.  Characterization of Specifications
  contents:
  - "3.  Characterization of Specifications\n   The text in the following section\
    \ replaces Section 4.1.1 of RFC 2026.\n   Section 3.2 is a verbatim copy of the\
    \ characterization of Internet\n   Standards from Section 4.1.3 of RFC 2026 and\
    \ is provided for\n   convenient reference.  The text only provides the characterization;\n\
    \   process issues for Draft and Internet Standards are described in RFC\n   2026\
    \ and its updates, specifically RFC 6410.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Characterization of IETF Proposed Standard Specifications
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Characterization of IETF Proposed Standard Specifications\n   The entry-level\
    \ maturity for the standards track is \"Proposed\n   Standard\".  A specific action\
    \ by the IESG is required to move a\n   specification onto the standards track\
    \ at the \"Proposed Standard\"\n   level.\n   A Proposed Standard specification\
    \ is stable, has resolved known\n   design choices, has received significant community\
    \ review, and\n   appears to enjoy enough community interest to be considered\
    \ valuable.\n   Usually, neither implementation nor operational experience is\n\
    \   required for the designation of a specification as a Proposed\n   Standard.\
    \  However, such experience is highly desirable and will\n   usually represent\
    \ a strong argument in favor of a Proposed Standard\n   designation.\n   The IESG\
    \ may require implementation and/or operational experience\n   prior to granting\
    \ Proposed Standard status to a specification that\n   materially affects the\
    \ core Internet protocols or that specifies\n   behavior that may have significant\
    \ operational impact on the\n   Internet.\n   A Proposed Standard will have no\
    \ known technical omissions with\n   respect to the requirements placed upon it.\
    \  Proposed Standards are\n   of such quality that implementations can be deployed\
    \ in the Internet.\n   However, as with all technical specifications, Proposed\
    \ Standards may\n   be revised if problems are found or better solutions are identified,\n\
    \   when experiences with deploying implementations of such technologies\n   at\
    \ scale is gathered.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Characteristics of Internet Standards
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Characteristics of Internet Standards\n   A specification for which significant\
    \ implementation and successful\n   operational experience has been obtained may\
    \ be elevated to the\n   Internet Standard level.  An Internet Standard (which\
    \ may simply be\n   referred to as a Standard) is characterized by a high degree\
    \ of\n   technical maturity and by a generally held belief that the specified\n\
    \   protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet\n   community.\n"
- title: 4.  Further Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Further Considerations\n   Occasionally, the IETF may choose to publish as\
    \ Proposed Standard a\n   document that contains areas of known limitations or\
    \ challenges.  In\n   such cases, any known issues with the document will be clearly\
    \ and\n   prominently communicated in the document, for example, in the\n   abstract,\
    \ the introduction, or a separate section or statement.\n"
