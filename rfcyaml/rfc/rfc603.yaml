  - "topographical map:\n    1.  AMES is 4-connected, i.e. four network connections\
    \ will go down\n        if the IMP fails.  Is there some aspiration that IMPs\
    \ should be\n        no more than three connected?\n    2.  The seven IMPS in\
    \ the Washington area are arranged into a loop.\n        This guarantees that\
    \ local communication can take place even if\n        one connection fails, and\
    \ is probably a worthwhile preparation\n        for area routing.  On the other\
    \ hand, for example, a break\n        between MIT-IPC and MIT-MAC will require\
    \ them to communicate\n        through a 12-hop path through Washington.  This\
    \ can be remedied\n        by a short (inexpensive) connection between Harvard\
    \ and Lincoln\n        Labs.  Is there a plan to pull the Boston area, the San\n\
    \        Francisco area, and the Los Angeles area into loops like the\n      \
    \  Washington area?\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for\
