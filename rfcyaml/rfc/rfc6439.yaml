  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n\
    \   protocol [RFC6325] provides optimal pair-wise data frame forwarding\n   without\
    \ configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology,\n   safe forwarding\
    \ even during periods of temporary loops, and support\n   for multipathing of\
    \ both unicast and multicast traffic.  TRILL\n   accomplishes this by using IS-IS\
    \ (Intermediate System to Intermediate\n   System) [IS-IS] [RFC1195] link state\
    \ routing and encapsulating\n   traffic using a header that includes a hop count.\
    \  The design\n   supports VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) and optimization\
    \ of the\n   distribution of multi-destination frames based on VLANs and IP-\n\
    \   derived multicast groups.  Devices that implement TRILL are called\n   \"\
    RBridges\" (Routing Bridges).\n   Section 2 of [RFC6327] explains the environment\
    \ for which the TRILL\n   protocol is designed and the differences between that\
    \ environment and\n   the typical Layer 3 routing environment.\n   TRILL supports\
    \ multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links that can\n   have multiple end stations\
    \ and RBridges attached.  Where multiple\n   RBridges are attached to a link,\
    \ native traffic to and from end\n   stations on that link is handled by a subset\
    \ of those RBridges called\n   \"Appointed Forwarders\", with the intent that\
    \ native traffic in each\n   VLAN be handled by at most one RBridge.  An RBridge\
    \ can be Appointed\n   Forwarder for many VLANs.\n   The purpose of this document\
    \ is to improve the documentation of the\n   Appointed Forwarder mechanism; thus,\
    \ it updates RFC 6325.  It\n   includes reference implementation details.  Alternative\n\
    \   implementations that interoperate on the wire are permitted.\n   The Appointed\
    \ Forwarder mechanism is irrelevant to any link on which\n   end station service\
    \ is not offered.  This includes links configured\n   as point-to-point IS-IS\
    \ links and any link with all RBridge ports on\n   that link configured as trunk\
    \ ports.  (In TRILL, configuration of a\n   port as a \"trunk port\" just means\
    \ that no end station service will be\n   provided.  It does not imply that all\
    \ VLANs are enabled on that\n   port.)\n   The Appointed Forwarder mechanism has\
    \ no effect on the formation of\n   adjacencies, the election of the Designated\
    \ RBridge (DRB) for a link,\n   MTU matching, or pseudonode formation.  Those\
    \ topics are covered in\n   [RFC6327].  Furthermore, Appointed Forwarder status\
    \ has no effect on\n   the forwarding of TRILL Data frames.  It only affects the\
    \ handling of\n   native frames.\n   For other aspects of the TRILL base protocol,\
    \ see [RFC6325] and\n   [RFC6327].  Familiarity with [RFC6325] and [RFC6327] is\
    \ assumed in\n   this document.  In case of conflict between this document and\n\
    \   [RFC6325], this document prevails.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology and Acronyms\n   This document uses the acronyms defined in\
    \ [RFC6325].\n   A \"trunk port\" is a port configured with the \"end station\

    \   In this document, the term \"link\" means \"bridged LAN\", that is to say\n\
    \   some combination of physical links with zero or more bridges, hubs,\n   repeaters,\
    \ or the like.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\

- title: 2.  Appointed Forwarders and Their Appointment
  contents:
  - "2.  Appointed Forwarders and Their Appointment\n   The Appointed Forwarder on\
    \ a link for VLAN-x is the RBridge that\n   ingresses native frames from the link\
    \ and egresses native frames to\n   the link in VLAN-x.  By default, the DRB (Designated\
    \ RBridge) on a\n   link is in charge of native traffic for all VLANs on the link.\
    \  The\n   DRB may, if it wishes, act as Appointed Forwarder for any VLAN and\
    \ it\n   may appoint other RBridges that have ports on the link as Appointed\n\
    \   Forwarder for one or more VLANs.\n   It is important that there not be two\
    \ Appointed Forwarders on a link\n   that are ingressing and egressing native\
    \ frames for the same VLAN at\n   the same time.  Should this occur, it could\
    \ form a loop where frames\n   are not protected by a TRILL Hop Count for part\
    \ of the loop.  (Such a\n   condition can even occur through two Appointed Forwarders\
    \ for two\n   different VLANs, VLAN-x and VLAN-y, if ports or bridges inside the\n\
    \   link are configured to map frames between VLAN-x and VLAN-y as\n   discussed\
    \ in Section 2.4.)  While TRILL tries to avoid such\n   situations, for loop safety\
    \ there is also an \"inhibition\" mechanism\n   (see Section 3) that can cause\
    \ an RBridge that is an Appointed\n   Forwarder to not ingress or egress native\
    \ frames.\n   As discussed in Section 5, an RBridge may have multiple ports on\
    \ a\n   link.  As discussed in [RFC6327], if there are multiple ports with\n \
    \  the same Media Access Control (MAC) address on a link, all but one\n   will\
    \ be suspended.  The case of multiple ports on a link for one\n   RBridge and\
    \ the case of multiple ports with the same MAC address on a\n   link and combinations\
    \ of these cases are fully accommodated; however,\n   multiple ports on a link\
    \ for one RBridge is expected to be a rare\n   condition and duplicate MAC addresses\
    \ are not recommended by either\n   TRILL or IEEE 802.1 standards.\n   Appointed\
    \ Forwarder status has no effect on the forwarding of TRILL\n   Data frames. \
    \ It only affects the handling of native frames.\n   There are three mechanisms\
    \ by which an RBridge can be appointed or\n   un-appointed as Appointed Forwarder:\
    \ as a result of the DRB elections\n   [RFC6327] as discussed in Section 2.1,\
    \ as a result of action by the\n   DRB as discussed in Section 2.2, as a result\
    \ of a local configuration\n   action as discussed in Section 2.3.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Appointment Effects of DRB Elections
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Appointment Effects of DRB Elections\n   When an RBridge believes that\
    \ it has become the DRB on a link, by\n   default, it can act as Appointed Forwarder\
    \ for any VLANs on that link\n   that it chooses as long as its port is not configured\
    \ as a trunk port\n   and has that VLAN enabled (or at least one of its ports\
    \ meets these\n   criteria, if it has more than one port on the link).\n   An\
    \ RBridge loses all Appointed Forwarder status when:\n   1.  it decides that it\
    \ has lost the status of being the DRB for a\n       link; or\n   2.  it observes\
    \ a change in the RBridge that is the DRB for the link\n       without itself\
    \ becoming the DRB.\n   In the rare corner case where an RBridge has more than\
    \ one port on a\n   link, one of which was previously the DRB election winner\
    \ but has\n   just lost the DRB election to a different port of the same RBridge\n\
    \   (possibly due to management configuration of port priorities), there\n   is\
    \ no change in which RBridge is the DRB.  Therefore, neither of the\n   above\
    \ points applies and there is no change in Appointed Forwarder\n   status.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Appointment and Removal by the DRB
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Appointment and Removal by the DRB\n   The DRB may appoint other RBridges\
    \ on the link through inclusion of\n   one or more Appointed Forwarders sub-TLVs\
    \ [RFC6326] in a TRILL Hello\n   it sends on the Designated VLAN out the port\
    \ that won the DRB\n   election.  When the DRB sends any appointments in a TRILL\
    \ Hello, it\n   must send all appointments for that link in that Hello.  Any previous\n\
    \   appointment not included is implicitly revoked.\n   Although the DRB does\
    \ not need to announce the VLANs for which it has\n   chosen to act as Appointed\
    \ Forwarder by sending appoints for itself,\n   if the DRB wishes to revoke all\
    \ appointments for RBridges other than\n   itself on the link, it is recommended\
    \ that it send a TRILL Hello with\n   an appointment for itself for some VLAN.\n\
    \   The DRB MUST NOT send any appointments on a link unless its DRB\n   inhibition\
    \ timer (see Section 3) for that link is expired.\n   How the DRB decides what\
    \ other RBridges on the link, if any, to\n   appoint forwarder for which VLANs\
    \ is beyond the scope of this\n   document.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Processing Forwarder Appointments
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Processing Forwarder Appointments\n   When a non-DRB RBridge that can\
    \ offer end station service on a link\n   receives a TRILL Hello that is not discarded\
    \ for one of the reasons\n   given in [RFC6327], it checks the source MAC address\
    \ and the Port ID\n   and System ID in the Hello to determine if it is from the\
    \ winning DRB\n   port.  If it is not from that port, any Appointed Forwarder\
    \ sub-TLVs\n   in the Hello are ignored, and there is no change in the receiving\n\
    \   RBridge's Appointed Forwarder status.  Also, if no Appointed\n   Forwarder\
    \ sub-TLVs are present in the TRILL Hello, there is no change\n   in the receiver's\
    \ Appointed Forwarder status.\n   However, if the TRILL Hello is from the winning\
    \ DRB port and the\n   Hello includes one or more Appointed Forwarder sub-TLVs,\
    \ then the\n   receiving RBridge becomes appointed for the VLANs that are both\n\
    \   listed for it in the Hello and are enabled on the receiving port.\n   (If\
    \ the appointment includes VLAN IDs 0x000 or 0xFFF, they are\n   ignored, but\
    \ any other VLAN IDs are still effective.)  If the\n   receiver was Appointed\
    \ Forwarder for any other VLANs, its Appointed\n   Forwarder status for such other\
    \ VLANs is revoked.  For example, if\n   none of these sub-TLVs in a Hello appoints\
    \ the receiving RBridge,\n   then it loses all Appointed Forwarder status and\
    \ is no longer\n   Appointed Forwarder for any VLAN on the port where the Hello\
    \ was\n   received.\n   The handling of one or more Appointed Forwarder sub-TLVs\
    \ in a Hello\n   from the winning port that appoints the receiving RBridge is\
    \ as\n   follows.  An appointment in an Appointed Forwarder sub-TLV is for a\n\
    \   specific RBridge and a contiguous interval of VLAN IDs; however, as\n   stated\
    \ above, it actually appoints that RBridge forwarder only for\n   the VLAN(s)\
    \ in that range that are enabled on one or more ports that\n   RBridge has on\
    \ the link (ignoring any ports configured as trunk ports\n   or as IS-IS point-to-point\
    \ ports).  If the RBridge was Appointed\n   Forwarder for any additional VLANs\
    \ beyond the VLANs for which it was\n   being appointed, it loses Appointed Forwarder\
    \ status for such\n   additional VLANs.\n   There is no reason for an RBridge\
    \ to remember that it received a\n   valid appointment message for a VLAN that\
    \ was ineffective because the\n   VLAN was not enabled on the port where the message\
    \ was received or\n   because the port was a trunk or point-to-point port.  It\
    \ does not\n   become Appointed Forwarder for such a VLAN just because that VLAN\
    \ is\n   later enabled or the port later reconfigured.\n   It should be straightforward\
    \ for the DRB to send, within one Hello,\n   the appointments for several dozen\
    \ VLAN IDs or several dozen blocks\n   of contiguous VLAN IDs.  Should the VLANs\
    \ the DRB wishes to appoint\n   be inconveniently distributed, for example, the\
    \ proverbial case where\n   the DRB RB1 wishes to appoint RB2 forwarder for all\
    \ even-numbered\n   VLANs and appoint RB3 forwarder for all odd-numbered VLANs,\
    \ the\n   following method may be used.  The network manager normally controls\n\
    \   what VLANs are enabled on RBridge port.  Thus, the network manager\n   can\
    \ appoint an RBridge forwarder for an arbitrary set of scattered\n   VLANs by\
    \ enabling only those VLANs on the relevant port (or ports)\n   and then having\
    \ the DRB send an appointment that appears to appoint\n   the target RBridge forwarder\
    \ for all VLANs.  However, for proper\n   operation and inter-RBridge communication,\
    \ the Designated VLAN for a\n   link SHOULD be enabled on all RBridge ports on\
    \ that link, and it may\n   not be desired to appoint the RBridge forwarder for\
    \ the Designated\n   VLAN.  Thus, in the general case, it would require two appointments,\n\
    \   although it would still only require one appointment if the\n   Designated\
    \ VLAN were an extreme low or high value such as VLAN 0xFFE\n   or the default\
    \ VLAN 1.\n   For example, assume the DRB wants RB2 to be Appointed Forwarder\
    \ for\n   all even-numbered VLANs and the Designated VLAN for the link is VLAN\n\
    \   101.  The network manager could cause all even-numbered VLANs plus\n   VLAN\
    \ 101 to be enabled on the relevant port of RB2 and then, with the\n   desired\
    \ effect, cause the DRB to send appointments to RB2 appointing\n   it forwarder\
    \ for all VLANs from 1 through 100 and from 102 through\n   4,094.\n   Should\
    \ the network manager have misconfigured the enabled VLANs and\n   Appointed Forwarders,\
    \ resulting in two RBridges believing they are\n   Appointed Forwarders for the\
    \ same VLAN, then item 4 in Section 3 will\n   cause one or more of the RBridges\
    \ to be inhibited for that VLAN.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Frequency of Appointments
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Frequency of Appointments\n   It is not necessary for the DRB to include\
    \ the forwarder appointments\n   in every TRILL Hello that it sends on the Designated\
    \ VLAN for a link.\n   For loop safety, every RBridge is required to indicate,\
    \ in every\n   TRILL Hello it sends in VLAN-x on a link, whether it is an Appointed\n\
    \   Forwarder for VLAN-x for that link (see item 4 in Section 3).  It is\n   also\
    \ RECOMMENDED that the DRB have all VLANs for which end station\n   service will\
    \ be offered on the link as well as the Designated VLAN,\n   enabled.  Thus, the\
    \ DRB will generally be informed by other RBridges\n   on the link of the VLANs\
    \ for which they believe they are Appointed\n   Forwarder.  If this matches the\
    \ appointments the DRB wishes to make,\n   it is not required to re-send its forwarder\
    \ appointments; however,\n   for robustness, especially in cases such as VLAN\
    \ misconfigurations in\n   a bridged LAN link, it is RECOMMENDED that the DRB\
    \ send its forwarder\n   appointments on the Designated VLAN at least once per\
    \ its Holding\n   Time on the port that won the DRB election.\n"
- title: 2.2.3.  Appointed Forwarders Limit
  contents:
  - "2.2.3.  Appointed Forwarders Limit\n   The mechanism of DRB forwarder appointment\
    \ and the limited length of\n   TRILL Hellos impose a limit on the number of RBridges\
    \ on a link that\n   can be Appointed Forwarders.  To obtain a conservative estimate,\n\
    \   assume that no more than 1000 bytes are available in a TRILL Hello\n   for\
    \ such appointments.  Assume it is desired to appoint various\n   RBridges on\
    \ a link forwarder for arbitrary non-intersecting sets of\n   VLANs.  Using the\
    \ technique discussed above would generally require\n   two appointments, or 12\
    \ bytes, per RBridge.  With allowance for\n   sub-TLV and TLV overhead, appointments\
    \ for 83 RBridges would fit in\n   under 1000 bytes.  Including the DRB, this\
    \ implies a link with 84 or\n   more RBridges attached.  Links with more than\
    \ a handful of RBridges\n   attached are expected to be rare.\n   Note: If the\
    \ Designated VLAN were an extreme low or high value, such\n   as VLAN 1, which\
    \ is the default and may be a common value in\n   practice, only 6 bytes per RBridge\
    \ would be required.  This would\n   permit twice as many different Appointed\
    \ Forwarder RBridges than\n   indicated by the general analysis above or, alternatively,\
    \ would take\n   only half as much space to appoint the same number of Appointed\n\
    \   Forwarders.\n   Unnecessary changes in Appointed Forwarders SHOULD NOT be\
    \ made as\n   they may result in transient lack of end station service.  Large\n\
    \   numbers of Appointed Forwarders on a link (in excess of 65) are NOT\n   RECOMMENDED\
    \ due to the complexity of their establishment and\n   maintenance.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Local Configuration Action Appointment Effects
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Local Configuration Action Appointment Effects\n   Disabling VLAN-x at\
    \ an RBridge port cancels any Appointed Forwarder\n   status that RBridge has\
    \ for VLAN-x unless VLAN-x is enabled on some\n   other port that the RBridge\
    \ has connected to the same link.\n   Configuring a port as a trunk port or point-to-point\
    \ port revokes any\n   Appointed Forwarder status that depends on enabled VLANs\
    \ at that\n   port.\n   Causing a port to no longer be configured as a trunk or\

    \   the RBridge to become an Appointed Forwarder for the link that port\n   is\
    \ on.  However, such actions can allow the port's RBridge to become\n   Appointed\
    \ Forwarder by choice if it is the DRB or by appointment, if\n   it is not the\
    \ DRB on the link.\n"
- title: 2.4.  VLAN Mapping within a Link
  contents:
  - "2.4.  VLAN Mapping within a Link\n   TRILL Hellos include a field that is set\
    \ to the VLAN in which they\n   are sent.  If they arrive on a different VLAN,\
    \ then VLAN mapping is\n   occurring within the link.  (Such VLAN mapping within\
    \ a link between\n   RBridges should not be confused with VLAN mapping inside\
    \ an RBridge\n   [VLANMAP]).  VLAN mapping between VLAN-x and VLAN-y can lead\
    \ to a\n   loop if the Appointed Forwarders for the VLANs are different.  If\n\
    \   such mapping within a link was allowed and occurred on two or more\n   links\
    \ so that there was a cycle of VLAN mappings, a broadcast frame,\n   for example,\
    \ would loop forever.\n   To prevent this potential problem, if the DRB on a link\
    \ detects VLAN\n   mapping by receiving a Hello in VLAN-x that was sent on VLAN-y,\
    \ it\n   MUST make or revoke appointments so as to assure that the same\n   RBridge\
    \ (possibly the DRB) is the Appointed Forwarder on the link for\n   both VLAN-x\
    \ and VLAN-y.\n"
- title: 3.  The Inhibition Mechanism
  contents:
  - "3.  The Inhibition Mechanism\n   An RBridge has, for every link on which it can\
    \ offer end station\n   service (that is every link for which it can act as an\
    \ Appointed\n   Forwarder), the following timers denominated in seconds:\n   -\
    \ a DRB inhibition timer,\n   - a root change inhibition timer, and\n   - up to\
    \ 4,094 VLAN inhibition timers, one for each legal VLAN ID.\n   The DRB and root\
    \ change inhibition timers MUST be implemented.\n   The loss of native traffic\
    \ due to inhibition will be minimized by\n   logically implementing a VLAN inhibition\
    \ timer per each VLAN for\n   which end station service will ever be offered by\
    \ the RBridge on the\n   link; this SHOULD be done.  (See the Appendix for an\
    \ example\n   motivating VLAN inhibition timers.)  However, if implementation\n\
    \   limitations make a full set of such timers impractical, the VLAN\n   inhibition\
    \ timers for more than one VLAN can, with care, be merged\n   into one timer.\
    \  In particular, an RBridge MUST NOT merge the VLAN\n   inhibition timers together\
    \ for two VLANs if it is the Appointer\n   Forwarder for one and not for the other,\
    \ as this can lead to\n   unnecessary indefinitely prolonged inhibition.  In the\
    \ limit, there\n   will be safe operations, albeit with more native frame loss\
    \ than\n   would otherwise be required, even if only two VLAN inhibition timers\n\
    \   are provided: one for VLANs for which the RBridge is the Appointed\n   Forwarder\
    \ and one for all other VLANs.  At least two VLAN inhibition\n   timers MUST be\
    \ implemented.  Where a VLAN inhibition timer represents\n   more than one VLAN,\
    \ an update or test that would have been done to\n   the timer for any of the\
    \ VLANs is performed on the merged timer.\n   These timers are set as follows:\n\
    \   1.  On booting or management reset, each port will have its own set\n    \
    \   of timers, even if two or more such ports are on the same link,\n       because\
    \ the RBridge will not have had a chance to learn that yet.\n       All inhibition\
    \ timers are set to expired except the DRB\n       inhibition timer that is set\
    \ in accordance with item 2 below.\n       The DRB inhibition timer is handled\
    \ differently because each port\n       will initially believe it is the DRB.\n\
    \   2.  When an RBridge decides that it has become the DRB on a link,\n      \
    \ including when it is first booted or reset by management, it sets\n       the\
    \ DRB inhibition timer to the Holding Time of its port on that\n       link that\
    \ won the DRB election.\n   3.  When an RBridge decides that it has lost DRB status\
    \ on a link, it\n       sets the DRB inhibition timer to expired.\n       Note:\
    \ In the rare corner case where one port of an RBridge was\n       the DRB election\
    \ winner, but later lost the DRB election to a\n       different port of the same\
    \ RBridge on that link (perhaps due to\n       management configuration of port\
    \ priority), neither 2 nor 3 above\n       applies, and the DRB timer is not changed.\n\
    \   4.  When an RBridge RB1 receives a TRILL Hello asserting that the\n      \
    \ sender is the Appointed Forwarder that either (1) arrives on\n       VLAN-x\
    \ or (2) was sent on VLAN-x as indicated inside the Hello,\n       then RB1 sets\
    \ its VLAN-x inhibition timer for the link to the\n       maximum of that timer's\
    \ existing value and the Holding Time in\n       the received Hello.  An RBridge\
    \ MUST maintain VLAN inhibition\n       timers for a link to which it connects\
    \ if it can offer end\n       station service on that link even if it is not currently\n\
    \       Appointed Forwarder for any VLAN on that link.\n   5.  When an RBridge\
    \ RB1 enables VLAN-x on a port connecting to a link\n       and VLAN-x was previously\
    \ not enabled on any of RB1's ports on\n       that link, it sets its VLAN inhibition\
    \ timer for VLAN-x for that\n       link to its Holding Time for that port.  This\
    \ is done even if the\n       port is configured as a trunk or point-to-point\
    \ port as long as\n       there is some chance it might later be configured not\
    \ to be a\n       trunk or point-to-point port.\n   6.  When an RBridge detects\
    \ a change in the common spanning tree root\n       bridge on a port, it sets\
    \ its root change inhibition timer for\n       the link to an amount of time that\
    \ defaults to 30 seconds and is\n       configurable to any value from 30 down\
    \ to zero seconds.  This\n       condition will not occur unless the RBridge is\
    \ receiving Bridge\n       PDU (BPDUs) on the port from an attached bridged LAN.\
    \  It is safe\n       to configure this inhibition time to the settling time of\
    \ an\n       attached bridged LAN.  For example, if it is known that Rapid\n \
    \      Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP [802.1Q]) is running throughout the\n    \
    \   attached bridged LAN, it should be safe to configure this\n       inhibition\
    \ time to 7 seconds or, if the attached bridges have\n       been configured to\
    \ have a minimum Bridge Hello Timer, safe to\n       configure it to 4 seconds.\
    \  Note that, while an RBridge could\n       determine what version of spanning\
    \ tree is running on the\n       physical link between it and any directly connected\
    \ bridge by\n       examination of the BPDUs it receives, it could not tell if\n\
    \       inter-bridge links beyond those directly connected bridges were\n    \
    \   running classic Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), which might require\n      \
    \ the root change inhibition timer to be set to 30 seconds for\n       safety.\n\
    \   7.  When an RBridge decides that one of its ports (or a set of its\n     \
    \  ports) P1 is on the same link as another of its ports (or set of\n       its\
    \ ports) P2, then the inhibition timers are merged to a single\n       set of\
    \ inhibition timers by using the maximum value of the\n       corresponding timers.\n\
    \   8.  When an RBridge decides that a set of its ports that it had been\n   \
    \    treating as being on the same link are no longer on the same\n       link,\
    \ those ports will necessarily be on two or more links (one\n       link per port\
    \ in the limit).  This is handled by cloning a copy\n       of the timers for\
    \ each of the two or more links to which the\n       RBridge has decided these\
    \ ports connect.\n"

  - "4.  Inhibited Appointed Forwarder Behavior\n   An Appointed Forwarder for a link\

    \ receives\n   a TRILL Data frame whose encapsulated frame is in VLAN-x and would\n\
    \   normally be egressed to that link, it decapsulates the native frame\n   as\
    \ usual.  However, it does not output it to or queue it for that\n   link, although,\
    \ if appropriate (for example, the frame is multi-\n   destination), it may output\
    \ it to or queue it for other links.\n   If a VLAN-x Appointed Forwarder for a\
    \ link is inhibited and receives\n   a native frame in VLAN-x that would normally\
    \ be ingressed from that\n   link, the native frame is ignored except for address\
    \ learning.\n   An RBridge with one or more unexpired inhibition timers, possibly\n\
    \   including an unexpired inhibition timer for VLAN-x, is still required\n  \
    \ to indicate in TRILL Hellos it sends on VLAN-x whether or not it is\n   Appointed\
    \ Forwarder for VLAN-x for the port on which it sends the\n   Hello.\n   Inhibition\
    \ has no effect on the receipt or forwarding of TRILL Data\n   frames.\n"
- title: 5.  Multiple Ports on the Same Link
  contents:
  - "5.  Multiple Ports on the Same Link\n   An RBridge may have multiple ports on\
    \ the same link.  Some of these\n   ports may be suspended due to MAC address\
    \ duplication as described in\n   [RFC6327].  Suspended ports never ingress or\
    \ egress native frames.\n   If an RBridge has one or more non-suspended ports\
    \ on a link and those\n   ports offer end station service, that is, those ports\
    \ are not\n   configured as point-to-point or trunk ports, then that RBridge is\n\
    \   eligible to be an Appointed Forwarder for that link.  It can become\n   Appointed\
    \ Forwarder either by its choice, because it is the DRB, or\n   by appointment\
    \ by the DRB as described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2.\n   If an RBridge that is the\
    \ Appointed Forwarder for VLAN-x on a link\n   has multiple non-suspended ports\
    \ on that link, it may load share the\n   task of ingressing and egressing VLAN-x\
    \ native frames across those\n   ports however it chooses, as long as there is\
    \ no case in which a\n   frame it egresses onto the link from one port can be\
    \ ingressed on\n   another of its ports, creating a loop.  If the RBridge is the\n\
    \   Appointed Forwarder for multiple VLANs, a straightforward thing to do\n  \
    \ would be to partition those VLANs among the ports it has on the link.\n"

- title: Appendix.  VLAN Inhibition Example
  contents:
  - "Appendix.  VLAN Inhibition Example\n   The per-VLAN inhibition timers (or the\
    \ equivalent) are needed to be\n   loop safe in the case of misconfigured bridges\
    \ on a link.\n   For a simple example, assume that RB1 and RB2 are the only RBridges\n\
    \   on the link, that RB1 is higher priority to be the DRB, and that they\n  \
    \ both want VLAN 1 (the default) to be the Designated VLAN.  However,\n   there\
    \ is a bridge between them configured so that RB1 can see all the\n   frames sent\
    \ by RB2 but none of the frames from RB1 can get through to\n   RB2.\n   Both\
    \ will think they are the DRB.  RB1 because it is higher priority\n   even though\
    \ it sees the Hellos from RB2, and RB2 because it doesn't\n   see the Hellos from\
    \ RB1 and therefore thinks it is highest priority.\n   Say RB1 chooses to act\
    \ as Appointed Forwarder for VLANs 2 and 3 while\n   RB2 chooses to act as Appointed\
    \ Forwarder for VLANs 3 and 4.  There\n   is no problem with VLANs 2 and 4 but\
    \ if you do not do something about\n   it, you could have a loop involving VLAN\
    \ 3.  RB1 will see the Hellos\n   RB2 issues on VLAN 3 declaring itself Appointed\
    \ Forwarder, so RB1\n   will be inhibited on VLAN 3.  RB2 does not see the Hellos\
    \ issued by\n   RB1 on VLAN 3, so RB2 will become uninhibited and will handle\
    \ VLAN 3\n   native traffic.\n   However, this situation may change.  RB2 might\
    \ crash, the bridge\n   might crash, or RB2 might be reconfigured so it no longer\
    \ tried to\n   act as Appointed Forwarder for VLAN 3, or other issues may occur.\n\
    \   So, RB1 has to maintain a VLAN 3 inhibition timer, and if it sees no\n   Hellos\
    \ from any other RBridge on the link claiming to be Appointed\n   Forwarder for\
    \ VLAN 3 in a long enough time, then RB1 becomes\n   uninhibited for that VLAN\
    \ on the port in question and can handle end\n   station traffic in VLAN 3.\n"
