Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for monitoring and controlling HPR (High Performance Routing) network devices which have the capability to communicate in IP (Internet Protocol) networks.
This memo identifies managed objects for the HPR in IP network communications.
This document is a product of the SNA NAU Services MIB Working Group.
It defines a MIB module for managing devices with HPR in IP networks capabilities.
The SNMP Network Management Framework
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2478 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275 [15].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
This document identifies a set of objects for monitoring the configuration and active characteristics of devices with HPR in IP network capabilities.
HPR is an enhancement to the Advanced Peer  to Peer Network (APPN) architecture that provides fast data routing and improved session reliability.
APPN is the aspect of Systems Network Architecture (SNA) that supports peer to peer networking.
APPN/HPR in IP Networks is a further enhancement to the APPN/HPR architecture, described in RFC 2353 [18].
It provides a method with which APPN/HPR nodes can communicate in IP networks.
APPN management information is defined by the APPN MIB [19].
HPR management information is defined by the HPR MIB, RFC 2238 [20].
Highlights of the management functions supported by the APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB module include the following:
A count of UDP packets sent with each type of APPN traffic on HPR/IP links.
Monitoring and setting configuration parameters for the mappings between APPN traffic types on Type of Service (TOS)
Precedence settings in the IP header.
Note that the TOS Precedence settings have been redefined in RFC 2474 [21] as the first three bits of the differentiated services code point (DSCP).
HPR/IP Values for Objects in the APPN MIB Ports and link stations are the APPN device's interface to the data link control (DLC), which provides the physical transport, or to another protocol, such as IP.
These objects all have the syntax IANAifType, and the value 126, defined as "IP (for APPN HPR in IP networks)" shall be returned when they identify an HPR/IP port or link station.
These objects have the syntax DisplayableDlcAddress, defined in the APPN MIB as a textual convention to represent the address as an octet string of ASCII characters.
The following two objects return object identifiers that tie port and link table entries in the APPN MIB to lower layer
Both objects should return a RowPointer to the ifEntry in the agent's ifTable for the physical interface associated with the local IP address for the port.
If the agent implements the IP MIB (RFC 2011), this association between the IP address and the physical interface will be represented in the ipNetToMediaTable.
These groups are described below in more detail.
The hprIpMonitoringGroup group consists of the hprIpActiveLsTable.
This table is indexed by the link station name and traffic type, and contains a counter for the number of UDP packets sent on a link station for that traffic type.
The hprIpMonitoringGroup group consists of the following objects and tables: 1) hprIpAppnPortTable
This table supports reading and setting the default mapping between APPN traffic types and TOS Precedence settings for all link stations using a port.
This mapping may be overridden for individual link stations or individual connection networks.
This table supports reading and setting the mappings between APPN traffic types and TOS Precedence settings for an individual link station and APPN traffic type.
If there is no entry in this table for a given link station and traffic type, then that link station inherits its mapping from its port.
This table supports reading and setting the mapping between APPN traffic types and TOS Precedence settings for an individual connection network and traffic type.
If there is no entry in this table for a given connection network and traffic type, then that connection network inherits its mapping from its port.

This module contains two groups:  the HPR over IP Monitoring Group provides a count of the UDP packets sent by a link station for each APPN traffic type.
the HPR over IP Configuration Group provides for reading and setting the mappings between APPN traffic types and TOS Precedence settings in the IP header.
These mappings are configured at the APPN port level, and are inherited by the APPN connection networks and link stations associated with an APPN port.
A port level mapping can, however, be overridden for a particular connection network or link station."

A node may have connections to a given connection network through multiple ports.
There is no provision in the HPR IP architecture for variations in TOS Precedence values for a single connection network based on the port through which traffic is flowing to the connection network.
Thus an entry in this table overrides the port level settings for all the ports through which the node can reach the connection network."

Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered sensitive in some network environments.
Therefore, authentication of received SNMP requests and controlled access to management information SHOULD be employed in such environments.
An authentication protocol is defined in [12].
A protocol for access control is defined in [15].
It is a customer responsibility to properly set up access control for MIB access.
None of the read only objects in this MIB reports a password, user data, or anything else that is particularly sensitive.
Some enterprises view their network configuration itself, as well as information about network usage and performance, as corporate assets; such enterprises may wish to restrict SNMP access to most of the objects in the MIB.
The one read write and four read create objects in the MIB can affect network operations; it is recommended that SNMP access to these objects be restricted.
Setting this object immediately changes the mapping for all link stations using this port which do not have an entry to override the port value.
Improper mappings may cause delays or disruptions in the network.
For example, if APPN traffic type 'High' is mapped to IP TOS Precedence bits ' 001', network control traffic will have the same TOS precedence as bulk data traffic.
This may cause delays with session initializations, and timeouts on control sessions that could cause network outages.
hprIpLsTOSPrecedence:  Setting this object has the potential for delay or disruption for this link station as described above with hprIpPortTOSPrecedence.
Setting this object to delete(6) causes this link station to revert to the default TOS Precedence mapping for its port.
The customized mapping for this link station will no longer be in effect.
hprIpCnTOSPrecedence:  Setting this object has the potential for delay or disruption for this links created for this connection network as described above with hprIpPortTOSPrecedence.
Setting this object to delete(6) causes links created for this connection network to revert to the default TOS Precedence mapping for its port.
The customized mapping for this connection network will no longer be in effect.
