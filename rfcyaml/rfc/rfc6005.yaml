  - "1.  Introduction\n   [MEF6] and [G.8011] provide parallel frameworks for defining
    network-\n   oriented characteristics of Ethernet services in transport networks.\n
    \  The framework discusses general Ethernet connection characteristics,\n   Ethernet
    User Network Interfaces (UNIs), and Ethernet Network-Network\n   Interfaces (NNIs).
    \ Within this framework, [G.8011.1] defines the\n   Ethernet Private Line (EPL)
    service and [G.8011.2] defines the\n   Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL) service.
    [MEF6] covers both\n   service types.  [MEF10.1] defines service parameters and
    [MEF11]\n   provides UNI requirements and framework.\n   This document provides
    a method for GMPLS-based control of Label\n   Switched Paths (LSPs) that support
    the transport services defined in\n   the above documents at the UNI network reference
    points.  This\n   document does not define or limit the underlying intra-domain
    or\n   Internal NNI (I-NNI) technology used to support the UNI.  This\n   document
    makes use of the GMPLS extensions defined in [RFC6004] and\n   [RFC6002].\n   The
    scope of this document covers Ethernet UNI applications, and it\n   is intended
    to be consistent with the GMPLS overlay model presented\n   in [RFC4208] and aligned
    with GMPLS Core Network signaling.  The\n   scope and reference model used in
    this document are represented in\n   Figure 1, which is based on Figure 1 of [RFC4208].\n
    \  Figure 1 shows two core networks, each containing two core nodes.\n   The core
    nodes are labeled 'CN'.  Connected to each CN is an edge\n   node.  The edge nodes
    are labeled 'EN'.  Each EN supports Ethernet\n   Networks and use Ethernet services
    provided by the core nodes via a\n   UNI.  Two services are represented: one EPL
    and one EVPL type\n   service.  Signaling within the core network is out of scope
    of this\n   document and may include any technology that supports overlay UNI\n
    \  services.  The UNI function in the edge node can be referred to as\n   the
    UNI client, or UNI-C, and in the CN as UNI network, or UNI-N.\n        Ethernet

    - "1.1.  Overview\n   This document uses a common approach to supporting the switching\n
      \  implied by the Ethernet services defined in [MEF6], [G.8011.1], and\n   [G.8011.2].
      \ The approach builds on standard GMPLS mechanisms to\n   deliver the required
      control capabilities.  This document reuses the\n   GMPLS mechanisms specified
      in [RFC6004], [RFC4208], and [RFC4974].\n   Support for Point-to-Point (P2P)
      and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP)\n   service is required by [G.8011] and
      [MEF11].  P2P service delivery\n   support is based on the GMPLS support for
      Ethernet services covered\n   in [RFC6004].  As with [RFC6004], the definition
      of support for MP2MP\n   service is left for future study and is not addressed
      in this\n   document.\n   [MEF11] defines multiple types of control for UNI
      Ethernet services.\n   In MEF UNI Type 1, services are configured manually.
      \ In MEF UNI Type\n   2, services may be configured manually or via a link management\n
      \  interface.  In MEF UNI Type 3, services may be established and\n   managed
      via a signaling interface.  As with [RFC6004], this document\n   is aimed at
      supporting the MEF UNI Type 3 mode of operation (and not\n   MEF UNI Types 1
      and 2).  As mentioned above, this document is limited\n   to covering UNI-specific
      topics.\n   Common procedures used to signal Ethernet connections are described\n
      \  in Section 2 of this document.  Procedures related to signaling\n   switching
      in support of EPL services are described in Section 3.\n   Procedures related
      to signaling switching in support of EVPL services\n   are described in Section
      4.\n"

    the procedures\n   related to the processing of Resource ReSerVation Protocol
    (RSVP)\n   objects is not modified by this document.  The relevant procedures

      the mechanisms\n   defined in this document MUST use the addressing and other

      egress\n   edge node's IP address in the endpoint address field in the SESSION\n
      \  object.\n   One issue that presents itself with the addressing approach taken
      in\n   [RFC4208] is that an ingress edge node may not receive the egress\n   edge
      node's IP address as part of the management, or other, request\n   that results
      in the initiation of a new Ethernet connection.  This\n   case is covered as
      described in Section 7.2 of [RFC4974] and modified\n   below in Section 2.2.1.\n"

    - "2.2.  Ethernet Endpoint (UNI) Identification\n   UNI identification, except
      as noted below, MUST follow Ethernet\n   endpoint (UNI) identification as defined
      in [RFC6004].  There is one\n   additional case that is covered in this document
      where the scope of\n   the Ethernet endpoint identifier is relevant beyond the
      typical case\n   of just ingress and egress nodes.\n"
    - contents:
      - "2.2.1.  Address Resolution\n   At the UNI reference point, it is possible
        for the ingress edge node\n   to not have the egress edge node's IP address
        when initiating an LSP.\n   This presents an issue as the egress edge node's
        IP address is\n   carried in the SESSION object.  This case is handled leveraging
        the\n   approach described in Section 7.2 of [RFC4974] to address call ID\n
        \  assignment by the first core node.\n   When an edge node (the UNI-C) initiates
        an LSP and it has the egress\n   Ethernet endpoint identifier, but does not
        have its IP address, the\n   edge node MUST create a Notify message as described
        in [RFC4974].\n   The Notify message MUST include the CALL_ATTRIBUTES object
        with the\n   Endpoint ID TLV defined [RFC6004].  The tunnel endpoint address
        field\n   of the SESSION object in the Notify message MUST be set to zero
        (0).\n   The message MUST be addressed and sent to an address associated with\n
        \  the first core node.\n   When a core node, i.e., the node providing the
        network side of the\n   UNI (the UNI-N), receives a Notify message with the
        tunnel endpoint\n   address field of the SESSION object set to zero, it MUST
        locate the\n   Endpoint ID TLV in the CALL_ATTRIBUTES object.  If the object
        or TLV\n   are not present, the node MUST discard the message.  In this case,
        a\n   Message ID Acknowledgment MUST NOT be sent for the Notify message.\n
        \  When the Endpoint ID TLV is located, the node MUST map the Endpoint\n   ID
        into an IP address associated with the egress edge node.  If the\n   node
        is unable to obtain an egress address, it MUST issue an error\n   response
        Notify messages according to Section 6.2.2. of [RFC4974].\n   The Error code
        and value SHOULD be \"Routing Problem/Unknown Endpoint\"\n   (Error code 24,
        Error value 35).\n   When the node is able to obtain an egress address, the
        endpoint\n   address field of the SESSION object MUST be set to the obtained\n
        \  address, and the Notify message should be sent according to the\n   standard
        processing defined in [RFC4974].  The downstream nodes will\n   then process
        the Notify according to standard processing rules.\n   When the ingress receives
        the response Notify message, it SHOULD\n   identify the call based on the
        Endpoint ID TLV and, when not set to\n   zero on the corresponding setup Notify
        message, the short and long\n   Call IDs.  The endpoint address field of the
        SESSION object carried\n   in the response Notify message will include the
        egress's IP address.\n   This returned address MUST be used in all subsequent
        messages\n   associated with the Ethernet connection.\n   Note that the procedure
        described in this section MAY be used when\n   the Call IDs are generated
        by the initiating UNI or generated by the\n   first core node.\n"
