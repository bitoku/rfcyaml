  - "Abstract\n   This document proposes an experimental set of alternative decision-\n\
    \   making processes for use in IETF working groups.  There are a small\n   number\
    \ of cases in IETF working groups in which the group has come to\n   consensus\
    \ that a particular decision must be made but cannot agree on\n   the decision\
    \ itself.  This document describes alternative mechanisms\n   for reaching a decision\
    \ in those cases.  This is not meant to provide\n   an exhaustive list, but to\
    \ provide a known set of tools that can be\n   used when needed.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Dave Clark's much-quoted credo for the IETF describes \"\
    rough\n   consensus and running code\" as the key criteria for decision making\n\
    \   in the IETF.  Aside from a pleasing alliteration, these two\n   touchstones\
    \ provide a concise summary of the ideals that guide the\n   IETF's decision making.\
    \  The first implies an open process in which\n   any technical opinion will be\
    \ heard and any participant's concerns\n   addressed; the second implies a recognition\
    \ that any decision must be\n   grounded in solid engineering and the known characteristics\
    \ of the\n   network and its uses.  The aim of the IETF is to make the best\n\
    \   possible engineering choices and protocol standards for the Internet\n   as\
    \ a whole, and these two principles guide it in making its choices\n   and standards.\n\
    \   In a small number of cases, working groups within the IETF cannot\n   reach\
    \ consensus on a technical decision that must be made in order to\n   ensure that\
    \ an interoperable mechanism or set of standards is\n   available in some sphere.\
    \  In most of these cases, there are two or\n   more competing proposals at approximately\
    \ the same level of technical\n   maturity, deployment, and specification.  In\
    \ some cases, working\n   groups can achieve consensus to advance multiple proposals\
    \ and either\n   to revisit the question with experience or to build the required\n\
    \   mechanisms to handle multiple options for the life of the protocol.\n   In\
    \ other cases, however, a working group decides that it must advance\n   a single\
    \ proposal.\n   Choosing among proposals can be difficult especially when each\
    \ is\n   optimized for slightly different use cases, as this implies that the\n\
    \   working group's best choice depends on the participants' views of\n   likely\
    \ future use.  Further problems arise when different proposals\n   assign costs\
    \ in implementation, deployment, or use to different\n   groups, as it is a normal\
    \ human reaction to seek to prevent one's own\n   ox from being gored.\n   This\
    \ document proposes a set of experimental mechanisms for use in\n   such cases.\
    \  To gauge the results of the use of these mechanisms, the\n   Last Call issued\
    \ to the IETF community should note such a mechanism\n   is being used and which\
    \ proposal among the set was chosen.  If and\n   when the community becomes satisfied\
    \ that one or more of these\n   methods is useful, it should be documented in\
    \ a BCP.\n   In no way should this experiment or any future BCP for this small\n\
    \   number of cases take precedence over the IETF's normal mode of\n   operation.\n"
- title: 2.  Rough Consensus as a baseline approach
  contents:
  - "2.  Rough Consensus as a baseline approach\n   The Conflict Research Consortium\
    \ at the University of Colorado\n   outlines the pros and cons of consensus as\
    \ follows:\n      The advantage of consensus processes is that the resulting\n\
    \      decision is one that meets the interests of all the parties and\n     \
    \ that everyone can support.  The disadvantage is that developing\n      such\
    \ a decision can be a very slow process, involving many people\n      over a long\
    \ period of time.  There is also a relatively high\n      probability of failure.\
    \  If a quick decision is needed, the\n      consensus approach may not work.\
    \  Consensus rule processes also\n      tend to favor those that oppose change\
    \ and want to preserve the\n      status quo.  All these people have to do is\
    \ refuse to support any\n      consensus compromises and they will win (at least\
    \ as long as they\n      can delay change) [CONFLICT].\n   Using \"rough consensus\"\
    \ as a guideline limits some of the\n   disadvantages of consensus processes by\
    \ ensuring that individuals or\n   small factions cannot easily block a decision\
    \ that otherwise has\n   general support.  The touchstone of \"running code\"\
    \ can also limit the\n   disadvantages of consensus processes by requiring that\
    \ statements\n   opposing particular proposals be technically grounded.\n   These\
    \ limitations do not change the core mechanisms of consensus-\n   building, however,\
    \ and the IETF process continues to require\n   individual participants both to\
    \ use their best engineering judgment\n   to select among proposals and to balance\
    \ their own interests with\n   those of the Internet as a whole.  Active participation\
    \ and a\n   willingness to compromise, possibly on key points, are needed.\n \
    \  Historically, this has worked because a large majority of\n   participants\
    \ have recognized that the Internet's growth and\n   enhancement are more important\
    \ overall than any specific short-term\n   advantage.\n   In other words, \"rough\
    \ consensus\" is sufficient in most cases in the\n   IETF to ensure not only that\
    \ individuals or small groups are heard\n   when they raise technical objections,\
    \ but also that they cannot block\n   progress when general agreement has been\
    \ reached.  This document does\n   not suggest changing the usual mechanisms for\
    \ achieving progress; it\n   proposes mechanisms for use when a working group\
    \ has consensus that\n   it must make a decision but cannot make that decision\
    \ by the usual\n   rules.\n"
- title: 3.  Conditions for use
  contents:
  - "3.  Conditions for use\n   In general, working groups should consider using alternate\
    \ decision-\n   making processes when it is clear both that a choice must be made\
    \ and\n   that the choice cannot be made with continued discussion, refinement\n\
    \   of specifications, and implementation experience.  A guideline for\n   determining\
    \ whether these conditions have been met is included below.\n"
- title: 3.1.  There is a clear decision to be reached
  contents:
  - "3.1.  There is a clear decision to be reached\n   There must be a clear statement\
    \ of the decision to be reached.  This\n   may be in the working group's charter,\
    \ in requirements documents, or\n   in other documents developed by the working\
    \ group.  Prior to any\n   invocation of an alternate decision making process,\
    \ the Chair(s)\n   should confirm with the working group that there is general\
    \ agreement\n   on the decision to be reached.  This should include a specific\n\
    \   consensus call on whether the working group can advance multiple\n   proposals\
    \ or must select a single proposal for the work item.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Proposals are available in Draft form
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Proposals are available in Draft form\n   Proposed solutions must be available\
    \ as Internet-Drafts and must be\n   sufficiently specified so that the Chair(s)\
    \ believe they could be\n   published as an IETF specification, possibly with\
    \ further refinement.\n   If the Chair indicates that a proposed solution is insufficiently\n\
    \   specified, concrete problems must be identified, and a reasonable\n   amount\
    \ of time provided to resolve those problems must be provided.\n   Note that if\
    \ one of the proposed solutions is \"do nothing\", an\n   explicit Draft to that\
    \ effect must be available; it may, however, be\n   produced when the group invokes\
    \ an alternate decision-making process.\n"
- title: 3.3.  The working group has discussed the issue without reaching
  contents:
  - "3.3.  The working group has discussed the issue without reaching\n      resolution\n\
    \   Consensus-building requires significant amounts of discussion, and\n   there\
    \ is no general rule for indicating how much discussion a\n   technical issue\
    \ requires before a group should reach consensus.  If\n   there is any question\
    \ about whether the discussion has been\n   sufficient, the working group chair(s)\
    \ should always err on the side\n   of allowing discussion to continue.  Before\
    \ using an alternate\n   decision making process, the working group chair(s) should\
    \ also make\n   an explicit call for consensus, summarizing the technical issues\
    \ and\n   the choice to be made.  If new technical points are made during the\n\
    \   call for consensus, discussion should continue.  If no new points are\n  \
    \ raised, but the group cannot come to consensus, the working group may\n   consider\
    \ using an alternate decision making process.  Under no\n   circumstances is the\
    \ working group required to use an alternate\n   decision-making process.\n"
- title: 3.4.  There is an explicit working group last call to use an alternate
  contents:
  - "3.4.  There is an explicit working group last call to use an alternate\n    \
    \  method\n   In item 3.3 above, it is noted that the Chair(s) should make an\n\
    \   explicit call for consensus on the technical issues and should\n   proceed\
    \ only after that call has yielded no forward progress.  A\n   different Last\
    \ Call on whether to use an alternate decision-making\n   method is required,\
    \ with a stated period for comments by working\n   group members.  This is to\
    \ indicate that the decision to use an\n   alternate method should be taken at\
    \ least as seriously as the\n   decision to advance a document on the standards\
    \ track.  It also\n   provides a clear signal that this is a last moment for participants\n\
    \   to reconsider their positions.  The decision to use an alternate\n   decision\
    \ making process requires the rough consensus of the working\n   group, as determined\
    \ by the Chair(s).  The choice of which process to\n   use may be made in the\
    \ Last Call or may be the subject of separate\n   discussions within the working\
    \ group.  If the group comes to\n   consensus that an alternative method is required\
    \ but does not come to\n   consensus on the method to use, an external review\
    \ team (c.f. section\n   4.1, below) will be formed.\n   In discussions regarding\
    \ this document, several points have been\n   raised about the viability of any\
    \ mechanism that requires consensus\n   to use an alternative to consensus-based\
    \ decision making.  Some\n   individuals have pointed out that groups having trouble\
    \ achieving\n   consensus on a technical matter may have similar problems achieving\n\
    \   consensus on a procedural matter.  Others have been concerned that\n   this\
    \ will be used as an attempt to end-run around rough consensus.\n   These are\
    \ valid concerns, and they point both to the need to retain\n   rough consensus\
    \ as the baseline mechanism and the need to exercise\n   caution when using these\
    \ alternate methods.  More importantly though,\n   they highlight the nature \
    \ of these alternatives.  They are primarily\n   mechanisms that allow people\
    \ to recognize the need for compromise in\n   a new way, by backing away from\
    \ entrenched technical positions and by\n   putting the technical choice in the\
    \ hands of the broader community.\n   They highlight that the choice for each\
    \ participant is now between\n   achieving a result and failure.\n   There is\
    \ a fundamental tension between the IETF community's desire to\n   get the best\
    \ decision for a particular technical problem and its\n   desire to get a decision\
    \ that has community buy-in in the form of\n   rough consensus.  These mechanisms\
    \ cannot resolve that fundamental\n   tension.  They may, however, provide a way\
    \ forward in some situations\n   that might otherwise end in a deadlock or stagnation.\n"
- title: 4.  Alternate Methods
  contents:
  - "4.  Alternate Methods\n   In setting up an alternate method, care must be taken\
    \ that the\n   process by which the decision is reached remains open and focused\
    \ on\n   the best technical choice for the Internet as a whole.  The steps set\n\
    \   out below provide a straw proposal for four such mechanisms.  These\n   systems\
    \ are relatively heavyweight, partially to highlight the\n   gravity of invoking\
    \ these methods and partially to ensure that the\n   IETF community as a whole\
    \ is alerted to and kept informed of the\n   process.  Note that alternate procedures\
    \ have been used in the past;\n   see [RFC3127] for a description of that used\
    \ in the decision between\n   two competing candidate protocols for Authentication,\
    \ Authorization,\n   and Accounting.  By setting out these proposals, this document\
    \ does\n   not intend to limit working group choice but intends to provide a set\n\
    \   of well-defined processes that obviate the need for reinvention in\n   most\
    \ cases.\n"
