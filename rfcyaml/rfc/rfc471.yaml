  - "                 Announcement Of A (Tentative) Workshop\n                   \
    \ On Multi Site Executive Programs\nAn executive program is one which accepts\
    \ and interprets commands from a\nuser, calling upon other programs to provide\
    \ the resources required to\nsatisfy each command. There is currently interest\
    \ in making resources on\nthe ARPANET available to the user via a standard, conversational\n\
    facility which one might call an ARPANET Executive. With such a facility\na user\
    \ at a Host site or a TIP could conveniently access a wide range of\nresources\
    \ at other sites without mastering the idiosyncrasies of each\nHost operating\
    \ system which is contributing resources.\nFor example, the ARPANET executive\
    \ could make it possible to locate (by\nname) a user logged in anywhere on the\
    \ network and to establish a\nteletype link to that user in order to engage in\
    \ an on-line dialogue. It\ncould also provide status information on the subnet\
    \ and on all Hosts,\non-line ARPANET news service, on-line collections of trouble\
    \ reports,\netc.  The range of possible services is practically unlimited once\
    \ a\nbasic structure is devised for calling upon these services.\nMajor areas\
    \ of interest here are:\n1.  How can the interfaces to resources of interest be\
    \ standardized so\n    as to be accessible by \"server\" processes;\n2.  How can\
    \ communications with such server processes be standardized?\n    (an ARPANET\
    \ Executive protocol?)\n3.  To what extent can the conversational user interface\
    \ be standardized\n    in the user processes? (an ARPANET Executive language?)\n\
    4.  How can access authentication and accounting procedures be modified\n    to\
    \ permit a user to \"login\" only once, yet use resources at many\n    Host sites?\n\
    If you are interested in discussing these and related issues forward\nyour name\
    \ to Bob Thomas (BTHOMAS @BBN-TENEX), Bolt Beranek and Newman,\nInc., 50 Moulton\
    \ Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, (617) 491-1850,\nextension 483.  If\
    \ there is sufficient response, a Workshop (tentatively\nplanned for April) will\
    \ be hosted by the BBN TENEX and BBN TIP groups.\nThe Workshop will permit participants\
    \ to present relevant work and to\ndiscuss the issues raised above.\nIn the meantime,\
    \ an example of an executive program which interprets a\nlimited set of commands\
    \ in a multi-site context is available for\nexperimental use by TIP and TENEX\
    \ users. The \"N\" command of the TIP and\nthe RSEXEC (Resource Sharing Executive)\
    \ subsystem on TENEX, provide\ncommand interpretation in the context of TENEX\
    \ and ITS sites. Users\nwhose access to the network is neither via a TIP or a\
    \ TENEX may use the\nRSEXEC by directing their user TELNET to ICP to socket 367\
    \ (Octal) at\nBBN-TENEX.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form\
    \ for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with   \
    \ ]\n       [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.             9/99 ]\n"
