  - "1.  Introduction\n   Managing dispersed serial line and modem pools for large\
    \ numbers of\n   users can create the need for significant administrative support.\n\
    \   Since modem pools are by definition a link to the outside world, they\n  \
    \ require careful attention to security, authorization and accounting.\n   This\
    \ can be best achieved by managing a single \"database\" of users,\n   which allows\
    \ for authentication (verifying user name and password) as\n   well as configuration\
    \ information detailing the type of service to\n   deliver to the user (for example,\
    \ SLIP, PPP, telnet, rlogin).\n   The RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User\
    \ Service) document [4]\n   specifies the RADIUS protocol used for Authentication\
    \ and\n   Authorization.  This memo extends the use of the RADIUS protocol to\n\
    \   cover delivery of accounting information from the Network Access\n   Server\
    \ (NAS) to a RADIUS accounting server.\n   Key features of RADIUS Accounting are:\n\
    \      Client/Server Model\n         A Network Access Server (NAS) operates as\
    \ a client of the\n         RADIUS accounting server.  The client is responsible\
    \ for\n         passing user accounting information to a designated RADIUS\n \
    \        accounting server.\n         The RADIUS accounting server is responsible\
    \ for receiving the\n         accounting request and returning a response to the\
    \ client\n         indicating that it has successfully received the request.\n\
    \         The RADIUS accounting server can act as a proxy client to other\n  \
    \       kinds of accounting servers.\n      Network Security\n         Transactions\
    \ between the client and RADIUS accounting server\n         are authenticated\
    \ through the use of a shared secret, which is\n         never sent over the network.\n\
    \      Extensible Protocol\n         All transactions are comprised of variable\
    \ length Attribute-\n         Length-Value 3-tuples.  New attribute values can\
    \ be added\n         without disturbing existing implementations of the protocol.\n\
    \   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements\n   of\
    \ the specification.  These words are often capitalized.\n"
- title: 1.1  Specification of Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.1  Specification of Requirements\n   MUST      This word, or the adjective\
    \ \"required\", means that the\n             definition is an absolute requirement\
    \ of the specification.\n   MUST NOT  This phrase means that the definition is\
    \ an absolute\n             prohibition of the specification.\n   SHOULD    This\
    \ word, or the adjective \"recommended\", means that there\n             may exist\
    \ valid reasons in particular circumstances to\n             ignore this item,\
    \ but the full implications must be\n             understood and carefully weighed\
    \ before choosing a\n             different course.\n   MAY       This word, or\
    \ the adjective \"optional\", means that this\n             item is one of an\
    \ allowed set of alternatives.  An\n             implementation which does not\
    \ include this option MUST be\n             prepared to interoperate with another\
    \ implementation which\n             does include the option.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   This document uses the following terms:\n   service   The\
    \ NAS provides a service to the dial-in user, such as PPP\n             or Telnet.\n\
    \   session   Each service provided by the NAS to a dial-in user\n           \
    \  constitutes a session, with the beginning of the session\n             defined\
    \ as the point where service is first provided and\n             the end of the\
    \ session defined as the point where service\n             is ended.  A user may\
    \ have multiple sessions in parallel or\n             series if the NAS supports\
    \ that, with each session\n             generating a separate start and stop accounting\
    \ record with\n             its own Acct-Session-Id.\n   silently discard\n  \
    \           This means the implementation discards the packet without\n      \
    \       further processing.  The implementation SHOULD provide the\n         \
    \    capability of logging the error, including the contents of\n            \
    \ the silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event\n             in\
    \ a statistics counter.\n"
- title: 2.  Operation
  contents:
  - "2.  Operation\n   When a client is configured to use RADIUS Accounting, at the\
    \ start of\n   service delivery it will generate an Accounting Start packet\n\
    \   describing the type of service being delivered and the user it is\n   being\
    \ delivered to, and will send that to the RADIUS Accounting\n   server, which\
    \ will send back an acknowledgement that the packet has\n   been received.  At\
    \ the end of service delivery the client will\n   generate an Accounting Stop\
    \ packet describing the type of service\n   that was delivered and optionally\
    \ statistics such as elapsed time,\n   input and output octets, or input and output\
    \ packets.  It will send\n   that to the RADIUS Accounting server, which will\
    \ send back an\n   acknowledgement that the packet has been received.\n   The\
    \ Accounting-Request (whether for Start or Stop) is submitted to\n   the RADIUS\
    \ accounting server via the network. It is recommended that\n   the client continue\
    \ attempting to send the Accounting-Request packet\n   until it receives an acknowledgement,\
    \ using some form of backoff.  If\n   no response is returned within a length\
    \ of time, the request is re-\n   sent a number of times.  The client can also\
    \ forward requests to an\n   alternate server or servers in the event that the\
    \ primary server is\n   down or unreachable.  An alternate server can be used\
    \ either after a\n   number of tries to the primary server fail, or in a round-robin\n\
    \   fashion.  Retry and fallback algorithms are the topic of current\n   research\
    \ and are not specified in detail in this document.\n   The RADIUS accounting\
    \ server MAY make requests of other servers in\n   order to satisfy the request,\
    \ in which case it acts as a client.\n   If the RADIUS accounting server is unable\
    \ to successfully record the\n   accounting packet it MUST NOT send an Accounting-Response\n\
    \   acknowledgment to the client.\n"
