- title: 1. Introduction

  - "1. Introduction\n   This version of this memo was commissioned by the IPng area\
    \ of the\n   IETF in order to define a set of criteria to be used in evaluating\n\
    \   the protocols being proposed for adoption as the next generation of\n   IP.\n\
    \   The criteria presented here were culled from several sources,\n   including\
    \ \"IP Version 7\" [1], \"IESG Deliberations on Routing and\n   Addressing\" [2],\
    \ \"Towards the Future Internet Architecture\" [3], the\n   IPng Requirements\
    \ BOF held at the Washington D.C. IETF Meeting in\n   December of 1992, the IPng\
    \ Working Group meeting at the Seattle IETF\n   meeting in March 1994, the discussions\
    \ held on the Big-Internet\n   mailing list (big-internet@munnari.oz.au, send\
    \ requests to join to\n   big-internet-request@munnari.oz.au), discussions with\
    \ the IPng Area\n   Directors and Directorate, and the mailing lists devoted to\
    \ the\n   individual IPng efforts.\n   This document presumes that a new IP-layer\
    \ protocol is actually\n   desired. There is some discussion in the community\
    \ as to whether we\n   can extend the life of IPv4 for a significant amount of\
    \ time by\n   better engineering of, e.g., routing protocols, or we should develop\n\
    \   IPng now.  This question is not addressed in this document.\n   We would like\
    \ to gratefully acknowledge the assistance of literally\n   hundreds of people\
    \ who shared their views and insights with us.\n   However, this memo is solely\
    \ the personal opinion of the authors and\n   in no way represents, nor should\
    \ it be construed as representing, the\n   opinion of the ISOC, the IAB, the IRTF,\
    \ the IESG, the IETF, the\n   Internet community as a whole, nor the authors'\
    \ respective employers.\n"
- title: 2. Goals
  contents:
  - "2. Goals\n   We believe that by developing a list of criteria for evaluating\n\
    \   proposals for IP The Next Generation (IPng), the IETF will make it\n   easier\
    \ for developers of proposals to prioritize their work and\n   efforts and make\
    \ reasoned choices as to where they should spend\n   relatively more and less\
    \ time.  Furthermore, a list of criteria may\n   help the IETF community determine\
    \ which proposals are serious\n   contenders for a next generation IP, and which\
    \ proposals are\n   insufficient to the task.  Note that these criteria are probably\
    \ not\n   sufficient to make final decisions about which proposal is best.\n \
    \  Questions such as whether to trade a little performance (e.g.,\n   packets\
    \ per second routed) for slightly more functionality (e.g.,\n   more flexible\
    \ routing) cannot be easily addressed by a simple list of\n   criteria.  However,\
    \ at minimum, we believe that protocols that meet\n   these criteria are capable\
    \ of serving as the future IPng.\n   This set of criteria originally began as\
    \ an ordered list, with the\n   goal of ranking the importance of various criteria.\
    \  Eventually, the\n   layout evolved into the current form, where each criterion\
    \ was\n   presented without weighting, but a time frame, indicating\n   approximately\
    \ when a specific criterion, or feature of a criterion,\n   should be available\
    \ was added to the specification.\n   We have attempted to state the criteria\
    \ in the form of goals or\n   requirements and not demand specific engineering\
    \ solutions.  For\n   example, there has been talk in the community of making\
    \ route\n   aggregation a requirement.  We believe that route aggregation is not,\n\
    \   in and of itself, a requirement but rather one part of a solution to\n   the\
    \ real problem of scaling to some very large, complex topology.\n   Therefore,\
    \ route aggregation is NOT listed as a requirement; instead,\n   the more general\
    \ functional goal of having the routing scale is\n   listed instead of the particular\
    \ mechanism of route aggregation.\n   In determining the relative timing of the\
    \ various criteria, we have\n   had two guiding principles.  First, IPng must\
    \ offer an internetwork\n   service akin to that of IPv4, but improved to handle\
    \ the well-known\n   and widely-understood problems of scaling the Internet architecture\n\
    \   to more end-points and an ever increasing range of bandwidths.\n   Second,\
    \ it must be desirable for users and network managers to\n   upgrade their equipment\
    \ to support IPng.  At a minimum, this second\n   point implies that there must\
    \ be a straightforward way to transition\n   systems from IPv4 to IPng.  But it\
    \ also strongly suggests that IPng\n   should offer features that IPv4 does not;\
    \ new features provide a\n   motivation to deploy IPng more quickly.\n"
- title: 3. Note on Terminology
  contents:
  - "3. Note on Terminology\n   The existing proposals tend distinguish between end-point\n\
    \   identification of, e.g., individual hosts, and topological addresses\n   of\
    \ network attachment points.  In this memo we do not make that\n   distinction.\
    \ We use the term \"address\" as it is currently used in\n   IPv4; i.e., for both\
    \ the identification of a particular endpoint or\n   host AND as the topological\
    \ address of a point on the network. We\n   presume that if the endpoint/ address\
    \ split remains, the proposals\n   will make the proper distinctions with respect\
    \ to the criteria\n   enumerated below.\n"

- title: 4.1 Architectural Simplicity
  contents:
  - "4.1 Architectural Simplicity\n         In anything at all, perfection is finally\
    \ attained not\n         when there is no longer anything to add, but when there\n\
    \         is no longer anything to take away.\n                              \
    \            Antoine de Saint-Exupery\n   We believe that many communications\
    \ functions are more appropriately\n   performed at protocol layers other than\
    \ the IP layer.  We see\n   protocol stacks as hourglass-shaped, with IPng in\
    \ the middle, or\n   waist, of the hourglass.  As such, essentially all higher-layer\n\
    \   protocols make use of and rely upon IPng.  Similarly IPng, by virtue\n   of\
    \ its position in the \"protocol hourglass\" encompasses a wide\n   variety of\
    \ lower-layer protocols.  When IPng does not perform a\n   particular function\
    \ or provide a certain service, it should not get\n   in the way of the other\
    \ elements of the protocol stack which may well\n   wish to perform the function.\n"
- title: 4.2 One Protocol to Bind Them All
  contents:
  - "4.2 One Protocol to Bind Them All\n   One of the most important aspects of The\
    \ Internet is that it provides\n   global IP-layer connectivity. The IP layer\
    \ provides the point of\n   commonality among all of the nodes on the Internet.\
    \ In effect, the\n   main goal of the Internet is to provide an IP Connectivity\
    \ Service to\n   all who wish it.\n   This does NOT say that the Internet is a\
    \ One-Protocol Internet. The\n   Internet is today, and shall remain in the future,\
    \ a Multi-Protocol\n   Internet.  Multi-Protocol operations are required to allow\
    \ for\n   continued testing, experimentation, and development and because\n  \
    \ service providers' customers clearly want to be able to run protocols\n   such\
    \ as CLNP, DECNET, and Novell over their Internet connections.\n"
- title: 4.3 Live Long
  contents:
  - "4.3 Live Long\n   It is very difficult to change a protocol as central to the\
    \ workings\n   of the Internet as IP. Even more problematic is changing such a\n\
    \   protocol frequently.  This simply can not be done. We believe that it\n  \
    \ is impossible to expect the community to make significant, non-\n   backward\
    \ compatible changes to the IP layer more often than once\n   every 10-15 years.\
    \ In order to be conservative, we strongly urge\n   protocol developers to consider\
    \ what the Internet will look like in\n   20 years and design their protocols\
    \ to fit that vision.\n   As a data point, the SNMP community has had great difficulty\
    \ moving\n   from SNMPv1 to SNMPv2.  Frequent changes in software are hard.\n"
- title: 4.4 Live Long AND Prosper
  contents:
  - "4.4 Live Long AND Prosper\n   We believe that simply allowing for bigger addresses\
    \ and more\n   efficient routing is not enough of a benefit to encourage vendors,\n\
    \   service providers, and users to switch to IPng, with its attendant\n   disruptions\
    \ of service, etc.  These problems can be solved much more\n   simply with faster\
    \ routers, balkanization of the Internet address\n   space, and other hacks.\n\
    \   We believe that there must be positive functional or operational\n   benefits\
    \ to switching to IPng.\n   In other words, IPng must be able to live for a long\
    \ time AND it must\n   allow the Internet to prosper and to grow to serve new\
    \ applications\n   and user needs.\n"
- title: 4.5 Co-operative Anarchy
  contents:
  - "4.5 Co-operative Anarchy\n   A major contributor to the Internet's success is\
    \ the fact that there\n   is no single, centralized, point of control or promulgator\
    \ of policy\n   for the entire network.  This allows individual constituents of\
    \ the\n   network to tailor their own networks, environments, and policies to\n\
    \   suit their own needs.  The individual constituents must cooperate\n   only\
    \ to the degree necessary to ensure that they interoperate.\n   We believe that\
    \ this decentralized and decoupled nature of the\n   Internet must be preserved.\
    \  Only a minimum amount of centralization\n   or forced cooperation will be tolerated\
    \ by the community as a whole.\n   We also believe that there are some tangible\
    \ benefits to this\n   decoupled nature. For example,\n   * It is easier to experiment\
    \ with new protocols and services and then\n     roll out intermediate and final\
    \ results in a controlled fashion.\n   * By eliminating a single point of control,\
    \ a single point of failure\n     is also eliminated, making it much less likely\
    \ that the entire\n     network will fail.\n   * It allows the administrative\
    \ tasks for the network to be more\n     widely distributed.\n   An example of\
    \ the benefits of this \"Cooperative Anarchy\" can be seen\n   in the benefits\
    \ derived from using the Domain Naming System over the\n   original HOSTS.TXT\
    \ system.\n"
- title: 5. Criteria
  contents:
  - "5. Criteria\n   This section enumerates the criteria against which we suggest\
    \ the IP\n   The Next Generation proposals be evaluated.\n   Each criterion is\
    \ presented in its own section. The first paragraph\n   of each section is a short,\
    \ one or two sentence statement of the\n   criterion.  Additional paragraphs then\
    \ explain the criterion in more\n   detail, clarify what it does and does not\
    \ say and provide some\n   indication of its relative importance.\n   Also, each\
    \ criterion includes a subsection called \"Time Frame\".  This\n   is intended\
    \ to give a rough indication of when the authors believe\n   that the particular\
    \ criterion will become \"important\".  We believe\n   that if an element of technology\
    \ is significant enough to include in\n   this document then we probably understand\
    \ the technology enough to\n   predict how important that technology will be.\
    \  In general, these\n   time frames indicate that, within the desired time frame,\
    \ we should\n   be able to get an understanding of how the feature will be added\
    \ to a\n   protocol, perhaps after discussions with the engineers doing the\n\
    \   development.  Time Frame is not a deployment schedule since\n   deployment\
    \ schedules depend on non-technical issues, such as vendors\n   determining whether\
    \ a market exists, users fitting new releases into\n   their systems, and so on.\n"
- title: 5.1 Scale
  contents:
  - "5.1 Scale\n   CRITERION\n      The IPng Protocol must scale to allow the identification\
    \ and\n      addressing of at least 10**12 end systems (and preferably much\n\
    \      more).  The IPng Protocol, and its associated routing protocols\n     \
    \ and architecture must allow for at least 10**9 individual networks\n      (and\
    \ preferably more).  The routing schemes must scale at a rate\n      that is less\
    \ than the square root of the number of constituent\n      networks [10].\n  \
    \ DISCUSSION\n      The initial, motivating, purpose of the IPng effort is to\
    \ allow\n      the Internet to grow beyond the size constraints imposed by the\n\
    \      current IPv4 addressing and routing technologies.\n      Both aspects of\
    \ scaling are important.  If we can't route then\n      connecting all these hosts\
    \ is worthless, but without connected\n      hosts, there's no point in routing,\
    \ so we must scale in both\n      directions.\n      In any proposal, particular\
    \ attention must be paid to describing\n      the routing hierarchy, how the routing\
    \ and addressing will be\n      organized, how different layers of the routing\
    \ interact, and the\n      relationship between addressing and routing.\n    \
    \  Particular attention must be paid to describing what happens when\n      the\
    \ size of the network approaches these limits. How are network,\n      forwarding,\
    \ and routing performance affected? Does performance\n      fall off or does the\
    \ network simply stop as the limit is neared.\n      This criterion is the essential\
    \ problem motivating the transition\n      to IPng.  If the proposed protocol\
    \ does not satisfy this criteria,\n      there is no point in considering it.\n\
    \      We note that one of the white papers solicited for the IPng\n      process\
    \ [5] indicates that 10**12 end nodes is a reasonable\n      estimate based on\
    \ the expected number of homes in the world and\n      adding two orders of magnitude\
    \ for \"safety\".  However, this white\n      paper treats each home in the world\
    \ as an end-node of a world-wide\n      Internet.  We believe that each home in\
    \ the world will in fact be\n      a network of the world-wide Internet.  Therefore,\
    \ if we take [5]'s\n      derivation of 10**12 as accurate, and change their assumption\
    \ that\n      a home will be an end-node to a home being a network, we may\n \
    \     expect that there will be the need to support at least 10**12\n      networks,\
    \ with the possibility of supporting up to 10**15 end-\n      nodes.\n   Time\
    \ Frame\n      Any IPng proposal should be able to show immediately that it has\n\
    \      an architecture for the needed routing protocols, addressing\n      schemes,\
    \ abstraction techniques, algorithms, data structures, and\n      so on that can\
    \ support growth to the required scales.\n      Actual development, specification,\
    \ and deployment of the needed\n      protocols can be deferred until IPng deployment\
    \ has extended far\n      enough to require such protocols.  A proposed IPng should\
    \ be able\n      to demonstrate ahead of time that it can scale as needed.\n"
- title: 5.2 Topological Flexibility
  contents:
  - "5.2 Topological Flexibility\n   CRITERION\n      The routing architecture and\
    \ protocols of IPng must allow for many\n      different network topologies. \
    \ The routing architecture and\n      protocols must not assume that the network's\
    \ physical structure is\n      a tree.\n   DISCUSSION\n      As the Internet becomes\
    \ ever more global and ubiquitous, it will\n      develop new and different topologies.\
    \ We already see cases where\n      the network hierarchy is very \"broad\" with\
    \ many subnetworks, each\n      with only a few hosts and where it is very \"\
    narrow\", with few\n      subnetworks each with many hosts.  We can expect these\
    \ and other\n      topological forms in the future.  Furthermore, since we expect\n\
    \      that IPng will allow for many more levels of hierarchy than are\n     \
    \ allowed under IPv4, we can expect very \"tall\" and very \"short\"\n      topologies\
    \ as well.\n      Constituent organizations of the Internet should be allowed\
    \ to\n      structure their internal topologies in any manner they see fit.\n\
    \      Within reasonable implementation limits, organizations should be\n    \
    \  allowed to structure their addressing in any manner.  We\n      specifically\
    \ wish to point out that if the network's topology or\n      addressing is hierarchical,\
    \ constituent organizations should be\n      able to allocate to themselves as\
    \ many levels of hierarchy as they\n      wish.\n      It is very possible that\
    \ the diameter of the Internet will grow to\n      be extremely large; perhaps\
    \ larger than 256 hops.\n      Neither the current, nor the future, Internet will\
    \ be physically\n      structured as a tree, nor can we assume that connectivity\

    \      We note that Robust Service is, in some form, a part of security\n    \

    \      implementations, and misconfigurations must be localized as much\n    \
    \  as possible.  For example, misconfiguring a workstation's IP\n      Address\

    \ more failures in the network.  These failures may be\n      a combination of\
    \ simple size; if the size of the network goes up\n      by a factor of n, then\
    \ the total number of failures in the network\n      can be expected to increase\
    \ by some function of n.  Also, as the\n      network's users become less sophisticated,\
    \ it can be assumed that\n      they will make more, innocent and well meaning,\

    \      once. The size, complexity, and distributed administration of the\n   \
    \   Internet make such a cutover impossible.\n      Rather, IPng will need to\
    \ co-exist with IPv4 for some period of\n      time.  There are a number of ways\
    \ to achieve this co-existence\n      such as requiring hosts to support two stacks,\

    \      mechanisms to allow these hosts to communicate, even after IPng\n     \
    \ has become the dominant network layer protocol in the Internet.\n      The absence\
    \ of a rational and well-defined transition plan is not\n      acceptable.  Indeed,\
    \ the difficulty of running a network that is\n      transitioning from IPv4 to\

    \ internetwork of many different\n      LAN, MAN, and WAN media, with individual\
    \ link speeds ranging from\n      a ones-of-bits per second to hundreds of gigabits\
    \ per second.\n      Multiple-access and point-to-point media must be supported,\
    \ as\n      must media supporting both switched and permanent circuits.\n   DISCUSSION\n\
    \      The joy of IP is that it works over just about anything.  This\n      generality\
    \ must be preserved.  The ease of adding new\n      technologies, and ability\
    \ to continue operating with old\n      technologies must be maintained.\n   \
    \   We believe this range of speed is right for the next twenty years,\n     \
    \ though we may wish to require terabit performance at the high-end.\n      We\
    \ believe that, at a minimum, media running at 500 gigabits per\n      second\
    \ will be commonly available within 10 years.  The low end of\n      the link-speed\
    \ range is based on the speed of systems like pagers\n      and ELF (ELF connects\
    \ to submerged submarines and has a \"speed\" on\n      the order of <10 characters\
    \ per second).\n      By switched circuits we mean both \"permanent\" connections\
    \ such as\n      X.25 and Frame Relay services AND \"temporary\" types of dialup\n\
    \      connections similar to today's SLIP and dialup PPP services, and\n    \
    \  perhaps, ATM SVCs.  The latter form of connection implies that\n      dynamic\
    \ network access (i.e., the ability to unplug a machine,\n      move it to a different\
    \ point on the network topology, and plug it\n      back in, possibly with a changed\
    \ IPng address) is required. We\n      note that this is an aspect of mobility.\n\
    \      By work, we mean we have hopes that a stream of IPng datagrams\n      (whether\
    \ from one source, or many) can come close to filling the\n      link at high\
    \ speeds, but also scales gracefully to low speeds.\n      Many network media\
    \ are multi-protocol.  It is essential that IPng\n      be able to peacefully\
    \ co-exist on such media with other protocols.\n      Routers and hosts must be\
    \ able to discriminate among the protocols\n      that might be present on such\
    \ a medium.  For example, on an\n      Ethernet, a specific, IPng Ethernet Type\
    \ value might be called\n      for; or the old IPv4 Ethernet type is used and\
    \ the first four\n      (version number in the old IPv4 header) bits would distinguish\n\
    \      between IPv4 and IPng.\n      Different media have different MAC address\
    \ formats and schemes.\n      It must be possible for a node to dynamically determine\
    \ the MAC\n      address of a node given that node's IP address.  We explicitly\n\
    \      prohibit using static, manually configured mappings as the\n      standard\
    \ approach.\n      Another aspect of this criterion is that many different MTUs\
    \ will\n      be found in an IPng internetwork.  An IPng must be able to operate\n\
    \      in such a multi-MTU environment.  It must be able to adapt to the\n   \
    \   MTUs of the physical media over which it operates.  Two possible\n      techniques\
    \ for dealing with this are path MTU discovery and\n      fragmentation and reassembly;\
    \ other techniques might certainly be\n      developed.\n      We note that, as\
    \ of this writing (mid 1994), ATM seems to be set\n      to become a major network\
    \ media technology.  Any IPng should be\n      designed to operate over ATM. \
    \ However, IPng still must be able to\n      operate over other, more \"traditional\"\
    \ network media.\n      Furthermore, a host on an ATM network must be able to\
    \ interoperate\n      with a host on another, non-ATM, medium, with no more difficulty\n\
    \      or complexity than hosts on different media can interoperate today\n  \
    \    using IPv4.\n      IPng must be able to deal both with \"dumb\" media, such\
    \ as we have\n      today, and newer, more intelligent, media.  In particular,\
    \ IPng\n      functions must be able to exist harmoniously with lower-layer\n\
    \      realizations of the same, or similar, functions. Routing and\n      resource\
    \ management are two areas where designers should pay\n      particular attention.\
    \  Some subnetwork technologies may include\n      integral accounting and billing\
    \ capabilities, and IPng must\n      provide the correct control information to\
    \ such subnetworks.\n   Time Frame\n      Specifications for current media encapsulations\
    \ (i.e., all\n      encapsulations that are currently Proposed standards, or higher,\n\
    \      in the IETF) are required immediately.  These specifications must\n   \
    \   include any auxiliary protocols needed (such as an address\n      resolution\

    \ a host learns via\n      this mechanism would also allow the host to make a\
    \ rational\n      selection of which first-hop router to send any given packet\
    \ to.\n      IPng must not mandate that users or administrators manually\n   \
    \   configure first-hop routers into hosts.\n      Also, a strength of IPv4 has\
    \ been its ability to be used on\n      isolated subnets.  IPng hosts must be\

  contents:
  - "5.12 Multicast\n   CRITERION\n      The protocol must support both unicast and\
    \ multicast packet\n      transmission.  Part of the multicast capability is a\
    \ requirement\n      to be able to send to \"all IP hosts on a given subnetwork\"\
    .\n      Dynamic and automatic routing of multicasts is also required.\n   DISCUSSION\n\
    \      IPv4 has made heavy use of the ability to multicast requests to\n     \
    \ all IPv4 hosts on a subnet, especially for autoconfiguration.\n      This ability\
    \ must be retained in IPng.\n      Unfortunately, IPv4 currently uses the local\
    \ media broadcast\n      address to multicast to all IP hosts.  This behavior\
    \ is anti-\n      social in mixed-protocol networks and should be fixed in IPng.\n\
    \      There's no good reason for IPng to send to all hosts on a subnet\n    \
    \  when it only wishes to send to all IPng hosts.  The protocol must\n      make\
    \ allowances for media that do not support true multicasting.\n      In the past\
    \ few years, we have begun to deploy support for wide-\n      area multicast addressing\
    \ in the Internet, and it has proved\n      valuable.  This capability must not\
    \ be lost in the transition to\n      IPng.\n      The ability to restrict the\
    \ range of a multicast to specific\n      networks is also important.  Furthermore,\
    \ it must be possible to\n      \"selectively\" multicast packets. That is, it\
    \ must be possible to\n      send a multicast to a remote, specific portion or\
    \ area of the\n      Internet (such as a specific network or subnetwork) and then\
    \ have\n      that multicast limited to just that specific area.  Furthermore,\n\
    \      any given network or subnetwork should be capable of supporting\n     \
    \ 2**16 \"local\" multicast groups, i.e., groups that are not\n      propagated\
    \ to other networks.  See [8].\n      It should be noted that addressing -- specifically\
    \ the syntax and\n      semantics of addresses -- has a great impact on the scalability\
    \ of\n      the architecture.\n      Currently, large-scale multicasts are routed\
    \ manually through the\n      Internet.  While this is fine for experiments, a\
    \ \"production\"\n      system requires that multicast-routing be dynamic and\
    \ automatic.\n      Multicast groups must be able to be created and destroyed,\
    \ hosts\n      must be able to join and leave multicast groups and the network\n\
    \      routing infrastructure must be able to locate new multicast groups\n  \
    \    and destinations and route traffic to those destinations all\n      without\
    \ manual intervention.\n      Large, topologically dispersed, multicast groups\
    \ (with up to 10**6\n      participants) must be supported.  Some applications\

    \      packets are required immediately.  Dynamic routing of multicast\n     \
    \ packets must be available within 18 months.\n      We believe that Multicast\
    \ Addressing is vital to support future\n      applications such as remote conferencing.\

    \ evolution must be\n      achievable without requiring network-wide software\
    \ upgrades.  IPng\n      is expected to evolve over time. As it evolves, it must\
    \ be able to\n      allow different versions to coexist on the same network.\n\
    \   DISCUSSION\n      We do not today know all of the things that we will want\
    \ the\n      Internet to be able to do 10 years from now.  At the same time, it\n\
    \      is not reasonable to ask users to transition to a new protocol\n      with\

    \ that any extensions can be\n      incrementally deployed to only those systems\
    \ which desire to use\n      them. Systems upgraded in this fashion must still\
    \ be able to\n      communicate with systems which have not been so upgraded.\n\
    \      There are several aspects to extensibility:\n   5.13.1 Algorithms\n   \
    \      The algorithms used in processing IPng information should be\n        \
    \ decoupled from the protocol itself.  It should be possible to\n         change\
    \ these algorithms without necessarily requiring protocol,\n         datastructure,\
    \ or header changes.\n   5.13.2 Headers\n         The content of packet headers\
    \ should be extensible.  As more\n         features and functions are required\
    \ of IPng, it may be\n         necessary to add more information to the IPng headers.\
    \  We note\n         that for IPv4, the use of options has proven less than entirely\n\
    \         satisfactory since options have tended to be inefficient to\n      \
    \   process.\n   5.13.3 Data Structures\n         The fundamental data structures\
    \ of IPng should not be bound\n         with the other elements of the protocol.\
    \  E.g., things like\n         address formats should not be intimately tied with\
    \ the routing\n         and forwarding algorithms in the way that the IPv4 address\n\
    \         class mechanism was tied to IPv4 routing and forwarding.\n   5.13.4\
    \ Packets\n         It should be possible to add additional packet-types to IPng.\n\
    \         These could be for, _\be._\bg., new control and/or monitoring\n    \
    \     operations.\n      We note that, everything else being equal, having larger,\n\
    \      oversized, number spaces is preferable to having number spaces\n      that\
    \ are \"just large enough\".  Larger spaces afford more\n      flexibility on\
    \ the part of network designers and operators and\n      allow for further experimentation\
    \ on the part of the scientists,\n      engineers, and developers.  See [7].\n\

  - "5.15 Support for Mobility\n   CRITERION\n      The protocol must support mobile\
    \ hosts, networks and\n      internetworks.\n   DISCUSSION\n      Again, mobility\
    \ is becoming increasingly important.  Look at the\n      portables that everyone\
    \ is carrying.  Note the strength of the\n      Apple commercial showing someone\
    \ automatically connecting up her\n      Powerbook to her computer back in the\
    \ office.  There have been a\n      number of pilot projects showing ways to support\
    \ mobility in IPv4.\n      All have some drawbacks.  But like network service\
    \ grades, if we\n      can support mobility, IPng will have features that will\
    \ encourage\n      transition.\n      We use an encompassing definition of \"\
    mobility\" here.  Mobility\n      typically means one of two things to people:\
    \ 1) Hosts that\n      physically move and remain connected (via some wireless\
    \ datalink)\n      with sessions and transport-layer connections remaining 'open'\
    \ or\n      'active' and 2) Disconnecting a host from one spot in the network,\n\
    \      connecting it back in another arbitrary spot and continuing to\n      work.\
    \  Both forms are required.\n      Reference [6] discusses possible future use\
    \ of IP-based networks\n      in the US Navy's ships, planes, and shore installations.\
    \  Their\n      basic model is that each ship, plane and shore installation\n\
    \      represents at least one IP network.  The ship- and plane-based\n      networks,\
    \ obviously, are mobile as these craft move around the\n      world. Furthermore,\
    \ most, if not all, Naval surface combatants\n      carry some aircraft (at a\
    \ minimum, a helicopter or two). So, not\n      only must there be mobile networks\
    \ (the ships that move around),\n      but there must be mobile internetworks:\
    \ the ships carrying the\n      aircraft where each aircraft has its own network,\
    \ which is\n      connected to the ship's network and the whole thing is moving.\n\
    \      There is also the requirement for dynamic mobility; a plane might\n   \
    \   take off from aircraft carrier A and land on carrier B so it\n      obviously\
    \ would want to \"connect\" to B's network.  This situation\n      might be even\
    \ more complex since the plane might wish to retain\n      connectivity to its\
    \ \"home\" network; that is, the plane might\n      remain connected to the ship-borne\
    \ networks of both aircraft\n      carriers, A and B.\n      These requirements\
    \ are not limited to just the navy.  They apply\n      to the civilian and commercial\
    \ worlds as well.  For example, in\n      civil airliners, commercial cargo and\
    \ passenger ships, trains,\n      cars and so on.\n   Time Frame\n      The mobility\

  - "6.4 Network Management\n   Network Management properly is a task to be carried\
    \ out by additional\n   protocols and standards, such as SNMP and its MIBs.  We\
    \ believe that\n   network management, per se, is not an attribute of the IPng\
    \ protocol.\n   Furthermore, network management is viewed as a support, or service,\n\
    \   function. Network management should be developed to fit IPng and not\n   the\
    \ other way round.\n"

  - "6.5 Accounting\n   We believe that accounting, like network management, must\
    \ be designed\n   to fit the IPng protocol, and not the other way round.  Therefore,\n\
    \   accounting, in and of itself, is not a requirement of IPng.  However,\n  \
    \ there are some facets of the protocol that have been specified to\n   make accounting\
    \ easier, such as non-repudiation of origin under\n   security, and the unique\
    \ naming requirement for sorting datagrams\n   into classes.  Note that a parameter\
    \ of network service that IPng\n   must support is cost.\n"

  - "6.6 Routing\n   Routing is a very critical part of the Internet.  In fact, the\n\
    \   Internet Engineering Task Force has a separate Area which is\n   chartered\
    \ to deal only with routing issues.  This Area is separate\n   from the more general\
    \ Internet Area.\n   We see that routing is also a critical component of IPng.\
    \  There are\n   several criteria, such as Scaling, Addressing, and Network Services,\n\
    \   which are intimately entwined with routing.  In order to stress the\n   critical\
    \ nature and importance of routing, we have chosen to devote a\n   separate chapter\
    \ to specifically enumerating some of the requirements\n   and issues that IPng\
    \ routing must address.  All of these issues, we\n   believe, fall out of the\
    \ general criteria presented in the previous\n   chapter.\n   6.6.1 Scale\n  \
    \    First and foremost, the routing architecture must scale to support\n    \
    \  a very large Internet.  Current expectations are for an Internet\n      of\
    \ about 10**9 to 10**12 networks.  The routing architecture must\n      be able\
    \ to deal with networks of this size.  Furthermore, the\n      routing architecture\
    \ must be able to deal with this size without\n      requiring massive, global\
    \ databases and algorithms.  Such\n      databases or algorithms would, in effect,\
    \ be single points of\n      failure in the architecture (which is not robust),\
    \ and because of\n      the nature of Internet administration (cooperative anarchy),\
    \ it\n      would be impossible to maintain the needed consistency.\n   6.6.2\
    \ Policy\n      Networks (both transit and non-transit) must be able to set their\n\
    \      own policies for the types of traffic that they will admit.  The\n    \
    \  routing architecture must make these policies available to the\n      network\
    \ as a whole.  Furthermore, nodes must be able to select\n      routes for their\
    \ traffic based on the advertised policies.\n   6.6.3 QOS\n      A key element\
    \ of the network service criteria is that differing\n      applications wish to\
    \ acquire differing grades of network service.\n      It is essential that this\
    \ service information be propagated around\n      the network.\n   6.6.4 Feedback\n\
    \      As users select specific routes over which to send their traffic,\n   \
    \   they must be provided feedback from the routing architecture. This\n     \
    \ feedback should allow the user to determine whether the desired\n      routes\
    \ are actually available or not, whether the desired services\n      are being\
    \ provided, and so forth.\n      This would allow users to modify their service\
    \ requirements or\n      even change their routes, as needed.\n   6.6.5 Stability\n\
    \      With the addition of additional data into the routing system\n      (i.e.,\
    \ routes are based not only on connectivity, as in IPv4, but\n      also on policies,\
    \ service grades, and so on), the stability of the\n      routes may suffer. \
    \ We offer as evidence the early ARPANET which\n      experimented with load-based\
    \ routing. Routes would remain in flux,\n      changing from one saturated link,\
    \ to another, unused, link.\n      This must not be allowed to happen.  If anything,\
    \ routes should be\n      even more stable under IPng's routing architecture than\
    \ under the\n      current architecture.\n   6.6.6 Multicast\n      Multicast\
    \ will be more important in IPng than it is today in IPv4.\n      Multicast groups\
    \ may be very large and very distributed.\n      Membership in multicast groups\
    \ will be very dynamic.  The routing\n      architecture must be able to cope\
    \ with this.\n      Furthermore, the routing architecture must be able to build\n\
    \      multicast routes dynamically, based on factors such as group\n      membership,\
    \ member location, requested and available qualities of\n      service, and so\
    \ on.\n"
