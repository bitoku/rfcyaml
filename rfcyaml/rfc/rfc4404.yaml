    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

    (FCIP) Entity is fully\n   described in [RFC3821] from a functional point of view.
    \ A collection\n   of multiple instances of FCIP Entities and the corresponding
    FC\n   Entities, described in [FCBB2], within an SNMP Context is referred to\n
    \  as an FCIP device here.  This section describes FCIP from a\n   management
    point of view.\n        +------------------------------------------+\n        |

    \       +------------------------------------------+\n   The FCIP device provides
    an IP-based interconnection model for\n   interconnecting FC fabric elements.
    \ In this model, the FCIP devices\n   along with the IP network on which they
    are running provide a new\n   FCIP transport network.\n   This IP-based FCIP Interconnection
    Model supports the following\n   topology:\n   o The FCIP-based transport network
    is formed by interconnecting the\n     FCIP devices.\n   o Each FCIP device has
    one or more FCIP Entities or Instances.\n   o Peer FCIP Entities are connected
    by FCIP Links attached to\n     VE_ports/B_Access.\n   o Each FCIP Link Endpoint
    contains one or more Data Engines.\n   o The FCIP device can work as a stand-alone
    box or as part of a FC\n     fabric element.\n   Each FCIP Entity managed by this
    MIB is referred to as an FCIP\n   Instance.  The MIB is broken up as follows:\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  FCIP Entity Instances Table\n   The FCIP Entity table contains information
      about this entity's\n   existing instances of FCIP entities.\n"
    title: 2.1.  FCIP Entity Instances Table
  - contents:
    - "2.2.  FCIP Link Table\n   The FCIP link table contains information about this
      FCIP device's\n   existing FCIP links.\n"
    title: 2.2.  FCIP Link Table
  - contents:
    - "2.3.  FCIP TCP Connection Table\n   The FCIP TCP Connection table contains
      information about existing TCP\n   connections.  Each FCIP link within an FCIP
      entity contains one or\n   more TCP connections.  The FCIP entity employs a
      Data Engine for each\n   TCP connection for handling FC frame encapsulation,
      de-encapsulation,\n   and transmission of FCIP frames on the connection.\n"
    title: 2.3.  FCIP TCP Connection Table
  - contents:
    - "2.4.  FCIP Dynamic Route Table\n   The FCIP dynamic route table contains routing
      information that is\n   dynamically discovered by this FCIP device.  The FCIP
      device may use\n   the SLPv2 protocol [RFC3822] in conjunction with other protocols,\n
      \  such as Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF), to dynamically discover\n   other
      FCIP entities and populate this table to map destination\n   domains to FCIP
      Links.\n"
    title: 2.4.  FCIP Dynamic Route Table
  - contents:
    - "2.5.  FCIP Static Route Table\n   The FCIP static route table contains routing
      information that is\n   statically configured into this FCIP device by the Network
      Admin.  In\n   the absence of dynamic discovery of remote FCIP entities, the
      Network\n   Manager can configure remote domains and FCIP Entities that are\n
      \  reachable by this device into this table.\n   At any point in time, both
      the static and dynamic routing tables can\n   be active.  If a DID is present
      in both tables, information in the\n   static route table will take precedence
      over the entry in the dynamic\n   route table for the same DID.\n"

    applicable to FCIP devices\n   have not been included in this MIB module.  The
    following subsections\n   list all applicable MIB modules that should be present
    with FCIP-\n   MGMT-MIB.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Relationship to the 'TCP' Group\n   This group is mandatory for all systems
      that implement TCP.  Objects\n   relevant to TCP must be obtained from this
      group [RFC4022].\n"
    title: 3.1.  Relationship to the 'TCP' Group
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Relationship to the 'interfaces' MIB\n   The 'interfaces' group is defined
      as being mandatory for all systems\n   and contains information on an entity's
      interfaces.  Each\n   logical/virtual interface created as an FCIP Link should
      be\n   represented as a row in the ifTable with a unique ifIndex value and a\n
      \  value of ifType 'fcipLink' (224) for each such interface.  For a\n   complete
      list of interface types, refer to the IANA registry at\n   \"http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers\".
      \ These are the only\n   ifIndex values of relevance to an FCIP Entity because
      FCIP runs on\n   top of TCP/IP.\n   FCIP runs over TCP.  Thus, by definition,
      there is no ifTable\n   interface directly beneath it, and so ifStackLowerLayer
      is always 0.\n   For any protocol using FCIP (i.e., above FCIP), FCIP appears
      to be a\n   regular FC interface.  As stated in [RFC4044], a regular \"FC\n
      \  interface will typically have no other ifTable rows stacked on top of\n   it\",
      and thus, ifStackHigherLayer is typically zero.\n"

      Management MIB [RFC4044] is assumed for FC\n   functionality managed objects.\n"

  title: 4.  MIB Definitions
- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ In particular, write access to\n   fcipDiscoveryDomainName and fcipEntityAddress
    can cause a loss of\n   reachability to portions of the Fibre Channel fabric,
    while write\n   access to fcipStaticRouteStatus can create incorrect routes to
    remote\n   devices.\n   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that
    contain what\n   could be considered as sensitive information.  In particular,
    the\n   objects which provide information on identification and network\n   topology:\n
    \  fcipDeviceWWN, fcipEntityName, fcipEntityAddress,\n   fcipLinkLocalFcipEntityAddress,
    fcipLinkRemFcipEntityWWN,\n   and fcipLinkRemFcipEntityAddress\n   -- information
    on identification;\n   fcipDiscoveryDomainName\n   -- information on discovery
    domains;\n   fcipDynamicRouteLinkIndex\n   -- information on dynamic routes;\n
    \  fcipStaticRouteLinkIndex and fcipStaticRouteStatus\n   -- information on static
    routes\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n
    \  Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even
    then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access
    and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n
    \  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as\n   provided
    by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support
    for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n
    \  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.
    \ Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic
    security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to ensure that the
    SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module is properly configured
    to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n
    \  rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
