  - "Abstract\n   The goals of the work to \"internationalize\" Internet protocols\n\
    \   include providing all users of the Internet with the capability of\n   using\
    \ their own language and its standard character set to express\n   themselves,\
    \ write names, and to navigate the network. This impacts\n   the domain names\
    \ visible in e-mail addresses and so many of today's\n   URLs used to locate information\
    \ on the World Wide Web, etc.  However,\n   domain names are used by Internet\
    \ protocols that are used across\n   national boundaries. These services must\
    \ interoperate worldwide, or\n   we risk isolating components of the network from\
    \ each other along\n   locale boundaries.  This type of isolation could impede\
    \ not only\n   communications among people, but opportunities of the areas involved\n\
    \   to participate effectively in e-commerce, distance learning, and\n   other\
    \ activities at an international scale, thereby retarding\n   economic development.\n\
    \   There are several proposals for internationalizing domain names,\n   however\
    \ it it is still to be determined whether any of them will\n   ensure this interoperability\
    \ and global reach while addressing\n   visible-name representation.  Some of\
    \ them obviously do not. This\n   document does not attempt to review any specific\
    \ proposals, as that\n   is the work of the Internationalized Domain Name (IDN)\
    \ Working Group\n   of the IETF, which is tasked with evaluating them in consideration\
    \ of\n   the continued global network interoperation that is the deserved\n  \
    \ expectation of all Internet users.\n   This document is a statement by the Internet\
    \ Architecture Board. It\n   is not a protocol specification, but an attempt to\
    \ clarify the range\n   of architectural issues that the internationalization\
    \ of domain names\n   faces.\n"

  - "1. A Definition of Success\n   The Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) Working\
    \ Group is one\n   component of the IETF's continuing comprehensive effort to\n\
    \   internationalize language representation facilities in the protocols\n   that\
    \ support the global functioning of the Internet.\n   In keeping with the principles\
    \ of rough consensus, running code,\n   architectural integrity, and in the interest\
    \ of ensuring the global\n   stability of the Internet, the IAB emphasizes that\
    \ all solutions\n   proposed to the (IDN) Working Group will have to be evaluated\
    \ not\n   only on their individual technical features, but also in terms of\n\
    \   impact on existing standards and operations of the Internet and the\n   total\
    \ effect for end-users: solutions must not cause users to become\n   more isolated\
    \ from their global neighbors even if they appear to\n   solve a local problem.\
    \  In some cases, existing protocols have\n   limitations on allowable characters,\
    \ and in other cases\n   implementations of protocols used in the core of the\
    \ Internet (beyond\n   individual organizations) have in practice not implemented\
    \ all the\n   requisite options of the standards.\n"

  - "2. Technical Challenges within the Domain Name System (DNS)\n   In many technical\
    \ respects, the IDN work is not different from any\n   other effort to enable\
    \ multiple character set representations in\n   textual elements that were traditionally\
    \ restricted to English\n   language characters.\n   One aspect of the challenge\
    \ is to decide how to represent the names\n   users want in the DNS in a way that\
    \ is clear, technically feasible,\n   and ensures that a name always means the\
    \ same thing.  Several\n   proposals have been suggested to address these issues.\n\
    \   These issues are being outlined in more detail in the IDN WG's\n   evolving\
    \ draft requirements document; further discussion is deferred\n   to the WG and\
    \ its documents.\n"

  - "3. Integrating with Current Realities\n   Nevertheless, issues faced by the IDN\
    \ working group are complex and\n   intricately intertwined with other operational\
    \ components of the\n   Internet.  A key challenge in evaluating any proposed\
    \ solution is the\n   analysis of the impact on existing critical operational\
    \ standards\n   which use fully-qualified domain names [RFC1034], or simply host\n\
    \   names [RFC1123].  Standards-changes can be effected, but the best\n   path\
    \ forward is one that takes into account current realities and\n   (re)deployment\
    \ latencies. In the Internet's global context, it is not\n   enough to update\
    \ a few isolated systems, or even most of the systems\n   in a country or region.\
    \  Deployment must be nearly universal in order\n   to avoid the creation of \"\
    islands\" of interoperation that provide\n   users with less access to and connection\
    \ from the rest of the world.\n   These are not esoteric or ephemeral concerns.\
    \  Some specific issues\n   have already been identified as part of the IDN WG's\
    \ efforts.  These\n   include (but are not limited to) the following examples.\n"
- title: 3.1 Domain Names and E-mail
  contents:
  - "3.1 Domain Names and E-mail\n   As indicated in the IDN WG's draft requirements\
    \ document, the issue\n   goes beyond standardization of DNS usage.  Electronic\
    \ mail has long\n   been one of the most-used and most important applications\
    \ of the\n   Internet.  Internet e-mail is also used as the bridge that permits\n\
    \   the users of a variety of local and proprietary mail systems to\n   communicate.\
    \ The standard protocols that define its use (e.g., SMTP\n   [RFC821, RFC822]\
    \ and MIME [RFC2045]) do not permit the full range of\n   characters allowed in\
    \ the DNS specification. Certain characters are\n   not allowed in e-mail address\
    \ domain portions of these\n   specifications.  Some mailers, built to adhere\
    \ to these\n   specifications, are known to fail when on mail having non-ASCII\n\
    \   domain names in its address -- by discarding, misrouting or damaging\n   the\
    \ mail.  Thus, it's not possible to simply switch to\n   internationalized domain\
    \ names and expect global e-mail to continue\n   to work until most of the servers\
    \ in the world are upgraded.\n"
- title: 3.2 Domain Names and Routing
  contents:
  - "3.2 Domain Names and Routing\n   At a lower level, the Routing Policy Specification\
    \ Language (RPLS)\n   [RFC2622] makes use of \"named objects\" -- and inherits\
    \ object naming\n   restrictions from older standards ([RFC822] for the same e-mail\n\
    \   address restrictions, [RFC1034] for hostnames).  This means that\n   until\
    \ routing registries and their protocols are updated, it is not\n   possible to\
    \ enter or retrieve network descriptions utilizing\n   internationalized domain\
    \ names.\n"
- title: 3.3 Domain Names and Network Management
  contents:
  - "3.3 Domain Names and Network Management\n   Also, the Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol (SNMP) uses the textual\n   representation defined in [RFC2579].  While\
    \ that specification does\n   allow for UTF-8-based domain names, an informal\
    \ survey of deployed\n   implementations of software libraries being used to build\
    \ SNMP-\n   compliant software uncovered the fact that few (if any) implement\
    \ it.\n   This may cause inability to enter or display correct data in network\n\
    \   management tools, if such names are internationalized domain names.\n"
- title: 3.4 Domain Names and Security
  contents:
  - "3.4 Domain Names and Security\n   Critical components of Internet public key\
    \ technologies (PKIX,\n   [RFC2459], IKE [RFC2409]) rely heavily on identification\
    \ of servers\n   (hostnames, or fully qualified domain names) and users (e-mail\n\
    \   addresses).  Failure to respect the character restrictions in these\n   protocols\
    \ will impact security tools built to use them -- Transport\n   Layer Security\
    \ protocol (TLS, [RFC2246]), and IPsec [RFC2401] to name\n   two.\n   Failure\
    \ may not be obvious.  For example, in TLS, it is common usage\n   for a server\
    \ to display a certificate containing a domain name\n   purporting to be the domain\
    \ name of the server, which the client can\n   then match with the server name\
    \ he thought he used to reach the\n   service.\n   Unless comparison of domain\
    \ names is properly defined, the client may\n   either fail to match the domain\
    \ name of a legitimate server, or match\n   incorrectly the domain name of a server\
    \ performing a man-in-the-\n   middle attack.  Either failure could enable attacks\
    \ on systems that\n   are now impossible or at least far more difficult.\n"
- title: 4. Conclusion
  contents:
  - "4. Conclusion\n   It is therefore clear that, although there are many possible\
    \ ways to\n   assign internationalized names that are compatible with today's\
    \ DNS\n   (or a version that is easily-deployable in the near future), not all\n\
    \   of them are compatible with the full range of necessary networking\n   tools.\
    \  When designing a solution for internationalization of domain\n   names, the\
    \ effects on the current Internet must be carefully\n   evaluated. Some types\
    \ of solutions proposed would, if put into effect\n   immediately, cause Internet\
    \ communications to fail in ways that would\n   be hard to detect by and pose\
    \ problems for those who deploy the new\n   services, but also for those who do\
    \ not; this would have the effect\n   of cutting those who deploy them off from\
    \ effective use of the\n   Internet.\n   The IDN WG has been identified as the\
    \ appropriate forum for\n   identifying and discussing solutions for such potential\n\
    \   interoperability issues.\n   Experience with deployment of other protocols\
    \ has indicated that it\n   will take years before a new protocol or enhancement\
    \ is used all over\n   the Internet.  So far, the IDN WG has benefited from proposed\n\
    \   solutions from all quarters, including organizations hoping to\n   provide\
    \ services that address visible-name representation and\n   registration -- continuing\
    \ this process with the aim of getting a\n   single, scalable and deployable solution\
    \ to this problem is the only\n   way to ensure the continued global interoperation\
    \ that is the\n   deserved expectation of all Internet users.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   In general, assignment and use of names does not\
    \ raise any special\n   security problems.  However, as noted above, some existing\
    \ security\n   mechanisms are reliant on the current specification of domain names\n\
    \   and may not be expected to work, as is, with Internationalized domain\n  \
    \ names.  Additionally, deployment of non-standard systems (e.g., in\n   response\
    \ to current pressures to address national or regional\n   characterset representation)\
    \ might result in name strings that are\n   not globally unique, thereby opening\
    \ up the possibility of \"spoofing\"\n   hosts from one domain in another, as\
    \ described in [RFC2826].\n"
