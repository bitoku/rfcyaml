  - "Abstract\n   This document describes conventions whereby the system identifier\n\
    \   portion of an RFC 1237 style NSAP address may be guaranteed\n   uniqueness\
    \ within a routing domain for the purpose of\n   autoconfiguration in TUBA/CLNP\
    \ internets. The mechanism is extensible\n   and can provide a basis for assigning\
    \ system identifiers in a\n   globally unique fashion.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This memo specifies methods for assigning a 6 octet system identifier\n\
    \   portion of the OSI NSAP address formats described in \"Guidelines for\n  \
    \ OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet\" [1], in a fashion that ensures\n   that\
    \ the ID is unique within a routing domain. It also recommends\n   methods for\
    \ assigning system identifiers having lengths other than 6\n   octets. The 6 octet\
    \ system identifiers recommended in this RFC are\n   assigned from 2 globally\
    \ administered spaces (IEEE 802 or \"Ethernet\",\n   and IP numbers, administered\
    \ by the Internet Assigned Numbers\n   Authority, IANA).\n   At this time, the\
    \ primary purpose for assuring uniqueness of system\n   identifiers is to aid\
    \ in autoconfiguration of NSAP addresses in\n   TUBA/CLNP internets [2]. The guidelines\
    \ in this paper also establish\n   an initial framework within which globally\
    \ unique system identifiers,\n   also called endpoint identifiers, may be assigned.\n"

    \ the ID and SEL fields\n   shown in Figure 1 to take full advantage of intradomain\

- title: 2.  Autoconfiguration
  contents:
  - "2.  Autoconfiguration\n   There are provisions in OSI for the autoconfiguration\
    \ of area\n   addresses. OSI end systems may learn their area addresses\n   automatically\
    \ by observing area address identified in the IS-Hello\n   packets transmitted\
    \ by routers using the ISO 9542 End System to\n   Intermediate System Routing\
    \ Protocol, and may then insert their own\n   system identifier. (In particular,\
    \ RFC 1237 explains that when the ID\n   portion of the address is assigned using\
    \ IEEE style 48-bit\n   identifiers, an end system can reconfigure its entire\
    \ NSAP address\n   automatically without the need for manual intervention.) End\
    \ systems\n   that have not been pre-configured with an NSAPA may also request\
    \ an\n   address from an intermediate system their area using [5].\n"
- title: 2.1  Autoconfiguration and 48-bit addresses
  contents:
  - "2.1  Autoconfiguration and 48-bit addresses\n   There is a general misassumption\
    \ that the 6-octet system identifier\n   must be a 48-bit IEEE assigned (ethernet)\
    \ address.  Generally\n   speaking, autoconfiguration does not rely on the use\
    \ of a 48-bit\n   ethernet style address; any system identifier that is globally\n\
    \   administered and is unique will do. The use of 48-bit/6 octet system\n   identifiers\
    \ is \"convenient...because it is the same length as an 802\n   address\", but\
    \ more importantly, choice of a single, uniform ID length\n   allows for \"efficient\
    \ packet forwarding\", since routers won't have to\n   make on the fly decisions\
    \ about ID length (see [6], pages 156-157).\n   Still, it is not a requirement\
    \ that system identifiers be 6 octets to\n   operate the the IS-IS protocol, and\
    \ IS-IS allows for the use of IDs\n   with lengths from 1 to 8 octets.\n"
- title: 3.  System Identifiers for TUBA/CLNP
  contents:
  - "3.  System Identifiers for TUBA/CLNP\n   Autoconfiguration is a desirable feature\
    \ for TUBA/CLNP, and is viewed\n   by some as \"essential if a network is to scale\
    \ to a truly large size\"\n   [6].\n   For this purpose, and to accommodate communities\
    \ who do not wish to\n   use ethernet style addresses, a generalized format that\
    \ satisfies the\n   following criteria is desired:\n   o the format is compatible\
    \ with installed end systems\n     complying to RFC 1237\n   o the format accommodates\
    \ 6 octet, globally unique system\n     identifiers that do not come from the\
    \ ethernet address space\n   o the format accommodates globally unique system\
    \ identifiers\n     having lengths other than 6 octets\n   The format and encoding\
    \ of a globally unique system identifier that\n   meets these requirements is\
    \ illustrated in Figure 3:\n      Octet 1     Octet 2     Octet 3 ...     Octet\

- title: 3.1  IEEE 802 Form of System Identifier
  contents:
  - "3.1  IEEE 802 Form of System Identifier\n   The format is compatible with globally\
    \ assigned IEEE 802 addresses,\n   since it carefully preserves the semantics\
    \ of the global/local and\n   group/individual bits.  Octet 1 identifies 2 qualifier\
    \ bits, G and M,\n   and a subtype (TT) field whose semantics are associated with\
    \ the\n   qualifier bits.  When a globally assigned IEEE 802 address is used as\n\
    \   a system identifier, the qualifier bit M, representing the\n   multicast/unicast\
    \ bit, must always be set to zero to denote a unicast\n   address. The qualifier\
    \ bit G may be either 0 or 1, depending on\n   whether the individual address\
    \ is globally or locally assigned.  In\n   these circumstances, the subtype bits\
    \ are \"don't care\", and the\n   system identifier shall be interpreted as a\
    \ 48-bit, globally unique\n   identifier assigned from the IEEE 802 committee\
    \ (an ethernet\n   address).  The remaining bits in octet 1, together with octets\
    \ 2 and\n   3 are the vendor code or OUI (organizationally unique identifier),\
    \ as\n   illustrated in Figure 4.  The ID is encoded in IEEE 802 canonical\n \
    \  form (low order bit of low order hex digit of leftmost octet is the\n   first\
    \ bit transmitted).\n   Octet 1     Octet 2     Octet 3     Octet 4     Octet\

  contents:
  - "4.  Embedded IP Address as System Identifier\n   To distinguish 48-bit IEEE 802\
    \ addresses used as system identifiers\n   from other forms of globally admininistered\
    \ system identifiers, the\n   qualifer bit M shall be set to 1. The correct interpretation\
    \ of the M\n   bit set to 1 should be, \"this can't be an IEEE 802 multicast address,\n\
    \   since use of multicast addresses is by convention illegal, so it must\n  \
    \ be some other form of system identifier\". The subtype (TT) bits\n   illustrated\
    \ in Figure 3 thus become relevant.\n   When the subtype bits (TT) are set to\
    \ a value of 0, the system\n   identifier contains an embedded IP address. The\
    \ remainder of the 48-\n   bit system identifier is encoded as follows. The remaining\
    \ nibble in\n   octet 1 shall be set to zero.  Octet 2 is reserved and shall be\
    \ set\n   to a pre-assigned value (see Figure 5).  Octets 3 through 6 shall\n\
    \   contain a valid IP address, assigned by IANA.  Each octet of the IP\n   address\
