  - "Remembrance\n   A long time ago, in a network, far far away, a great adventure\
    \ took\n   place!\n   Out of the chaos of new ideas for communication, the experiments,\
    \ the\n   tentative designs, and crucible of testing, there emerged a\n   cornucopia\
    \ of networks.  Beginning with the ARPANET, an endless\n   stream of networks\
    \ evolved, and ultimately were interlinked to become\n   the Internet.  Someone\
    \ had to keep track of all the protocols, the\n   identifiers, networks and addresses\
    \ and ultimately the names of all\n   the things in the networked universe.  And\
    \ someone had to keep track\n   of all the information that erupted with volcanic\
    \ force from the\n   intensity of the debates and discussions and endless invention\
    \ that\n   has continued unabated for 30 years.  That someone was Jonathan B.\n\
    \   Postel, our Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, friend, engineer,\n   confidant,\
    \ leader, icon, and now, first of the giants to depart from\n   our midst.\n \
    \  Jon, our beloved IANA, is gone.  Even as I write these words I cannot\n   quite\
    \ grasp this stark fact.  We had almost lost him once before in\n   1991.  Surely\
    \ we knew he was at risk as are we all.  But he had been\n   our rock, the foundation\
    \ on which our every web search and email was\n   built, always there to mediate\
    \ the random dispute, to remind us when\n   our documentation did not do justice\
    \ to its subject, to make\n   difficult decisions with apparent ease, and to consult\
    \ when careful\n   consideration was needed.  We will survive our loss and we\
    \ will\n   remember.  He has left a monumental legacy for all Internauts to\n\
    \   contemplate.  Steadfast service for decades, moving when others\n   seemed\
    \ paralyzed, always finding the right course in a complex\n   minefield of technical\
    \ and sometimes political obstacles.\n   Jon and I went to the same high school,\
    \ Van Nuys High, in the San\n   Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles.  But we\
    \ were in different\n   classes and I really didn't know him then.  Our real meeting\
    \ came at\n   UCLA when we became a part of a group of graduate students working\n\
    \   for Professor Leonard Kleinrock on the ARPANET project.  Steve\n   Crocker\
    \ was another of the Van Nuys crowd who was part of the team\n   and led the development\
    \ of the first host-host protocols for the\n   ARPANET.  When Steve invented the\
    \ idea of the Request for Comments\n   series, Jon became the instant editor.\
    \  When we needed to keep track\n   of all the hosts and protocol identifiers,\
    \ Jon volunteered to be the\n   Numbers Czar and later the IANA once the Internet\
    \ was in place.\n   Jon was a founding member of the Internet Architecture Board\
    \ and\n   served continuously from its founding to the present.  He was the\n\
    \   FIRST individual member of the Internet Society I know, because he\n   and\
    \ Steve Wolff raced to see who could fill out the application forms\n   and make\
    \ payment first and Jon won.  He served as a trustee of the\n   Internet Society.\
    \  He was the custodian of the .US domain, a founder\n   of the Los Nettos Internet\
    \ service, and, by the way, managed the\n   networking research division of USC\
    \ Information Sciences Institute.\n   Jon loved the outdoors.  I know he used\
    \ to enjoy backpacking in the\n   high Sierras around Yosemite.  Bearded and sandaled,\
    \ Jon was our\n   resident hippie-patriarch at UCLA.  He was a private person\
    \ but fully\n   capable of engaging photon torpedoes and going to battle stations\
    \ in\n   a good engineering argument.  And he could be stubborn beyond all\n \
    \  expectation.  He could have outwaited the Sphinx in a staring\n   contest,\
    \ I think.\n   Jon inspired loyalty and steadfast devotion among his friends and\
    \ his\n   colleagues.  For me, he personified the words \"selfless service\".\n\
    \   For nearly 30 years, Jon has served us all, taken little in return,\n   indeed\
    \ sometimes receiving abuse when he should have received our\n   deepest appreciation.\
    \  It was particularly gratifying at the last\n   Internet Society meeting in\
    \ Geneva to see Jon receive the Silver\n   Medal of the International Telecommunications\
    \ Union.  It is an award\n   generally reserved for Heads of State, but I can\
    \ think of no one more\n   deserving of global recognition for his contributions.\n\
    \   While it seems almost impossible to avoid feeling an enormous sense\n   of\
    \ loss, as if a yawning gap in our networked universe had opened up\n   and swallowed\
    \ our friend, I must tell you that I am comforted as I\n   contemplate what Jon\
    \ has wrought.  He leaves a legacy of edited\n   documents that tell our collective\
    \ Internet story, including not only\n   the technical but also the poetic and\
    \ whimsical as well.  He\n   completed the incorporation of a successor to his\
    \ service as IANA and\n   leaves a lasting legacy of service to the community\
    \ in that role.\n   His memory is rich and vibrant and will not fade from our\
    \ collective\n   consciousness.  \"What would Jon have done?\", we will think,\
    \ as we\n   wrestle in the days ahead with the problems Jon kept so well tamed\n\
    \   for so many years.\n   There will almost surely be many memorials to Jon's\
    \ monumental\n   service to the Internet Community.  As current chairman of the\n\
    \   Internet Society, I pledge to establish an award in Jon's name to\n   recognize\
    \ long-standing service to the community, the Jonathan B.\n   Postel Service Award,\
    \ which will be awarded to Jon posthumously as\n   its first recipient.\n   If\
    \ Jon were here, I am sure he would urge us not to mourn his passing\n   but to\
    \ celebrate his life and his contributions.  He would remind us\n   that there\
    \ is still much work to be done and that we now have the\n   responsibility and\
    \ the opportunity to do our part.  I doubt that\n   anyone could possibly duplicate\
    \ his record, but it stands as a\n   measure of one man's astonishing contribution\
    \ to a community he knew\n   and loved.\n"
