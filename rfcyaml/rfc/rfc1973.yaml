  title: Status of this Memo
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method
    for\n   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.\n   This
    document describes the use of Frame Relay for framing PPP\n   encapsulated packets.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "Applicability\n   This specification is intended for those implementations which
    desire\n   to use facilities which are defined for PPP, such as the Link Control\n
    \  Protocol, Network-layer Control Protocols, authentication, and\n   compression.
    \ These capabilities require a point-to-point\n   relationship between peers,
    and are not designed for multi-point or\n   multi-access environments.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Frame Relay [2] is a relative newcomer to the serial link
    community.\n   Like X.25, the protocol was designed to provide virtual circuits
    for\n   connections between stations attached to the same Frame Relay\n   network.
    \ The improvement over X.25 is that Q.922 is restricted to\n   delivery of packets,
    and dispenses with sequencing and flow control,\n   simplifying the service immensely.\n
    \  PPP uses ISO 3309 HDLC as a basis for its framing [3].\n   When Frame Relay
    is configured as a point-to-point circuit, PPP can\n   use Frame Relay as a framing
    mechanism, ignoring its other features.\n   This is equivalent to the technique
    used to carry SNAP headers over\n   Frame Relay [4].\n   At one time, it had been
    hoped that PPP in HDLC-like frames and Frame\n   Relay would co-exist on the same
    links.  Unfortunately, the Q.922\n   method for expanding the address from 1 to
    2 to 4 octets is not\n   indistinguishable from the ISO 3309 method, due to the
    structure of\n   its Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI) subfields.  Co-existance\n
    \  is precluded.\n"

  - "2.  Physical Layer Requirements\n   PPP treats Frame Relay framing as a bit-synchronous
    link.  The link\n   MUST be full-duplex, but MAY be either dedicated (permanent)
    or\n   switched.\n   Interface Format\n      PPP presents an octet interface to
    the physical layer.  There is\n      no provision for sub-octets to be supplied
    or accepted.\n   Transmission Rate\n      PPP does not impose any restrictions
    regarding transmission rate,\n      other than that of the particular Frame Relay
    interface.\n   Control Signals\n      Implementation of Frame Relay requires the
    provision of control\n      signals, which indicate when the link has become connected
    or\n      disconnected.  These in turn provide the Up and Down events to the\n
    \     LCP state machine.\n      Because PPP does not normally require the use
    of control signals,\n      the failure of such signals MUST NOT affect correct
    operation of\n      PPP.  Implications are discussed in [2].\n   Encoding\n      The
    definition of various encodings is the responsibility of the\n      DTE/DCE equipment
    in use, and is outside the scope of this\n      specification.\n      While PPP
    will operate without regard to the underlying\n      representation of the bit
    stream, Frame Relay requires NRZ\n      encoding.\n"

    \  standardized in [4].  Instead, this document attempts to give a\n   concise

    - "3.2.  Modification of the Basic Frame\n   The Link Control Protocol can negotiate
      modifications to the basic\n   frame structure.  However, modified frames will
      always be clearly\n   distinguishable from standard frames.\n   Address-and-Control-Field-Compression\n
      \     Because the Address and Control field values are not constant, and\n      are
      modified as the frame is transported by the network switching\n      fabric,
      Address-and-Control-Field-Compression MUST NOT be\n      negotiated.\n   Protocol-Field-Compression\n
      \     Note that unlike PPP in HDLC-like framing, the Frame Relay framing\n      does
      not align the Information field on a 32-bit boundary.\n      Alignment to a
      32-bit boundary occurs when the NLPID is removed\n      and the Protocol field
      is compressed to a single octet.  When this\n      improves throughput, Protocol-Field-Compression
      SHOULD be\n      negotiated.\n"

  - "4.  In-Band Protocol Demultiplexing\n   The PPP NLPID (CF hex) and PPP Protocol
    fields easily distinguish the\n   PPP encapsulation from the other NLPID encapsulations
    described in\n   [4].\n   The joining of the PPP and NLPID number space has an
    added advantage,\n   in that the LCP Protocol-Reject can be used to indicate NLPIDs
    that\n   are not recognized.  This can eliminate \"black-holes\" that occur when\n
    \  traffic is not supported.\n   For those network-layer protocols which have
    no PPP Protocol\n   assignment, or which have not yet been implemented under the
    PPP\n   encapsulation, or which have not been successfully negotiated by a\n   PPP
    NCP, another method of encapsulation defined under [4] SHOULD be\n   used.\n   Currently,
    there are no conflicts between NLPID and PPP Protocol\n   values.  If a future
    implementation is configured to send a NLPID\n   value which is the same as a
    compressed Protocol field, that Protocol\n   field MUST NOT be sent compressed.\n
    \  On reception, the first octet following the header is examined.  If\n   the
    octet is zero, it MUST be assumed that the packet is formatted\n   according to
    [4].\n   PPP encapsulated packets always have a non-zero octet following the\n
    \  header.  If the octet is not the PPP NLPID value (CF hex), and\n   Protocol-Field-Compression
    is enabled, and the associated NCP has\n   been negotiated, then it is expected
    to be a compressed PPP Protocol\n   value.  Otherwise, it MUST be assumed that
    the packet is formatted\n   according to [4].\n   The Protocol field value 0x00cf
    is not allowed (reserved) to avoid\n   ambiguity when Protocol-Field-Compression
    is enabled.  The value MAY\n   be treated as a PPP Protocol that indicates that
    another PPP Protocol\n   packet follows.\n   Initial LCP packets contain the sequence
    cf-c0-21 following the\n   header.  When a LCP Configure-Request packet is received
    and\n   recognized, the PPP link enters Link Establishment phase.\n   The accidental
    connection of a link to feed a multipoint network (or\n   multicast group) SHOULD
    result in a misconfiguration indication.\n   This can be detected by multiple
    responses to the LCP Configure-\n   Request with the same Identifier, coming from
    different framing\n   addresses.  Some implementations might be physically unable
    to either\n   log or report such information.\n   Once PPP has entered the Link
    Establishment phase, packets with other\n   NLPID values MUST NOT be sent, and
    on receipt such packets MUST be\n   silently discarded, until the PPP link enters
    the Network-Layer\n   Protocol phase.\n   Once PPP has entered the Network-Layer
    Protocol phase, and\n   successfully negotiated a particular NCP for a PPP Protocol,
    if a\n   frame arrives using another equivalent data encapsulation defined in\n
    \  [4], the PPP Link MUST re-enter Link Establishment phase and send a\n   new
    LCP Configure-Request.  This prevents \"black-holes\" that occur\n   when the
    peer loses state.\n   An implementation which requires PPP link configuration,
    and other\n   PPP negotiated features (such as authentication), MAY enter\n   Termination
    phase when configuration fails.  Otherwise, when the\n   Configure-Request sender
    reaches the Max-Configure limit, it MUST\n   fall back to send only frames encapsulated
    according to [4].\n"

  - "5.  Out-of-Band signaling\n   There is no generally agreed method of out-of-band
    signalling.  Until\n   such a method is universally available, an implementation
    MUST use\n   In-Band Protocol Demultiplexing for both Permanent and Switched\n
    \  Virtual Circuits.\n"
  title: 5.  Out-of-Band signaling
- contents:
  - "6.  Configuration Details\n   The following Configuration Options are recommended:\n
    \     Magic Number\n      Protocol Field Compression\n   The standard LCP configuration
    defaults apply to Frame Relay links,\n   except Maximum-Receive-Unit (MRU).\n
    \  To ensure interoperability with existing Frame Relay implementations,\n   the
    initial MRU is 1600 octets [4].  This only affects the minimum\n   required buffer
    space available for receiving packets, not the size\n   of packets sent.\n   The
    typical network feeding the link is likely to have a MRU of\n   either 1500, or
    2048 or greater.  To avoid fragmentation, the\n   Maximum-Transmission-Unit (MTU)
    at the network layer SHOULD NOT\n   exceed 1500, unless a peer MRU of 2048 or
    greater is specifically\n   negotiated.\n   Some Frame Relay switches are only
    capable of 262 octet frames.  It\n   is not recommended that anyone deploy or
    use a switch which is\n   capable of less than 1600 octet frames.  However, PPP
    implementations\n   MUST be configurable to limit the size of LCP packets which
    are sent\n   to 259 octets (which leaves room for the NLPID and Protocol fields),\n
    \  until LCP negotiation is complete.\n   XID negotiation is not required to be
    supported for links which are\n   capable of PPP negotiation.\n   Inverse ARP
    is not required to be supported for PPP links.  That\n   function is provided
    by PPP NCP negotiation.\n"
