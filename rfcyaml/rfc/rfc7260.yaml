  - "1.  Introduction\n   GMPLS is designed as an out-of-band control plane supporting
    dynamic\n   connection provisioning for any suitable data-plane technology,\n
    \  including spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing\n   port
    or fiber); wavelength-division multiplexing (e.g., Dense\n   Wavelength Division
    Multiplexing (DWDM)); time-division multiplexing\n   (e.g., Synchronous Optical
    Networking and Synchronous Digital\n   Hierarchy (SONET/SDH), G.709); and Ethernet
    Provider Backbone\n   Bridging - Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE) and MPLS.  In most
    of these\n   technologies, there are Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\n
    \  (OAM) functions employed to monitor the health and performance of the\n   connections
    and to trigger data plane (DP) recovery mechanisms.\n   Similar to connection
    provisioning, OAM functions follow general\n   principles but also have some technology-specific
    characteristics.\n   OAM is an integral part of transport connections.  Therefore,
    it is\n   required that OAM functions be activated/deactivated in sync with\n
    \  connection commissioning/decommissioning, in order to avoid spurious\n   alarms
    and ensure consistent operation.  In certain technologies, OAM\n   entities are
    inherently established once the connection is set up,\n   while other technologies
    require extra configuration to establish and\n   configure OAM entities.  In some
    situations, the use of OAM\n   functions, such as Fault Management (FM) and Performance
    Management\n   (PM), may be optional (based on network management policies).  Hence,\n
    \  the network operator must be able to choose which set of OAM\n   functions
    to apply to specific connections and which parameters\n   should be configured
    and activated.  To achieve this objective, OAM\n   entities and specific functions
    must be selectively configurable.\n   In general, it is required that the management-plane
    and\n   control-plane connection establishment mechanisms be synchronized\n   with
    OAM establishment and activation.  In particular, if the GMPLS\n   control plane
    is employed, it is desirable to bind OAM setup and\n   configuration to connection
    establishment signaling to avoid two\n   separate management/configuration steps
    (connection setup followed by\n   OAM configuration), as these separate steps
    increase delay and\n   processing time; more importantly, they may be prone to\n
    \  misconfiguration errors.  Once OAM entities are set up and\n   configured,
    proactive as well as on-demand OAM functions can be\n   activated via the management
    plane.  On the other hand, it should be\n   possible to activate/deactivate proactive
    OAM functions via the GMPLS\n   control plane as well.  In some situations, it
    may be possible to use\n   the GMPLS control plane to control on-demand OAM functions
    too.\n   This document describes requirements for OAM configuration and\n   control
    via Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering\n   (RSVP-TE).  Extensions
    to the RSVP-TE protocol are specified,\n   providing a framework to configure
    and control OAM entities along\n   with the capability to carry technology-specific
    information.\n   Extensions can be grouped into generic elements that are applicable\n
    \  to any OAM solution and technology-specific elements that provide\n   additional
    configuration parameters that may only be needed for\n   a specific OAM technology.
    \ This document specifies the technology-\n   agnostic elements and specifies
    the way that additional\n   technology-specific OAM parameters are provided.  This
    document\n   addresses end-to-end OAM configuration, that is, the setup of OAM\n
    \  entities bound to an end-to-end Label Switched Path (LSP), and\n   configuration
    and control of OAM functions running end-to-end in the\n   LSP.  Configuration
    of OAM entities for LSP segments and tandem\n   connections is outside the scope
    of this document.\n   The mechanisms described in this document provide an additional\n
    \  option for bootstrapping OAM that is not intended to replace or\n   deprecate
    the use of other technology-specific OAM bootstrapping\n   techniques, e.g., LSP
    ping [RFC4379] for MPLS networks.  The\n   procedures specified in this document
    are intended only for use in\n   environments where RSVP-TE signaling is used
    to set up the LSPs that\n   are to be monitored using OAM.\n"

- contents:
  - "2.  Technology-Specific OAM Requirements\n   This section summarizes various
    technology-specific OAM requirements\n   that can be used as a basis for an OAM
    configuration framework.\n   MPLS OAM requirements are described in [RFC4377],
    which provides\n   requirements to create consistent OAM functionality for MPLS\n
    \  networks.  The following list is an excerpt of MPLS OAM requirements\n   documented
    in [RFC4377] that bear direct relevance to the discussion\n   set forth in this
    document:\n   o  It is desired that the automation of LSP defect detection be\n
    \     supported.  It is especially important in cases where large\n      numbers
    of LSPs might be tested.\n   o  In particular, some LSPs may require automated
    testing\n      functionality from the ingress LSR (Label Switching Router) to
    the\n      egress LSR, while others may not.\n   o  Mechanisms are required to
    coordinate network responses to\n      defects.  Such mechanisms may include alarm
    suppression,\n      translating defect signals at technology boundaries, and\n
    \     synchronizing defect detection times by setting appropriately\n      bounded
    detection time frames.\n   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) defines a profile
    of MPLS\n   targeted at transport applications [RFC5921].  This profile specifies\n
    \  the specific MPLS characteristics and extensions required to meet\n   transport
    requirements, including providing additional OAM,\n   survivability, and other
    maintenance functions not currently\n   supported by MPLS.  Specific OAM requirements
    for MPLS-TP are\n   specified in [RFC5654] and [RFC5860].  MPLS-TP poses the following\n
    \  requirements on the control plane to configure and control OAM\n   entities:\n
    \  o  From [RFC5860]: OAM functions MUST operate and be configurable\n      even
    in the absence of a control plane.  Conversely, it SHOULD be\n      possible to
    configure as well as enable/disable the capability to\n      operate OAM functions
    as part of connectivity management, and it\n      SHOULD also be possible to configure
    as well as enable/disable the\n      capability to operate OAM functions after
    connectivity has been\n      established.\n   o  From [RFC5654]: The MPLS-TP control
    plane MUST support the\n      configuration and modification of OAM maintenance
    points as well\n      as the activation/deactivation of OAM when the transport
    path or\n      transport service is established or modified.\n   Ethernet Connectivity
    Fault Management (CFM) defines an adjunct OAM\n   flow that monitors connectivity
    in order to check the liveliness of\n   Ethernet networks [IEEE.802.1Q-2011].
    \ With PBB-TE\n   [IEEE.802.1Q-2011], Ethernet networks support explicitly routed\n
    \  Ethernet connections.  CFM can be used to track the liveliness of\n   PBB-TE
    connections and detect data-plane failures.  In the IETF, the\n   GMPLS Ethernet
    Label Switching (GELS) (see [RFC5828] and [RFC6060])\n   work extended the GMPLS
    control plane to support the establishment of\n   PBB-TE data-plane connections.
    \ Without control-plane support,\n   separate management commands would be needed
    to configure and\n   start CFM.\n   GMPLS-based OAM configuration and control
    need to provide a general\n   framework to be applicable to a wide range of data-plane
    technologies\n   and OAM solutions.  There are three typical data-plane technologies\n
    \  used for transport applications: wavelength based, such as Wavelength\n   Switched
    Optical Networks (WSON); Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)\n   based, such as Synchronous
    Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Synchronous\n   Optical Networking (SONET); and packet
    based, such as MPLS-TP\n   [RFC5921] and Ethernet PBB-TE [IEEE.802.1Q-2011].  For
    all these data\n   planes, the operator MUST be able to configure and control
    the\n   following OAM functions:\n   o  It MUST be possible to explicitly request
    the setup of OAM\n      entities for the signaled LSP and provide specific information
    for\n      the setup if this is required by the technology.\n   o  Control of
    alarms is important to avoid false alarm indications\n      and reporting to the
    management system.  It MUST be possible to\n      enable/disable alarms generated
    by OAM functions.  In some cases,\n      selective alarm control may be desirable
    when, for instance, the\n      operator is only concerned about critical alarms.
    \ Therefore,\n      alarms that do not affect service should be inhibited.\n   o
    \ When periodic messages are used for liveliness checks (Continuity\n      Checks
    (CCs)) of LSPs, it MUST be possible to set the frequency of\n      messages.  This
    allows proper configuration for fulfilling the\n      requirements of the service
    and/or meeting the detection time\n      boundaries posed by possible congruent
    connectivity-check\n      operations of higher-layer applications.  For a network
    operator\n      to be able to balance the trade-off between fast failure detection\n
    \     and data overhead, it is beneficial to configure the frequency of\n      CC
    messages on a per-LSP basis.\n   o  Proactive Performance Monitoring (PM) functions
    are used to\n      continuously collect information about specific characteristics
    of\n      the connection.  For consistent measurement of Service Level\n      Agreements
    (SLAs), it MUST be possible to set common configuration\n      parameters for
    the LSP.\n   o  The extensions MUST allow the operator to use only a minimal set\n
    \     of OAM configuration and control features if supported by the OAM\n      solution
    or network management policy.  Generic OAM parameters, as\n      well as parameters
    specific to data-plane technology or OAM\n      technology, MUST be supported.\n"

  - "3.  RSVP-TE-Based OAM Configuration\n   In general, two types of maintenance
    points can be distinguished:\n   Maintenance Entity Group End Points (MEPs) and
    Maintenance Entity\n   Group Intermediate Points (MIPs).  MEPs reside at the ends
    of an LSP\n   and are capable of initiating and terminating OAM messages for Fault\n
    \  Management (FM) and Performance Monitoring (PM).  MIPs, on the other\n   hand,
    are located at transit nodes of an LSP and are capable of\n   reacting to some
    OAM messages but otherwise do not initiate messages.\n   \"Maintenance Entity\"
    (ME) refers to an association of MEPs and MIPs\n   that are provisioned to monitor
    an LSP.\n   When an LSP is signaled, a forwarding association is established\n
    \  between endpoints and transit nodes via label bindings.  This\n   association
    creates a context for the OAM entities monitoring the\n   LSP.  On top of this
    association, OAM entities may be configured to\n   unambiguously identify MEs.\n
    \  In addition to ME identification parameters, proactive OAM functions\n   (e.g.,
    CC and PM) may have additional parameters that require\n   configuration as well.
    \ In particular, the frequency of periodic CC\n   packets, and the measurement
    interval for loss and delay\n   measurements, may need to be configured.\n   The
    above parameters may be derived from information related to LSP\n   provisioning;
    alternatively, pre-configured default values can be\n   used.  In the simplest
    case, the control plane MAY provide\n   information on whether or not OAM entities
    need to be set up for the\n   signaled LSP.  If OAM entities are created, control-plane
    signaling\n   MUST also provide a means to activate/deactivate OAM message flows\n
    \  and associated alarms.\n   OAM identifiers, as well as the configuration of
    OAM functions, are\n   technology specific (i.e., they vary, depending on the
    data-plane\n   technology and the chosen OAM solution).  In addition, for any
    given\n   data-plane technology, a set of OAM solutions may be applicable.\n   Therefore,
    the OAM configuration framework allows selecting a\n   specific OAM solution to
    be used for the signaled LSP and provides\n   means to carry detailed OAM configuration
    information in technology-\n   specific TLVs.\n   Administrative Status Information
    is carried in the Admin_Status\n   object.  Administrative Status Information
    is described in [RFC3471],\n   and the Admin_Status object is specified for RSVP-TE
    in [RFC3473].\n   Two bits are allocated for the administrative control of OAM\n
    \  monitoring: the \"OAM Flows Enabled\" (M) and \"OAM Alarms Enabled\" (O)\n
    \  bits.  When the \"OAM Flows Enabled\" bit is set, OAM mechanisms MUST\n   be
    enabled; if it is cleared, OAM mechanisms MUST be disabled.  When\n   the \"OAM
    Alarms Enabled\" bit is set, OAM-triggered alarms are enabled\n   and associated
    consequent actions MUST be executed, including the\n   notification to the management
    system.  When this bit is cleared,\n   alarms are suppressed and no action SHOULD
    be executed, and the\n   management system SHOULD NOT be notified.\n   The LSP_ATTRIBUTES
    and LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects are defined in\n   [RFC5420] to provide means
    to signal LSP attributes and options in\n   the form of TLVs.  Options and attributes
    signaled in the\n   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object can be passed transparently through
    LSRs not\n   supporting a particular option or attribute, while the contents of\n
    \  the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object MUST be examined and processed by\n   each
    LSR.  The \"OAM MEP entities desired\" bit is allocated in the\n   Attribute Flags
    TLV [RFC5420] to be used in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES\n   object.  If the \"OAM MEP entities
    desired\" bit is set, it indicates\n   that the establishment of OAM MEP entities
    is required at the\n   endpoints of the signaled LSP.  The \"OAM MIP entities
    desired\" bit is\n   allocated in the Attribute Flags TLV to be used in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES\n
    \  or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects.  If the \"OAM MIP entities\n   desired\"
    bit is set in the Attribute Flags TLV in the\n   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object,
    it indicates that the establishment\n   of OAM MIP entities is required at every
    transit node of the\n   signaled LSP.\n"

    - "3.1.  Establishment of OAM Entities and Functions\n   In order to avoid spurious
      alarms, OAM functions should be set up and\n   enabled in the appropriate order.
      \ When using the GMPLS control plane\n   for both LSP establishment and enabling
      OAM functions on the LSPs,\n   the control of both processes is bound to RSVP-TE
      message exchanges.\n   An LSP may be signaled and established without OAM configuration\n
      \  first, and OAM entities may be added later with a subsequent\n   re-signaling
      of the LSP.  Alternatively, the LSP may be set up with\n   OAM entities with
      the first signaling of the LSP.  The procedures\n   below apply to both cases.\n
      \  Before initiating a Path message with OAM configuration information,\n   an
      initiating node MUST establish and configure the corresponding OAM\n   entities
      locally.  But until the LSP is established, OAM source\n   functions MUST NOT
      start sending any OAM messages.  In the case of\n   bidirectional connections,
      in addition to the OAM source function,\n   the initiator node MUST set up the
      OAM sink function and prepare it\n   to receive OAM messages.  During this time
      the OAM alarms MUST be\n   suppressed (e.g., due to missing or unidentified
      OAM messages).  To\n   achieve OAM alarm suppression, Path messages MUST be
      sent with the\n   \"OAM Alarms Enabled\" Admin_Status flag cleared.\n   When
      the Path message arrives at the receiver, the remote end MUST\n   establish
      and configure OAM entities according to the OAM information\n   provided in
      the Path message.  If this is not possible, a PathErr\n   message SHOULD be
      sent, and neither the OAM entities nor the LSP\n   SHOULD be established.  If
      OAM entities are established successfully,\n   the OAM sink function MUST be
      prepared to receive OAM messages but\n   MUST NOT generate any OAM alarms (e.g.,
      due to missing or\n   unidentified OAM messages).  In the case of bidirectional\n
      \  connections, in addition to the OAM sink function, an OAM source\n   function
      MUST be set up and, according to the requested\n   configuration, the OAM source
      function MUST start sending OAM\n   messages.  A Resv message MUST then be sent
      back, including the\n   Attribute Flags TLV, with the appropriate setting of
      the \"OAM MEP\n   entities desired\" and \"OAM MIP entities desired\" flags,
      and the OAM\n   Configuration TLV that corresponds to the established and configured\n
      \  OAM entities and functions.  Depending on the OAM technology, some\n   elements
      of the OAM Configuration TLV MAY be updated/changed, i.e.,\n   if the remote
      end does not support a certain OAM configuration it may\n   suggest an alternative
      setting, which may or may not be accepted by\n   the initiator of the Path message.
      \ If it is accepted, the initiator\n   will reconfigure its OAM functions according
      to the information\n   received in the Resv message.  If the alternate setting
      is not\n   acceptable, a ResvErr message MAY be sent, tearing down the LSP.\n
      \  Details of this operation are technology specific and should be\n   described
      in accompanying technology-specific documents.\n   When the initiating side
      receives the Resv message, it completes any\n   pending OAM configuration and
      enables the OAM source function to send\n   OAM messages.\n   After this exchange,
      OAM entities are established and configured for\n   the LSP, and OAM messages
      are exchanged.  OAM alarms can now be\n   enabled.  During the period when OAM
      alarms are disabled, the\n   initiator sends a Path message with the \"OAM Alarms
      Enabled\"\n   Admin_Status flag set.  The receiving node enables OAM alarms
      after\n   processing the Path message.  The initiator enables OAM alarms after\n
      \  it receives the Resv message.  Data-plane OAM is now fully\n   functional.\n
      \  If an egress LSR does not support the extensions defined in this\n   document,
      according to [RFC5420], it will silently ignore the new LSP\n   attribute flags
      as well as the TLVs carrying additional OAM\n   configuration information, and
      therefore no error will be raised that\n   would notify the ingress LSR about
      the missing OAM configuration\n   actions on the egress side.  However, as described
      above, an egress\n   LSR conformant to the specification of this document will
      set the LSP\n   attribute flags and include the OAM Configuration TLV in the
      Resv\n   message indicating the configuration of the OAM mechanisms;\n   therefore,
      by detecting the missing information in the Resv message,\n   an ingress LSR
      will be able to recognize that the remote end does not\n   support the OAM configuration
      functionality, and therefore it SHOULD\n   tear down the LSP and, if appropriate,
      signal the LSP without any OAM\n   configuration information.\n"

    - "3.2.  Adjustment of OAM Parameters\n   There may be a need to change the parameters
      of an already-\n   established and configured OAM function during the lifetime
      of the\n   LSP.  To do so, the LSP needs to be re-signaled with the updated\n
      \  parameters.  OAM parameters influence the content and timing of OAM\n   messages
      and also identify the way that OAM defects and alarms are\n   derived and generated.
      \ Hence, to avoid spurious alarms, it is\n   important that both sides -- OAM
      sink and source -- are updated in a\n   synchronized way.  First, the alarms
      of the OAM sink function should\n   be suppressed and only then should expected
      OAM parameters be\n   adjusted.  Subsequently, the parameters of the OAM source
      function\n   can be updated.  Finally, the alarms of the OAM sink side can be\n
      \  enabled again.\n   In accordance with the above operation, the LSP MUST first
      be\n   re-signaled with the \"OAM Alarms Enabled\" Admin_Status flag cleared,\n
      \  including the updated OAM Configuration TLV corresponding to the new\n   parameter
      settings.  The initiator MUST keep its OAM sink and source\n   functions running
      unmodified, but it MUST suppress OAM alarms after\n   the updated Path message
      is sent.  The receiver MUST first disable\n   all OAM alarms and then update
      the OAM parameters according to the\n   information in the Path message and
      reply with a Resv message\n   acknowledging the changes by including the OAM
      Configuration TLV.\n   Note that the receiving side can adjust the requested
      OAM\n   configuration parameters and reply with an updated OAM Configuration\n
      \  TLV in the Resv message, reflecting the values that are actually\n   configured.
      \ However, in order to avoid an extensive negotiation\n   phase, in the case
      of adjusting already-configured OAM functions, the\n   receiving side SHOULD
      NOT update the parameters requested in the Path\n   message to an extent that
      would provide lower performance (e.g.,\n   lower frequency of monitoring packets)
      than what had previously been\n   in place.\n   The initiator MUST only update
      its OAM sink and source functions\n   after it receives the Resv message.  After
      this Path/Resv message\n   exchange (in both unidirectional and bidirectional
      LSP cases), the\n   OAM parameters are updated, and OAM is running according
      to the new\n   parameter settings.  However, OAM alarms are still disabled.
      \ A\n   subsequent Path/Resv message exchange with the \"OAM Alarms Enabled\"\n
      \  Admin_Status flag set is needed to enable OAM alarms again.\n"

      or all OAM entities\n   and functions from an LSP without actually tearing down
      the\n   connection.\n   To avoid any spurious alarms, first the LSP MUST be
      re-signaled with\n   the \"OAM Alarms Enabled\" Admin_Status flag cleared but
      with OAM\n   configuration unchanged.  Subsequently, the LSP is re-signaled
      with\n   \"OAM MEP entities desired\" and \"OAM MIP entities desired\" LSP\n
      \  attribute flags cleared, and without the OAM Configuration TLV, this\n   MUST

      control-plane and data-plane resources in use by the OAM\n   entities and functions
      SHOULD be freed up.  Alternatively, if only\n   some OAM functions need to be
      removed, the LSP is re-signaled with\n   the updated OAM Configuration TLV.
      \ Changes between the contents of\n   the previously signaled OAM Configuration
      TLV and the currently\n   received TLV represent which functions MUST be removed/added.\n
      \  OAM source functions MUST be deleted first, and only after the \"OAM\n   Alarms
      Disabled\" can the associated OAM sink functions be removed;\n   this will ensure
      that OAM messages do not leak outside the LSP.  To\n   this end, the initiator,
      before sending the Path message, MUST remove\n   the OAM source, hence terminating
      the OAM message flow associated to\n   the downstream direction.  In the case
      of a bidirectional connection,\n   it MUST leave in place the OAM sink functions

      object is used\n   to indicate options and attributes of the LSP.  The Flags
      field has\n   8 bits and hence is limited to differentiate only 8 options.\n
      \  [RFC5420] defines new objects for RSVP-TE messages to allow the\n   signaling
      of arbitrary attribute parameters, making RSVP-TE easily\n   extensible to support
      new applications.  Furthermore, [RFC5420]\n   allows options and attributes
      that do not need to be acted on by all\n   Label Switching Routers (LSRs) along
      the path of the LSP.  In\n   particular, these options and attributes may apply
      only to key LSRs\n   on the path, such as the ingress LSR and egress LSR.  Options
      and\n   attributes can be signaled transparently and only examined at those\n
      \  points that need to act on them.  The LSP_ATTRIBUTES and\n   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES
      objects are defined in [RFC5420] to provide\n   means to signal LSP attributes
      and options in the form of TLVs.\n   Options and attributes signaled in the
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object can be\n   passed transparently through LSRs not supporting
      a particular option\n   or attribute, while the contents of the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES\n
      \  object MUST be examined and processed by each LSR.  One TLV is\n   defined
      in [RFC5420]: the Attribute Flags TLV.\n   One bit (bit number 10): \"OAM MEP
      entities desired\" is allocated in\n   the Attribute Flags TLV to be used in
      the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.  If\n   the \"OAM MEP entities desired\" bit is set,
      it indicates that the\n   establishment of OAM MEP entities is required at the
      endpoints of the\n   signaled LSP.  If the establishment of MEPs is not supported,
      an\n   error MUST be generated: \"OAM Problem/MEP establishment not\n   supported\".\n
      \  If the \"OAM MEP entities desired\" bit is set and additional\n   parameters
      need to be configured, an OAM Configuration TLV MAY be\n   included in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES
      or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object.\n   One bit (bit number 11): \"OAM MIP entities
      desired\" is allocated in\n   the Attribute Flags TLV to be used in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES
      or\n   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects.  If the \"OAM MEP entities desired\"\n
      \  bit is not set, then this bit MUST NOT be set.  If the \"OAM MIP\n   entities
      desired\" bit is set in the Attribute Flags TLV in the\n   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES
      object, it indicates that the establishment\n   of OAM MIP entities is required
      at every transit node of the signaled\n   LSP.  If the establishment of a MIP
      is not supported, an error MUST\n   be generated: \"OAM Problem/MIP establishment
      not supported\".  If an\n   intermediate LSR does not support the extensions
      defined in this\n   document, it will not recognize the \"OAM MIP entities desired\"
      flag\n   and, although the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object was used, it will\n
      \  not configure MIP entities and will not raise any errors.  If LSRs\n   that
      do not support the extensions defined in this document are to be\n   assumed
      as present in the network, the ingress LSR SHOULD collect\n   per-hop information
      about the LSP attributes utilizing the LSP\n   Attributes sub-object of the
      Record Route object (RRO) as defined in\n   [RFC5420].  When the Record Route
      object is received, the ingress\n   SHOULD check whether all intermediate LSRs
      set the \"OAM MIP entities\n   desired\" flag indicating support of the function;
      if not, depending\n   on operator policy, the LSP MAY need to be torn down.\n"

      for the establishment of point-to-multipoint\n   (P2MP) LSPs are specified in
      [RFC4875].  A P2MP LSP is comprised of\n   multiple source-to-leaf (S2L) sub-LSPs.
      \ These S2L sub-LSPs are set\n   up between the ingress and egress LSRs and
      are appropriately combined\n   by the branch LSRs using RSVP semantics to result
      in a P2MP TE LSP.\n   One Path message may signal one or multiple S2L sub-LSPs
      for a single\n   P2MP LSP.  Hence, the S2L sub-LSPs belonging to a P2MP LSP
      can be\n   signaled using one Path message or split across multiple Path\n   messages.\n
      \  P2MP OAM mechanisms are very specific to the data-plane technology;\n   therefore,
      in this document we only highlight the basic principles of\n   P2MP OAM configuration.
      \ We consider only the root-to-leaf OAM flows,\n   and as such, aspects of the
      configuration of return paths are outside\n   the scope of our discussions.
      \ We also limit our consideration to the\n   case where all leaves must successfully
      establish OAM entities with\n   identical configuration in order for the P2MP
      OAM to be successfully\n   established.  In any case, the discussion set forth
      below provides\n   only guidelines for P2MP OAM configuration.  However, at
      a minimum,\n   the procedures below SHOULD be specified for P2MP OAM configuration\n
      \  in a technology-specific document.\n   The root node may use a single Path
      message or multiple Path messages\n   to set up the whole P2MP tree.  In the
      case when multiple Path\n   messages are used, the root node is responsible
      for keeping the OAM\n   configuration information consistent in each of the
      sent Path\n   messages, i.e., the same information MUST be included in all Path\n
      \  messages used to construct the multicast tree.  Each branching node\n   will
      propagate the Path message downstream on each of the branches;\n   when constructing
      a Path message, the OAM configuration information\n   MUST be copied unchanged
      from the received Path message, including\n   the related Admin_Status bits,
      LSP attribute flags, and OAM\n   Configuration TLV.  The latter two also imply
      that the LSP_ATTRIBUTES\n   and LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects MUST be copied
      for the upstream\n   Path message to the subsequent downstream Path messages.\n
      \  Leaves MUST create and configure OAM sink functions according to the\n   parameters
      received in the Path message; for P2MP OAM configuration,\n   there is no possibility
      for parameter negotiation on a per-leaf\n   basis.  This is due to the fact
      that the OAM source function,\n   residing in the root of the tree, will operate
      with a single\n   configuration, which then must be obeyed by all leaves.  If
      a leaf\n   cannot accept the OAM parameters, it MUST use the RRO Attributes\n
      \  sub-object [RFC5420] to notify the root about the problem.  In\n   particular,
      if the OAM configuration was successful, the leaf would\n   set the \"OAM MEP
      entities desired\" flag in the RRO Attributes\n   sub-object in the Resv message.
      \ On the other hand, if OAM entities\n   could not be established, the Resv
      message should be sent with the\n   \"OAM MEP entities desired\" bit cleared
      in the RRO Attributes\n   sub-object.  Branching nodes should collect and merge
      the received\n   RROs according to the procedures described in [RFC4875].  This
      way,\n   the root, when receiving the Resv message (or messages if multiple\n
      \  Path messages were used to set up the tree), will have clear\n   information
      about which of the leaves could establish the OAM\n   functions.  If all leaves
      established OAM entities successfully, the\n   root can enable the OAM message
      flow.  On the other hand, if at some\n   leaves the establishment was unsuccessful,
      additional actions will be\n   needed before the OAM message flow can be enabled.
      \ Such action could\n   be to set up two independent P2MP LSPs:\n   o  One LSP
      with OAM configuration information towards leaves that can\n      support the
      OAM function.  This can be done by pruning from the\n      previously signaled
      P2MP LSP the leaves that failed to set up OAM.\n   o  The other P2MP LSP could
      be constructed for leaves without OAM\n      entities.\n   The exact procedures
      will be described in technology-specific\n   documents.\n"

  title: 5.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The signaling of OAM-related parameters and the
    automatic\n   establishment of OAM entities based on RSVP-TE messages add a new\n
    \  aspect to the security considerations discussed in [RFC3473].  In\n   particular,
    a network element could be overloaded if a remote\n   attacker targeted that element
    by sending frequent periodic messages\n   requesting liveliness monitoring of
    a high number of LSPs.  Such an\n   attack can efficiently be prevented when mechanisms
    for message\n   integrity and node authentication are deployed.  Since the OAM\n
    \  configuration extensions rely on the hop-by-hop exchange of exiting\n   RSVP-TE
    messages, procedures specified for RSVP message security in\n   [RFC2747] can
    be used to mitigate possible attacks.\n   For a more comprehensive discussion
    of GMPLS security and attack\n   mitigation techniques, please see the Security
    Framework for MPLS and\n   GMPLS Networks [RFC5920].\n"
