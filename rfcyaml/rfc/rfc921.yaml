  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo is a policy statement on the implementation\
    \ of the Domain\n   Style Naming System in the Internet.  This memo is an update\
    \ of\n   RFC-881, and RFC-897.  This is an official policy statement of the\n\
    \   IAB and the DARPA.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n   The intent\
    \ of this memo is to detail the schedule for the\n   implementation for the Domain\
    \ Style Naming System.  The explanation\n   of how this system works is to be\
    \ found in the references.\n"
- title: The Current Situation
  contents:
  - "The Current Situation\n   There are three aspects to the domain style naming\
    \ system, (1) the\n   names themselves, (2) the method of translating names to\
    \ addresses,\n   and (3) the relationship between the Internet and the rest of\
    \ the\n   world.\n   Names\n      The names are being changed from simple names,\
    \ or globally unique\n      strings, to structured names, where each component\
    \ name is unique\n      only with respect to the superior component name.\n  \
    \    Simple Names\n         Until recently, hosts in the DARPA research and DDN\
    \ operational\n         communities were assigned names in a flat or global name\
    \ space\n         of character strings.  There are some limits on these names.\n\
    \         They must start with a letter, end with a letter or digit and\n    \
    \     have only letters or digits or hyphen as interior characters.\n        \
    \ Case is not significant.\n            For example:  USC-ISIF\n      Hierarchical\
    \ Names\n         Because of the growth of the Internet, structured names (or\n\
    \         domain style names) have been introduced.  Each element of the\n   \
    \      structured name will be a character string (with the same\n         constraints\
    \ that previously applied to the simple names).  The\n"

    \ the structured names are separated\n         with periods, and the elements\
    \ are written from the most\n         specific on the left to the most general\
    \ on the right.\n            For example:  USC-ISIF.ARPA\n      The Initial and\
    \ Temporary Domain\n         The introduction of these hierarchical names has\
    \ been very\n         limited.  Every current name in this new system has the\
    \ form\n         \"old-simple-name.ARPA\".  That is, the all the hosts are in\
    \ a\n         domain called \"ARPA\".  This is a temporary situation.  The\n \
    \        current intention is for the ARPA domain to cease to exist.\n       \
    \  This means that all hosts will change their names as the domain\n         style\
    \ names come into full use.\n   Name to Address Lookup\n      Every host in the\
    \ Internet is expected to have a way of\n      translating the name of any other\
    \ host into its Internet address.\n      By and large, the name to address translation\
    \ is done by looking\n      up the information in a table of all hosts.\n    \
    \  The maintenance of this table is centralized at the Network\n      Information\
    \ Center (NIC).  Each host is expected to obtain a\n      current copy of the\
    \ table on a timely basis.  This table is called\n      \"HOSTS.TXT\" [8] and\
    \ is normally accessed via the Hostnames\n      Server [9].\n   Interface to the\
    \ World\n      A great deal of mail moves between the Internet and other\n   \
    \   \"systems\" that somehow transport mail among computers.  This is\n      currently\
    \ done by hiding some sort of \"other-system\" addressing\n      information in\
    \ the local-part of the mail address and using a\n      mail-relay host in the\
    \ host-part of the mailbox.\n      For example,\n         OBERST%EDUCOM.MAILNET@MIT-MULTICS.ARPA\n\
    \         EDMISTON.CIC@CSNET-RELAY.ARPA\n"

  - "The Future Situation\n   Names\n      Hierarchical Names\n         The use of\
    \ the hierarchical names will be greatly expanded\n         according to the rules\
    \ established in the \"Domain Requirements\"\n         memo (RFC-920) [5].\n \
    \           For example:  F.ISI.USC.EDU\n      There are several levels of development\
    \ for use of the domain\n      style names.\n      First, there is the current\
    \ simple substitution of the domain\n      style names for the old style host\
    \ names.  At this stage all\n      domain style names directly translate to host\
    \ addresses (using the\n      NIC tables) and all domain style names have two\
    \ components.  The\n      mail system uses addresses of the form \"local-part@host\"\
    , where\n      host is a domain style host name.\n         For example:  USC-ISIF.ARPA\
    \  and  Postel@USC-ISIF.ARPA\n         Here we expect that \"USC-ISIF.ARPA\" is\
    \ the name of an Internet\n         host and that we can send mail for \"Postel\"\
    \ to the SMTP port on\n         that host.  It may be that some backward host\
    \ can still fake it\n         by ignoring the \".ARPA\" and looking up an address\
    \ for\n         \"USC-ISIF\" in some old style file.\n      Second, there is an\
    \ extension to more name components and more top\n      level domains.  The mail\
    \ system still uses addresses of the form\n      \"local-part@host\", where host\
    \ is a domain style host name.\n         For example:  F.ISI.USC.EDU  and  Postel@F.ISI.USC.EDU\n\
    \         Here we expect that \"F.ISI.USC.EDU\" is the name of an Internet\n \
    \        host and that we can send mail for \"Postel\" to the SMTP port on\n \
    \        that host.  It is likely that the NIC will enter these new\n        \
    \ domain style names in the centrally maintained table (i.e.,\n         HOSTS.TXT)\
    \ during the transition period.  It is unlikely that a\n         backward host\
    \ can hack this at all.\n      Third, there is an extension to domain style names\
    \ that may\n      represent only organizations or administrative entities.  Finding\n\

    \      By and large, the name to address translation will be done by\n      interacting\

- title: The Transition Situation
  contents:
  - "The Transition Situation\n   Actually, the situation is a bit more complicated,\
    \ of course.  Hosts\n   are already using domain style names under the constraint\
    \ that their\n   domain style name is exactly their old style name with the string\n\
    \   \".ARPA\" appended.  The first transition step is to ensure that all\n   hosts\
    \ do this, and then to eliminate the use of old style names\n   altogether.\n\
    \   Please note carefully that two types of changes are being made:\n      One\
    \ is a change in the support mechanism for translating a host\n      name to an\
    \ internet address,\n         that is from using local copies of a full centrally\
    \ maintained\n         table to dynamically accessing a distributed set of servers\n\
    \         each posesing a portion of a data base maintained in a\n         distributed\
    \ fashion.\n      The other is a change in the host names themselves,\n      \
    \   from a flat global space of unstructured strings to a\n         hierarchical\
    \ structure of names.\n   There are two steps to the transition plan.\n      First,\
    \ change from old names to domain style names.\n      Second, change from using\
    \ central tables to using name servers.\n   There are two communities that are\
    \ taking slightly different courses\n   in this transition.  The DARPA research\
    \ community is making the full\n   transition.  The DDN operational community\

- title: All Hosts Change Names
  contents:
  - "All Hosts Change Names\n   The impact of introducing the domain style names is\
    \ that all hosts\n   change their names at least once.  Hosts that move to new\
    \ domains or\n   subdomains may change their names several times.\n   Hosts have\
    \ an official (or primary) name and possibly several\n   nicknames.  When mail\
    \ is sent from a host, the official name is used\n   in the mail header address\
    \ fields.\n   Suppose, that in the old days before domains were thought of, a\
    \ host\n   changed its name.  What is the impact on users of changing the name\n\
    \   of a host?\n      Mail that was sent before the name was changed can not be\
    \ answered\n      using mail program commands that automatically fill in the return\n\
    \      address.  While it may be possible to use special tricks to fix up\n  \
    \    the \"From\" or the \"To\" users addresses, the \"Cc\" addresses are\n  \
    \    very difficult to correct.\n         Suppose one host changed its name from\
    \ FOO to BAR.  Mail that\n         was sent from FRED@FOO to JOE@ABC can not be\
    \ answered unless\n         the change of name is known to the user or the mail\
    \ program at\n         ABC and the host name BAR substituted for FOO.  Mail that\
    \ is\n         sent to JOE@ABC from SAM@DEF with a cc to FRED@FOO can not be\n\
    \         answered easily.\n      Any mailing lists that have mailboxes with the\
    \ host that changed\n      names will now have incorrect entries.\n   The point\
    \ is that while the host that changed names may be able to\n   use special tricks\
    \ for a while to fix things up for the users, it is\n   difficult for other hosts\
    \ to do this.\n"

  - "Appendix : The Old Time Table\n   Here we present the time table from the previous\
    \ schedule (RFC-897)\n   with some comments on what was and was not accomplished.\n\
    \   -- Nov 83  Plan and Schedule\n      At this point the overall plan for the\
    \ implementation of domain\n      style names and name servers, and a schedule\
    \ of events was\n      published (RFC-881).  Also the design and specification\
    \ for the\n      protocol and data base were published (RFC-882, RFC-883).\n \
    \        <This was done, but the schedule did not work.>\n   -- Nov 83  Initial\
    \ Domain Style Host Name Table\n      At this point a version of the host table\
    \ which includes the\n      domain style names is made available (DHOSTS.TXT).\n\
    \         <This was done, on schedule.>\n   -- Feb 84  Domain Requirements Specification\n\
    \      At this point the requirements for establishing a new domain are\n    \
    \  published as an RFC.\n         <This topic was much discussed in the Namedroppers\
    \ mailing\n         list, but no RFC was published until Oct84 [5].>\n   14 Mar\
    \ 84  Begin using Domain Style Names\n      At this point all hosts should start\
    \ using their domain style\n      names as their official and primary names. \
    \ The standard table of\n      host names contains domain style names as the official\
    \ and primary\n      name (DHOSTS.TXT becomes HOSTS.TXT).\n         <This was\
    \ done, on schedule.>\n   04 Apr 84  Server for ARPA Domain\n      At this point\
    \ several domain name servers are in operation to\n      supply host name to internet\
    \ address translations, one of these\n      servers is at the NIC.\n         <This\
    \ was done, not on schedule, but by Sep84.>\n"

    \ this point a master table of top level domain names and their\n      associated\
    \ servers is established at the NIC.\n         <Not done yet.>\n   02 May 84 \
    \ Stop using old style Names\n      At this point the use of old style names must\
    \ be completely phased\n      out.\n         <I think this is done.  Except that\
    \ some hosts still use the\n         OHOSTS.TXT file.>\n   02 May 84  Certain\
    \ New Domains\n      At this point a few new domains may be established, in particular\n\
    \      the DDN domain.\n         <Not done yet.  Well, \"DDN\" won't be a top\
    \ level domain\n         according to the new rules (see [5]).>\n   06 Jun 84\
    \  General & Multilevel Domains\n      At this point additional new domains may\
    \ be established, if they\n      meet the requirements.  Domain style names may\
    \ have more than two\n      segments.\n         <Not done yet.>\n   18 Jul 84\
    \  Organizational Domains\n      Domain style names may identify organizations.\
    \  Finding an address\n      for a host may involve a level of indirection.\n\
    \         <Not done yet.>\n   05 Sep 84  Decommission Host Table\n      At this\
    \ point the master host table maintained by the NIC need no\n      longer be complete\
    \ for the DARPA research community.  A full table\n      of the DDN operational\
    \ hosts will be maintained by the NIC.\n         <Not done yet.>\n"
