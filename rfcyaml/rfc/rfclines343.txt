All sites with Model 516 IMP's have been contacted by telephone and asked to set the switches on their IMP's as follows:
Please be sure that your switches remain set at these positions until further notice.
No site should attempt to use the IMP's "Trace" routine during the day(s) of the attempted system release.
Terminal IMP's may be turned off for significant portions of the day(s) of the attempted system release.
Please be patient with any inconvenience which this causes.
We hope to accomplish release of IMPSYS 2600 on the next attempt.
Nevertheless, we are not omniscient and may again be thwarted by difficulties.
We will arrange the release process so that site operator coverage is not required; nevertheless we hope that the normal site operator coverage is available in case unanticipated problems develop.
Release of the new system will begin early in the day (approximately 7 a.m. EDT).
We again suggest that sites do not schedule production work over the network during the release attempt(s).
We will notify each site by phone after the release has been successfully completed.
Finally, we apologize in advance for any inconvenience caused by the contortions required to release this new system, and thank all of the site operations' staffs who worked with us on May 15 for their cooperation.
