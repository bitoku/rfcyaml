    Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control (RTP/AVP)\n"
  title: __initial_text__
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control\n
    \  (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure\n   Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for\n   Real-time Transport
    Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback\n   (RTP/AVPF), and the Extended Secure
    RTP Profile for RTCP-Based\n   Feedback (RTP/SAVPF).  This document updates RFC
    3551, the RTP/AVP\n   profile (and by extension, the profiles that build upon
    it), to\n   reflect changes in audio codec usage since that document was\n   originally
    published.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC3551] says that audio applications operating under the
    RTP/AVP\n   profile SHOULD be able to send and receive PCMU and DVI4.  However,\n
    \  in practice, many RTP deployments do not support DVI4, and there is\n   little
    reason to use it when much more modern codecs are available.\n   This document
    updates the recommended audio codec selection for the\n   RTP/AVP profile and
    removes the SHOULD for DVI4.  By extension, this\n   also updates the profiles
    that build on RTP/AVP, including RTP/SAVP\n   [RFC3711], RTP/AVPF [RFC4585], and
    RTP/SAVPF [RFC5124].\n"

    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"

  - "3.  Updates to RFC 3551\n   The following text of [RFC3551] is hereby updated
    as set forth in\n   Section 3.1:\n      Audio applications operating under this
    profile SHOULD, at a\n      minimum, be able to send and/or receive payload types
    0 (PCMU)\n      and 5 (DVI4).  This allows interoperability without format\n      negotiation
    and ensures successful negotiation with a conference\n      control protocol.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Updates to Section 6 of RFC 3551\n   This document updates the final
      paragraph of Section 6 of RFC 3551 by\n   replacing \"payload types 0 (PCMU)
      and 5 (DVI4)\" with \"payload\n   type 0 (PCMU)\".  We also add a final sentence
      to that paragraph that\n   states, \"Some environments necessitate support for
      PCMU\".  This\n   results in the following paragraph:\n      Audio applications
      operating under this profile SHOULD, at a\n      minimum, be able to send and/or
      receive payload type 0 (PCMU).\n      This allows interoperability without format
      negotiation and\n      ensures successful negotiation with a conference control
      protocol.\n      Some environments necessitate support for PCMU.\n"
