The NMC is a research site and would like to have prior arrangement with each user.
(Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)
(Destination Host opened a connection, informed user that all Network ports were in use, and immediately closed the connection.)
H   1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)
(Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to users.)
(Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)
(Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a connection with 60 seconds.)
Network Job Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to test (NETRJS).
We are assuming that initial connection to the NETRJS logger indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.
# These sites advertise that they may not have their system available at these times.
