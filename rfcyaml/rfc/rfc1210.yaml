- title: SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND TARGETS
  contents:
  - "SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND TARGETS\n   EMAIL (6.1) Initiate an\
    \ intercontinental email operations forum\n   involving email service providers\
    \ in the US and Europe to define and\n   implement operational procedures leading\
    \ to high reliability.  The\n   forum should be tasked with analysing interoperability\
    \ problems in\n   the existing email systems, and with developing functional and\n\
    \   performance specifications for email gateways (relays).  In addition\n   an\
    \ international email user support group should be organized.  The\n   target\
    \ would be to achieve, within one year, routine expectation of\n   proper and\
    \ timely (less than one hour campus to campus) delivery of\n   messages.  The\
    \ three year target would be to provide global directory\n   services, a return/receipt\
    \ facility, and support for privacy and\n   authenticity.\n   COMPOUND DOCUMENTS\
    \ (6.2) Hold a workshop to review the ongoing\n   compound document research and\
    \ development programmes in the two\n   regions.  One aim would be to recommend\
    \ services, based on\n   proprietary compound document email for groups using\
    \ specific\n   conforming products, for deployment within the first year.  Another\n\
    \   would be to propose work items in the NSF/DARPA and ESPRIT programmes\n  \
    \ to ensure a timely collaborative programme could start in mid-1991,\n   with\
    \ a three year target of supporting open system compound document\n   email.\n\
    \   DIRECTORY SERVICES (6.3) Initiate a formal collaboration between\n   ongoing\
    \ US and European efforts to implement and maintain the\n   relevant directory\
    \ databases.  Within the first year provide\n   effective access to existing directory\
    \ services, and coverage of\n   relevant NSF/DARPA and ESPRIT communities.  Within\
    \ three years\n   provide database maintenance tools, knowledge-based navigation\n\
    \   software, and authentication and capability-based access control\n   facilities.\n\
    \   INTERACTIVE LOGIN (6.4) Identify for which protocol suites\n   interactive\
    \ login will be supported including the provision of\n   protocol translation\
    \ facilities.  Within one year identify and\n   install the best available interactive\
    \ software at all interested\n   sites.  Develop a cooperative effort on authentication\
    \ and privacy\n   support, to provide such facilities within three years, together\
    \ with\n   support for \"type of service\", and remote X-windows even through\n\
    \   different protocol suites.\n   FILE SERVICES (6.5) Identify and deploy within\
    \ one year the best\n   available products for double-hop (staged) multi-megabyte\
    \ file\n   transfer.  Within three years define and obtain or develop multi-\n\
    \   protocol facilities with automated staging, security and management\n   facilities;\
    \ develop access control models, policies and mechanisms to\n   support collaborative\
    \ file access by ad hoc groups.\n   GROUP COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES (6.6) Form a\
    \ support/working group on\n   the use of tools, standards and facilities for\
    \ group communication\n   services; set up a working group to harmonize current\
    \ development\n   activities in group communications with the aim of early deployment;\n\
    \   hold a workshop to propose a harmonized programme of work in the\n   future\
    \ programmes of ESPRIT and DARPA/NSF.  The one year target is to\n   provide administrative\
    \ support for maintaining email mailing lists,\n   bulletin boards and shared\
    \ databases, and to deploy facilities for\n   multi-site interactive blackboards.\
    \  The main three year target is to\n   provide intercontinental services based\
    \ on mature \"advanced\n   groupware\" facilities.\n   VIDEO CONFERENCING (6.7)\
    \ Within a year install existing technology at\n   a limited number of sites in\
    \ both regions; within three years extend\n   these, probably according to international\
    \ standards, to have enough\n   sites to be available without undue travel; organize\
    \ a workshop on\n   packet/ISDN/ATM video conferencing.\n   COMPUTER SUPPORTED\
    \ COLLABORATIVE GROUP WORKING (6.8 and 7) Set up a\n   workshop to study the needs\
    \ of a collaborative effort to provide\n   intercontinental packet video, multimedia\
    \ conferencing and computer\n   supported collaborative group technology facilities.\
    \  The workshop\n   should, within a year, propose actions which could be made\
    \ the basis\n   of a future harmonized ESPRIT and DARPA/NSF work program.  Within\n\
    \   three years set up a transatlantic testbed facility to support\n   collaborative\
    \ research programs.\n   ACCESS TO UNIQUE RESOURCES (6.9) Organize a workshop\
    \ dedicated to\n   analysing the needs, and defining the steps required, to provide\n\
    \   pilot access to one or more specific such resources - with due\n   attention\
    \ to networking needs, security provisions, documentation and\n   advisory requirements,\
    \ and usage policies.  This is to be done within\n   a year - within three years\
    \ one or more significant transatlantic\n   pilots should be set up demonstrating\
    \ remote secured access.\n   DISTRIBUTED VISUALIZATION (6.10) A working group\
    \ should be set up to\n   select which current development efforts in distributed\
    \ visualization\n   to support, identify required standards and begin to distribute\n\
    \   techniques and software, all within a year.  Its year 3 target should\n  \
    \ be to establish mutually agreed upon standards and demonstrate\n   transatlantic\
    \ distributed visualization applications.\n   NETWORK MANAGEMENT (6.11) Convene\
    \ an international research network\n   operations, planning and management team\
    \ to develop and apply\n   procedural and technical recommendations for international\
    \ network\n   management; organize a set of international network operations\n\
    \   centers devoted to configuration management, fault detection,\n   isolation\
    \ and repair of network problems; form one or more\n   intercontinental Computer\
    \ Emergency Response Teams to coordinate\n   response to attacks against hosts\
    \ and networks and to develop\n   procedures for collecting actionable evidence.\
    \  Within one year put\n   in place an administrative structure to coordinate\
    \ existing\n   facilities manually and to plan technical solutions; within three\n\
    \   years technology for automating international network management\n   should\
    \ have been developed and deployed.\n   MULTI-PROTOCOL SUPPORT (6.12) Validate\
    \ current multi-protocol\n   solutions, with a one year target of supporting campus-to-campus\n\
    \   communication for a subset of coexisting protocol suites (at least\n   OSI\
    \ and TCP/IP), and of deploying internationally supported versions\n   of existing\
    \ application level (protocol-translating) gateways;\n   collaborate on research\
    \ and experimentation with multi-protocol\n   routing and resource allocation;\
    \ make recommendations, to funders and\n   national research network service providers,\
    \ on technical solutions\n   and standards for multi-protocol support.  Within\
    \ three years deploy\n   improved management and resource allocation facilities\
    \ for multi-\n   protocol routers in order to provide service guarantees.\n  \
    \ CLIENT-SERVER FACILITIES (6.13) Within one year provide limited\n   bandwidth\
    \ intercontinental X-windows, and convene workshops to\n   achieve agreements\
    \ on Remote Procedure Call and Intercontinental\n   Distributed File System protocols;\
    \ form a working group on support\n   for X-Windows in OSI and to validate performance\
    \ through TCP/TPn\n   protocol translating gateways; initiate collaboration on\n\
    \   implementation and test of intercontinental RPC and distributed file\n   systems.\
    \  The main three year target is to achieve support for\n   intercontinental RPC\
    \ and Distributed File Systems.\n   ARCHIVAL STORAGE FOR DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING\
    \ ENVIRONMENTS (6.14)\n   Convene an international workshop whose goals are to\
    \ ascertain the\n   relevance to this group of the data storage reference model\
    \ that is\n   nearly ready to be declared an official standard guide; to carry\
    \ out\n   an on-going discussion of the system issues that have to be developed\n\
    \   as a result of this model; to arrive at solutions to be proposed by\n   vendors\
    \ and users for implementations of Data Systems Storage\n   Solutions which are\
    \ modular, interconnectable, and standard.\n   DATA REPRESENTATION AND EXCHANGE\
    \ (6.15) It is proposed that an\n   international working group be established\
    \ to recommend a standard\n   collection of software encompassing a variety of\
    \ data\n   representations.  This working group should address the issue of data\n\
    \   identification embedded in the data stream to allow for later\n   extensions.\
    \  After an initial planning meeting, the group would\n   schedule subsequent\
    \ meetings annually to finalise the current data\n   exchange standard recommendation,\
    \ and to define new work scopes.  The\n   working group would also make their\
    \ recommendation known to other\n   standards bodies.\n   TRANSATLANTIC AND CONTINENTAL\
    \ DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES (6.16) This\n   item is put last only because it is\
    \ a corollary of the preceding\n   recommendations.  Use existing joint US/European\
    \ coordination\n   mechanisms (e.g., CCIRN) for planning of higher speed, transatlantic\n\
    \   links; convene a special CEC/DARPA/NSF task force to consider much\n   higher\
    \ speed transatlantic capacity sharing options; ensure that\n   there is an infrastructure\
    \ in Europe paralleling the US one of\n   providing the majority of relevant campuses\
    \ access at speeds\n   approaching 1.5 Mb/s; encourage European user groups with\
    \ high data\n   transmission requirements to aggregate their data transmission\n\
    \   facilities; attempt to integrate European application projects (like\n   the\
    \ RACE Applications Pilots) to assist in providing an appropriate\n   European\
    \ distribution network with 10-500 Mb/s access to appropriate\n   campuses.  The\
    \ one year targets are to install 2 Mb/s multi-protocol\n   distribution facilities\
    \ in Europe, and 1.5 Mb/s (or higher)\n   transatlantic capacity.  The three year\
    \ targets are to install 2\n   additional 1.5 Mb/s (or higher) transatlantic links,\
    \ and to determine\n   the feasibility of sharing much higher bandwidth transatlantic\
    \ links.\n"

  - "1.  INTRODUCTION\n   The Networks and Infrastructure Working Group (NIWG) attempted\
    \ to\n   synthesize requirements and identify potential cooperative\n   development\
    \ efforts for network-based capabilities both by internal\n   discussion within\
    \ the working group and through interaction with the\n   other working groups\
    \ in the workshop.\n   It is essential for the facilities supporting DARPA/NSF-ESPRIT\n\
    \   collaboration to be consistent with services being used by the US and\n  \
    \ European projects for their own internal collaboration.  We have,\n   therefore,\
    \ had to consider both what facilities must be available in\n   the two regions\
    \ separately and then what must be done to facilitate\n   US-European collaboration.\n\
    \   Between the US and Europe, the Coordinating Committee for\n   Intercontinental\
    \ Research Networks (CCIRN) is addressing the\n   improvement of coordination\
    \ of network services.  To support US\n   DARPA/NSF and ESPRIT collaboration,\
    \ it will be necessary to extend\n   the use of network services in each region\
    \ as well as to improve the\n   quality of services linking the regions.\n   The\
    \ NIWG met both in Brussels and in Washington.  It was led by Ira\n   Richer (DARPA)\
    \ and Rolf Speth (CEC) in Brussels, and Tom Weber (NSF)\n   and Rosalie Zobel\
    \ (CEC) in Washington.  The participants were largely\n   different in the two\
    \ meetings, but it was agreed that there would be\n   a common set of minutes.\
    \  It is a commentary on the quality of the\n   infrastructure available to some\
    \ of the participants that nine\n   people, from both sides of the Atlantic, contributed\
    \ to these minutes\n   over five days - all by email.  The participants are listed\
    \ in\n   Appendix A; a complete set of addresses (including telephone,\n   facsimile\
    \ and email) are given in Appendix B.  Because many of the\n   abbreviations used\

    \ on generic,\n   network-based user services considered helpful for a wide range\
    \ of\n   collaborative work between US and European groups.  We distinguished\n\
    \   between the capabilities which would benefit from immediate attention\n  \
    \ or were required in the short term (e.g., within a year), and those\n   which\
    \ required longer term development.  While the prescribed scope\n   was to act\
    \ only in support of the other groups by making use of\n   available technology,\
    \ we identified one area where we felt more\n   research and development was an\
    \ important adjunct to our scope.\n   The working group agreed that the major\
    \ objectives, based on\n   instructions given in the opening plenary sessions,\
    \ were to identify\n   the following:\n   (i)   user requirements which must be\
    \ satisfied to support\n         cooperative US/European research;\n   (ii)  technical\
    \ and other infrastructure requirements which must be\n         satisfied to support\
    \ cooperative US/European research;\n   (iii) opportunities and potential means\
    \ for satisfying these\n         requirements;\n   (iv)  potential obstacles to\
    \ achieving the desired support;\n   (v)   mutual benefits which would accrue\
    \ to the participants in\n         recommended cooperative projects;\n   (vi)\
    \  promising collaborative development activities needed for\n         a better\
    \ infrastructure.\n"

    \ networking, by its very nature, requires cooperation and\n   collaboration among\
    \ the participants developing, implementing,\n   deploying and operating the hardware\
    \ and software comprising the\n   system.  The long-term vision is the creation\
    \ of an infrastructure\n   which provides the user (rather than the network) with\
    \ a distributed\n   multi-vendor heterogeneous computing environment - with transatlantic\n\
    \   facilities approaching those available locally.\n   A major element of successful\
    \ networking is the agreement on\n   standards which are to be met by all systems\
    \ included in the network.\n   Beyond technical agreements, there must also be\
    \ concurrence on\n   operational procedures, performance objectives, support for\
    \ the users\n   of the network and ability to plan for enhancement and growth\
    \ of\n   network services.\n   A consequence of these observations is that virtually\
    \ any effort to\n   provide network service support to ESPRIT-DARPA/NSF collaboration\n\
    \   should be carried out cooperatively between the US and European\n   network\
    \ research, design, development, engineering and operations\n   communities.\n"
- title: 4.  CURRENT STATE OF NETWORKING IN THE US AND EUROPE
  contents:
  - "4.  CURRENT STATE OF NETWORKING IN THE US AND EUROPE\n   In the DARPA/NSF communities,\
    \ there is heavy use of electronic mail\n   and computer networking to support\
    \ a wide range of scientific\n   research.  There is heavy use of the TCP/IP and\
    \ DECNET protocols as\n   well as special electronic mail protocols in the BITNET\
    \ and Unix\n   users networks (e.g., UUNET).  Email use varies in intensity among\n\
    \   different research disciplines.\n   There is an emerging interest in and use\
    \ of OSI-based protocols,\n   particularly for email (X.400) and directory services\
    \ (X.500).  Most\n   of the backbone networks making up the Internet use 1.5 Mb/s\n\
    \   telecommunications facilities although the NSFNET will be installing\n   a\
    \ high speed, 45 Mb/s subnetwork during 1990.  There are many Local\n   Area Networks\
    \ (LANs).  Plans are in place to support both IP (as in\n   TCP/IP) and CLNP (as\
    \ in OSI) datagram protocols in backbone and\n   regional networks.  Most of these\
    \ protocols are already supported on\n   LANs.  On a selective research basis,\
    \ a set of 1000 Mb/s research\n   testbeds are being installed during 1990-1993.\n\
    \   In Europe, especially amongst the ESPRIT collaborators, there is more\n  \
    \ limited use of computer networking, with the primary emphasis on the\n   use\
    \ of electronic mail and bulletin boards.  There is a strong focus\n   on OSI\
    \ protocols in European wide-area networks, but there is a\n   considerably amount\
    \ of TCP/IP use on LANs, and growing use of TCP/IP\n   in Wide Area Networks (WANs)\
    \ in some countries.  Most of the national\n   wide-area networks are based on\
    \ the CCITT X.25 protocols with access\n   speeds up to 64 Kb/s, though higher\
    \ access speeds in the 2 Mb/s range\n   are planned for many countries, and just\
    \ becoming available in some.\n   An X.25 international backbone (IXI) has just\
    \ become operational,\n   which connects in the National Research Networks and/or\
    \ the Public\n   Packet Data Networks in each Western Europe country at 64 Kb/s.\
    \  The\n   funding of this network has only been agreed for a further short\n\
    \   period, and plans to upgrade it to higher speed access are not\n   agreed.\
    \  There are many LANs in place.  The OSI connection-oriented\n   network service\
    \ (CONS) is layered above X.25, but there is growing\n   interest in supporting\
    \ the connectionless service (CLNS) concurrently\n   with the Internet IP in national\
    \ and international backbone networks.\n   Application testbeds at higher speeds\
    \ are planned under the CEC RACE\n   programme.  Many of its higher level user\
    \ services have not been\n   specified collaboratively - as would be required\
    \ for wide deployment.\n   These points are explained further in Section 6.\n\
    \   Thus although provisions or plans regarding National networks in some\n  \
    \ CEC member states are not so far behind the American facilities, one\n   must\
    \ note that in effect, because of continental backbone\n   limitations, Pan-European\
    \ facilities are at least a generation\n   behind.  Specifically, both with respect\
    \ to existing and planned\n   backbone provisions, there is a factor of 25 difference\
    \ between\n   Europe and the USA.  In addition, this approximate comparison\n\
    \   flatters the European scene, since it compares facilities that are\n   just\
    \ coming into existence, and plans that are not yet agreed or\n   funded, on the\
    \ European side with facilities that have been available\n   for some time, and\
    \ plans that will be realised before the end of this\n   year, in the USA.\n"
- title: 5.  POLLS OF THE OTHER WORKING GROUPS
  contents:
  - "5.  POLLS OF THE OTHER WORKING GROUPS\n   The NIWG polled the other seven working\
    \ groups meeting in Brussels\n   and Washington to find out what networking and\
    \ infrastructure support\n   their collaborations might require.  In general,\
    \ a strong emphasis\n   was placed on the provision of reliable and timely email,\
    \ easier\n   accessibility of email service, user support and information on\n\
    \   existence and use of available services.  There was serious concern\n   about\
    \ privacy, and great interest in transparency (i.e., hiding the\n   details of\
    \ intercontinental networking).\n   Some users mentioned that FAX was easier to\
    \ use and apparently more\n   ubiquitous than email for their communities (there\
    \ are over 12 M\n   facsimile machines installed world-wide).  Interest in integrating\n\
    \   FAX and email was noticeable.  Most users recognised the many\n   advantages\
    \ of email for multiple addressees, subsequent reprocessing,\n   relaying and\
    \ cost.\n   The requirement for large file transfer was patchy.  Many did not\n\
    \   require such facilities, but several groups required transfer of 100\n   MB\
    \ files and some even 1 GB.  Many groups desired remote log-in, but\n   found\
    \ present performance - even on the Internet - inadequate.\n   Several wanted\
    \ global file services and file sharing.\n   Many groups wished to use video conferencing\
    \ - but only if they did\n   not have to travel more than two hours to a suitable\
    \ facility.  Some\n   groups were interested in computer supported group collaboration\
    \ -\n   but most did not understand this term.\n   One group (Vision) desired\
    \ real time transfer at 300 Mb/s, but most\n   had much more modest user-user\
    \ needs.  The needs for less visible\n   features like network management, client-user\
    \ technology, remote\n   visualization standards and data representation and exchange\
    \ formats\n   were not voiced explicitly.  However they could be deduced from\
    \ the\n   services which the users did request.\n"
- title: 6. USER SERVICES NEEDED IN THE SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM
  contents:
  - "6. USER SERVICES NEEDED IN THE SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM\n   To support collaboration\
    \ between the research workers, we need a\n   number of services between the end\
    \ users.  These require provisions\n   which impinge on many management domains:\
    \ inside individual campuses;\n   campus-wide area gateways; national distribution;\
    \ regional-\n   intercontinental gateways; intercontinental distribution.  However,\n\
    \   from the users' viewpoint, this set of services should constitute a\n   system\
    \ whose internal details are not, or at least should not, be of\n   concern. \
    \ It is the overall performance and reliability exhibited,\n   and the facilities\
    \ made available to the user (and their cost), which\n   matter.  Inadequacies\
    \ of bandwidth, protocols, or administrative\n   support anywhere in the chain\
    \ between the end users are, to them,\n   inadequacies in the system as a whole.\n\
    \   To some extent more funding from DARPA/NSF and the CEC can alleviate\n   the\
    \ current difficulties.  However it is likely that such funding\n   will impact\
    \ only the international and intercontinental components.\n   It is essential\
    \ that the end-user distribution be strengthened also.\n   In the US this requires\
    \ both Regional and Campus Networks.  In\n   Europe, it requires activity by the\
    \ National network authorities\n   (usually represented in RARE and/or COSINE),\
    \ and by the Campus\n   network providers.  Moreover, not only must the transmission\n\
    \   facilities be strengthened, but also the appropriate protocol suites\n   must\
    \ be supported; this may require policy decisions as well as\n   technical measures.\n\
    \   We indicate below the services which are required immediately, and\n   are\
    \ visible to the end-users.  They often have implications to the\n   service providers\
    \ which have far-reaching consequences.  Some of the\n   services are urgent user\
    \ services; some are underpinning requirements\n   needed to assure the user services;\
    \ some are longer term needs.\n   There is clearly a strong interaction between\
    \ the user services and\n   the underpinning ones; there is also some between\
    \ the user services\n   themselves.  Partly as a result of our own deliberations,\
    \ and partly\n   as a result of our polls of the other working groups, we have\n\
    \   identified needs in the areas below.\n"

    \   requiring translation) and in part from an inadequate operations and\n   maintenance\
    \ infrastructure.  There are few user and directory support\n   services available;\
    \ access to, and use of, email service varies\n   dramatically.  However, some\

  - "6.13  Client-Server Technology\n   Among the more important computer communications\
    \ techniques emerging\n   on a widespread basis during the last decade is the\
    \ client-server\n   model of interprocess communication.  This notion was actually\n\
    \   developed during the earliest stages of packet network exploration\n   and\
    \ dramatically enhanced with the invention of local area networks\n   (such as\
    \ Ethernet) which could support very high speed, low delay\n   inter-computer\
    \ exchanges.  Applications of this concept range from\n   remote procedure calls\
    \ to remote file access and support for remote,\n   bit-mapped graphics.\n   At\
    \ present, these techniques work best in a high bandwidth, low delay\n   environment;\
    \ they are generally not well-supported in wide-area,\n   intercontinental networks.\
    \  Collaborative efforts between the US and\n   Europe could be enhanced substantially\
    \ by support for client-server\n   services on an intercontinental basis.  Such\
    \ facilities would permit\n   collaborative use of distributed filing systems,\
    \ X-windows\n   applications and other distributed computing applications.  High\n\
    \   capacity, low-delay channels will be needed on an intercontinental\n   basis\
    \ to support serious use of this technology.  In addition,\n   agreement must\
    \ be reached on which protocols should be used to\n   support this technology.\n"

- title: Section 6.14   Archival Storage for Distributed Computing Environments
  contents:
  - "Section 6.14   Archival Storage for Distributed Computing Environments\n   There\
    \ are several major issues that must be addressed by distributed\n   computing\
    \ environments (DCEs) containing supercomputers.  Resolution\n   of these issues\
    \ is likely to evolve over the next five to ten years.\n   One such issue is archival\
    \ storage and bitfile management for the\n   complete environment.  Several problems\
    \ have to be resolved to\n   appropriately handle this situation.  The first problem\
    \ is the\n   global-naming of bitfiles that are being moved through the DCE\n\
    \   to/from the archive.  Second, the file system hierarchy must be\n   defined.\
    \  Third, there is the question of how the DCE knows the file\n   system hierarchy\
    \ for which it is responsible, and the location of the\n   boundary through which\
    \ the network and the archival system operate.\n   Lastly, there is the question\
    \ how the file system hierarchy is\n   divided across a DCE and within a supercomputer.\n\
    \   A second issue in the DCE is the need for all nodes obtaining or\n   storing\
    \ data to know the storage media differences.  For future\n   systems, this requirement\
    \ manifests itself both at the distributed\n   nodes and at the supercomputer\
    \ because of the differences in the\n   physical media structure.\n   The third\
    \ issue is the delineation of the bitfile attributes.  This\n   relates to how\
    \ the data must be maintained as it migrates through the\n   hierarchy, as well\
    \ as through the DCE.  The bitfile carries\n   attributes based upon its location\
    \ in the hierarchy, or in the DCE,\n   that may be different from those needed\
    \ at the supercomputer level.\n   Many of these attributes are related to the\
    \ data content and where it\n   resides in time within the DCE.  Section 6.15\
    \ discusses some of the\n   possible meta-data representation methodologies that\
    \ may be used but\n   are not yet standardized.\n   Another issue is the determination\
    \ and implementation of the site\n   policy that is to dictate data migration\
    \ and allocation inside the\n   DCE archival storage system.\n   Several working\
    \ committees are attacking the various problems\n   delineated above, and are\
    \ trying to confront the difficulties in\n   these environments.  This work is\
    \ progressing mostly in the United\n   States.  The IEEE Computer Society Technical\
    \ Committee on Mass\n   Storage Systems is in the process of developing a Computer\
    \ Society\n   draft standard on data storage systems.  The current working draft\n\
    \   provides a consistent terminology and an object-oriented design for\n   defining\
    \ storage subsystem components, whether they are being built\n   around a single\
    \ system or in a DCE.  Other groups in the computing\n   community are currently\
    \ dealing with the problems of data migration\n   within a distributed environment.\
    \  This distributed environment may\n   or may not include a supercomputer, but\
    \ it almost always includes a\n   high-volume storage system of some sort delineated\
    \ as a \"mass storage\n   system.\" This subject was not discussed long enough\
    \ at the meeting to\n   deduce one year or three year targets - indeed these may\
    \ well be set\n   by the relevant National working groups.\n"

- title: 6.15  Data Representation and Exchange
  contents:
  - "6.15  Data Representation and Exchange\n   The problem of data exchange between\
    \ different computer architectures\n   and operating systems has been existent\
    \ since the deployment of the\n   early computers.  This problem has been exacerbated\
    \ by the acceptance\n   of the client-server paradigm as the provider of distributed\n\
    \   services.  Distributed computer services require immediate data\n   exchange.\
    \  In the past, data was exchanged on some medium, such as\n   tape, and could\
    \ be examined at leisure.  Ad hoc data conversion\n   routines were created to\
    \ process the data, and were often embedded in\n   the programs using the data.\
    \  Data exchange in the client-server\n   paradigm does not permit this leisurely\
    \ data examination.  Both the\n   client and the server must be able to \"call\"\
    \ software that is\n   guaranteed to convert the exchanged data \"on the spot.\"\
    \  This\n   guarantee also implies a standard format rather than the ability to\n\
    \   convert all formats because it would be impossible to maintain\n   multiple\
    \ architecture conversion software and, of course, the size of\n   such conversion\
    \ software would be enormous.\n   The issue of data exchange has been addressed\
    \ resulting in many data\n   exchange software packages.  A few of the currently\
    \ more popular\n   packages are XDR, HDF, NetCDF, PostScript and CCSDS.  Each\
    \ of these\n   packages addresses a specific type of data.  Some address bitmap\n\
    \   data; one addresses the general encoding of \"display\" information.\n   Some\
    \ of these packages address various numerical representations in\n   computers.\
    \  It is unclear whether any existing package could or\n   should be extended\
    \ to solve all data exchange problems.  However, a\n   more realistic approach\
    \ would be a collection of data exchange\n   packages formed as the \"standard.\"\
    \n   This item was discussed only briefly at the meeting, so that no one\n   year\
    \ or three year targets were specified.\n"

- title: 8.  OBSTACLES
  contents:
  - "8.  OBSTACLES\n   The largest single obstacle to the provision of the facilities\n\
    \   outlined in this report are that development of the necessary\n   facilities\
    \ do not have priority to most funding agencies.  This is\n   exemplified by the\
    \ role of our workshops in this series.  Not only\n   network provision, but also\
    \ development of appropriate infrastructure\n   application software and testbed\
    \ activity, are essential.\n   There are a number of problem areas which could\
    \ benefit from official\n   attention from CEC and US research funding agencies.\
    \  For example,\n   there are a number of open and proprietary protocol suites\
    \ which are\n   candidates for use in US/European collaborative research.  However,\n\
    \   there is lack of political agreement as to how to deal with these\n   various\
    \ suites.  It would be politically valuable if the CEC and US\n   research agencies\
    \ could issue a communique outlining common agreement\n   on treatment of multiple\
    \ protocols (e.g., expressing serious interest\n   in supporting campus-to-campus\
    \ communication using multiple\n   protocols).  Within the OSI protocol suite,\
    \ there are differences as\n   to which features ought to make up the standard\
    \ profile for use by\n   government-sponsored groups.  Handling of connection-oriented\
    \ and\n   connectionless protocol elements within the suite is the subject of\n\
    \   continued debate.  Agreement to support at least TCP/IP and the\n   connectionless\
    \ network protocol in the OSI suite on an\n   intercontinental basis would be\
    \ beneficial to both parties; many CEC\n   members would like connection-oriented\
    \ network protocols to be\n   supported also.\n   European international tariffs\
    \ are relatively high.  This has\n   inhibited the implementation of private networks\
    \ and impeded progress\n   on collaborative work between the US and Europe.  A\
    \ CEC initiative to\n   come to grips with this problem could be quite helpful.\n\
    \   There are a diversity of intra-European networking organizations\n   which\
    \ have technical, operational and policy interests.  Planning for\n   intercontinental\
    \ networking infrastructure is sometimes confused by\n   the variety of interested\
    \ parties.  Effort towards further\n   coordination and rationalization of intra-European\
    \ networking\n   activities could make intercontinental planning somewhat easier.\n\
    \   There is a strong interest in the use of cryptographic methods to\n   provide\
    \ privacy, authenticity and integrity assurance for various\n   forms of intercontinental\
    \ communication and at various levels in the\n   protocol hierarchies.  Although\
    \ there appears to be substantial\n   technical activity in this area, progress\
    \ is now impeded by national\n   restrictions on the export of software which\
    \ utilizes cryptographic\n   methods.  National use policies vary and the ability\
    \ to apply these\n   valuable and needed techniques is uncertain.\n   Some national\
    \ privacy and data protection laws prohibit the creation\n   of directories containing\
    \ personal information (e.g., email and\n   postal addresses) and other laws limit\
    \ what kinds of information (and\n   in what form) can be transported across national\
    \ borders.\n   Handling of cryptographic exchanges, import/export of supporting\n\
    \   software and exchanges of keying information are all potentially\n   subject\
    \ to national restrictions and constraints.  The government\n   agencies interested\
    \ in promoting international collaboration may need\n   to seek alternative international\
    \ formulations of permitted practice\n   to permit the required technical support.\n\
    \   Finally, several organizations in the US and Europe have pointed out\n   that\
    \ the provision of networking infrastructure requires stable\n   funding over\
    \ significant periods of time.  Stability for\n   infrastructure support has been\
    \ shaky in the US and in Europe and\n   this presents an obstacle to achieving\
    \ widespread and reliable\n   network services to aid collaborative efforts.\n"

  - "APPENDIX C GLOSSARY\n   There is no attempt to provide a comprehensive glossary.\
    \  However,\n   some of the participants were unfamiliar with the terms used on\
    \ the\n   other side of the Atlantic, so some of the more parochial technical\n\
    \   terms are defined below.\n   CCITT - The international body responsible for\
    \ recommendations\n        to the National communications authorities.\n   CLNP\
    \ - Connectionless Network Protocol.  A specific ISO/OSI\n        protocol analgous\
    \ to the IP mentioned below.\n   CONS - Connection-oriented service.  Another\
    \ specific ISO/OSI\n        protocol more aligned to the X.25 protocol mentioned\
    \ below.\n   Compound Document - Documents containing different content types\n\
    \        including some of the following: text (possibly with various\n      \
    \  fonts), geometric graphics, bit-map graphics, spreadsheets,\n        tables,\
    \ animation, voice  annotation.\n   IAB - The Internet Activities Board.  This\
    \ is the body which\n        guides the evolution of the TCP/IP protocol suite\
    \ and the\n        general Internet architecture.  The Internet Engineering Task\n\
    \        Force and Internet Research Task Force are subsidiary\n        activities\
    \ of the IAB.\n   IETF - The Internet Engineering Task Force.  This is a working\n\
    \        group responsible for the specification, development and\n        discussion\
    \ of the operation of facilities in the Internet\n        research networks, which\
    \ are the basis of US research network\n        services - but also have European\
    \ counterparts and\n        participation.\n   Internet - The concatenations of\
    \ packet-switched networks which\n        comprise the research networks used\
    \ by most of the contractors\n        of the NSF and DARPA (amonsgst other US\
    \ groups).  The Internet\n        also extends to other countries including some\
    \ in Europe.\n   IP - The Internet Protocol.  This is the lowest level protocol\
    \ which\n        is the basis of the current Internet.\n   ISO - The International\
    \ Standards Organisation.  The international\n        organisation responsible\
    \ for the standardisation of a broad\n        range of facilities including network\
    \ ones.\n   IXI - The international packet switched network which has been\n \
    \       installed by the European communication authorities as part\n        of\
    \ a European project to provide an international backbone\n        network linking\
    \ in the West European National research (and\n        public) networks.\n   OSI\
    \ - Open Systems Interconnection.  An evolving set of ISO\n        standards which\
    \ should allow services on different host\n        computers networks to inter-operate.\n\
    \   RARE - The international committee comprising representatives of\n       \
    \ European National and international research networks.\n   TCP/IP - The transport\
    \ protocols currently used on the Internet.\n   X.25 - The Network Access protocols\
    \ specified by CCITT/OSI as\n        standard.\n   X.400 - The set of protocols\
    \ for message services specified by\n        CCITT/ISO.\n   X.500 - The set of\
    \ protocols for directory services specified by\n        CCITT/ISO.\n"
