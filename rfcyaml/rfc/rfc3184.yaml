  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document provides a set of guidelines for personal interaction\n\
    \   in the Internet Engineering Task Force.  The Guidelines recognize the\n  \
    \ diversity of IETF participants, emphasize the value of mutual\n   respect, and\
    \ stress the broad applicability of our work.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The work of the IETF relies on cooperation among a broad\
    \ cultural\n   diversity of peoples, ideas, and communication styles.  The\n \
    \  Guidelines for Conduct inform our interaction as we work together to\n   develop\
    \ multiple, interoperable technologies for the Internet.  All\n   IETF participants\
    \ aim to abide by these Guidelines as we build\n   consensus in person, at IETF\
    \ meetings, and in e-mail.  If conflicts\n   arise, we resolve them according\
    \ to the procedures outlined in BCP\n   25.[1]\n"
- title: 2. Principles of Conduct
  contents:
  - "2. Principles of Conduct\n   1. IETF participants extend respect and courtesy\
    \ to their colleagues\n      at all times.\n      IETF participants come from\
    \ diverse origins and backgrounds and\n      are equipped with multiple capabilities\
    \ and ideals.  Regardless of\n      these individual differences, participants\
    \ treat their colleagues\n      with respect as persons--especially when it is\
    \ difficult to agree\n      with them.  Seeing from another's point of view is\
    \ often\n      revealing, even when it fails to be compelling.\n      English\
    \ is the de facto language of the IETF, but it is not the\n      native language\
    \ of many IETF participants.  Native English\n      speakers attempt to speak\
    \ clearly and a bit slowly and to limit\n      the use of slang in order to accommodate\
    \ the needs of all\n      listeners.\n   2. IETF participants develop and test\
    \ ideas impartially, without\n      finding fault with the colleague proposing\
    \ the idea.\n      We dispute ideas by using reasoned argument, rather than through\n\
    \      intimidation or ad hominem attack.  Or, said in a somewhat more\n     \
    \ IETF-like way:\n            \"Reduce the heat and increase the light\"\n   3.\
    \ IETF participants think globally, devising solutions that meet the\n      needs\
    \ of diverse technical and operational environments.\n      The goal of the IETF\
    \ is to maintain and enhance a working, viable,\n      scalable, global Internet,\
    \ and the problems we encounter are\n      genuinely very difficult.  We understand\
    \ that \"scaling is the\n      ultimate problem\" and that many ideas quite workable\
    \ in the small\n      fail this crucial test.  IETF participants use their best\n\
    \      engineering judgment to find the best solution for the whole\n      Internet,\
    \ not just the best solution for any particular network,\n      technology, vendor,\
    \ or user.  We follow the intellectual property\n      guidelines outlined in\
    \ BCP 9.[2]\n   4. Individuals who attend Working Group meetings are prepared\
    \ to\n      contribute to the ongoing work of the group.\n      IETF participants\
    \ who attend Working Group meetings read the\n      relevant Internet-Drafts,\
    \ RFCs, and e-mail archives beforehand, in\n      order to familiarize themselves\
    \ with the technology under\n      discussion.  This may represent a challenge\
    \ for newcomers, as e-\n      mail archives can be difficult to locate and search,\
    \ and it may\n      not be easy to trace the history of longstanding Working Group\n\
    \      debates.  With that in mind, newcomers who attend Working Group\n     \
    \ meetings are encouraged to observe and absorb whatever material\n      they\
    \ can, but should not interfere with the ongoing process of the\n      group.\
    \  Working Group meetings run on a very limited time\n      schedule, and are\
    \ not intended for the education of individuals.\n      The work of the group\
    \ will continue on the mailing list, and many\n      questions would be better\
    \ expressed on the list in the months that\n      follow.\n"
