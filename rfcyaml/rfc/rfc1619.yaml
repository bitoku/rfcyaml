- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   PPP was designed as a standard method of communicating over\
    \ point-\n   to-point links.  Initial deployment has been over short local lines,\n\
    \   leased lines, and plain-old-telephone-service (POTS) using modems.\n   As\
    \ new packet services and higher speed lines are introduced, PPP is\n   easily\
    \ deployed in these environments as well.\n   This specification is primarily\
    \ concerned with the use of the PPP\n   encapsulation over SONET/SDH links.  Since\
    \ SONET/SDH is by definition\n   a point-to-point circuit, PPP is well suited\
    \ to use over these links.\n   The Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) [3] is\
    \ an octet-synchronous\n   multiplex scheme that defines a family of standard\
    \ rates and formats.\n   Despite the name, it is not limited to optical links.\
    \  Electrical\n   specifications have been defined for single-mode fiber, multi-mode\n\
    \   fiber, and CATV 75 ohm coaxial cable.  The transmission rates are\n   integral\
    \ multiples of 51.840 Mbps, which may be used to carry T3/E3\n   bit-synchronous\
    \ signals.  The allowed multiples are currently\n   specified as\n           STS-1\
    \    51.840         STS-18    933.120\n           STS-3   155.520         STS-24\

    \  STS-12  622.080         STS-48  2,488.320\n   The CCITT Synchronous Digital\
    \ Heirarchy (SDH) defines a subset of\n   SONET transmission rates beginning at\
    \ 155.520 Mbps [5].\n           SONET           SDH equivalent\n           STS-3c\

- title: 2.  Physical Layer Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Physical Layer Requirements\n   PPP treats SONET/SDH transport as octet oriented\
    \ synchronous links.\n   SONET/SDH links are full-duplex by definition.\n   Interface\
    \ Format\n      PPP presents an octet interface to the physical layer.  There\
    \ is\n      no provision for sub-octets to be supplied or accepted.\n      The\
    \ octet stream is mapped into the SONET/SDH Synchronous Payload\n      Envelope\
    \ (SPE), with the octet boundaries aligned with the SPE\n      octet boundaries.\n\
    \      No scrambling is needed during insertion into the SPE.\n      The Path\
    \ Signal Label (C2) is intended to indicate the contents of\n      the SPE.  The\
    \ experimental value of 207 (cf hex) is used to\n      indicate PPP.\n      The\
    \ Multiframe Indicator (H4) is currently unused, and MUST be\n      zero.\n  \
    \ Transmission Rate\n      The basic rate for PPP over SONET/SDH is that of STS-3c/STM-1\
    \ at\n      155.520 Mbps.  The available information bandwidth is 149.760\n  \
    \    Mbps, which is the STS-3c/STM-1 SPE with section, line and path\n      overhead\
    \ removed.  This is the same super-rate mapping that is\n      used for ATM and\
    \ FDDI [4].\n      Lower signal rates MUST use the Virtual Tributary (VT) mechanism\n\
    \      of SONET/SDH.  This maps existing signals up to T3/E3 rates\n      asynchronously\
    \ into the SPE, or uses available clocks for bit-\n      synchronous and byte-synchronous\
    \ mapping.\n      Higher signal rates SHOULD conform to the SDH STM series, rather\n\
    \      than the SONET STS series, as equipment becomes available.  The\n     \
    \ STM series progresses in powers of 4 (instead of 3), and employs\n      fewer\
    \ steps, which is likely to simplify multiplexing and\n      integration.\n  \
    \ Control Signals\n      PPP does not require the use of control signals.  When\
    \ available,\n      using such signals can allow greater functionality and\n \
    \     performance.  Implications are discussed in [2].\n"
- title: 3.  Framing
  contents:
  - "3.  Framing\n   The framing for octet-synchronous links is described in \"PPP\
    \ in HDLC\n   Framing\" [2].\n   The PPP frames are located by row within the\
    \ SPE payload.  Because\n   frames are variable in length, the frames are allowed\
    \ to cross SPE\n   boundaries.\n"
- title: 4.  Configuration Details
  contents:
  - "4.  Configuration Details\n   The standard LCP sync configuration defaults apply\
    \ to SONET/SDH\n   links.\n   The following Configuration Options are recommended:\n\
    \      Magic Number\n      No Address and Control Field Compression\n      No\
    \ Protocol Field Compression\n      32-bit FCS\n"
