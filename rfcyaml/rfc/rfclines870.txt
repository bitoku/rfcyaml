790, 776, 770, 762, 758, 755, 750, 739, 604, 503, 433, 349 ASSIGNED NUMBERS
This Network Working Group Request for Comments documents the currently assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.
This RFC will be updated periodically, and in any case current information can be obtained from Joyce Reynolds.
The assignment of numbers is also handled by Joyce.
If you are developing a protocol or application that will require the use of a link, socket, port, protocol, or network number please contact Joyce to receive a number assignment.
USC Information Sciences Institute 4676 Admiralty Way Marina del Rey, California
(213) 822 1511 ARPA mail: JKREYNOLDS@USC ISIF Most of the protocols mentioned here are documented in the RFC series of notes.
The more prominent and more generally used are documented in the "Internet Protocol Transition Workbook" [16] or in the old "ARPANET Protocol Handbook" [17] prepared by the NIC.
Some of the items listed are undocumented.
Further information on protocols can be found in the memo "Official Protocols" [52].
In all cases the name and mailbox of the responsible individual is indicated.
In the lists that follow, a bracketed entry, e.g., [16,iii], at the right hand margin of the page indicates a reference for the listed protocol, where the number cites the document and the "iii" cites the person.
RFC 870 Network Numbers ASSIGNED NETWORK NUMBERS
The network numbers listed here are used as internet addresses by the Internet Protocol (IP)
The IP uses a 32 bit address field and divides that address into a network part and a "rest" or local address part.
The division takes 3 forms or classes.
The first type of address, or class A, has a 7 bit network number and a 24 bit local address.
The highest order bit is set to 0.
This allows 128 class A networks.
The second type of address, class B, has a 14 bit network number and a 16 bit local address.
The two highest order bits are set to 1 0.
This allows 16,384 class B networks.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
The third type of address, class C, has a 21 bit network number and a 8 bit local address.
The three highest order bits are set to 1 1 0.
This allows 2,097,152 class C networks.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
No addresses are allowed with the three highest order bits set to 1 1 1.
These addresses (sometimes called "class D") are reserved.
RFC 870 Network Numbers One commonly used notation for internet host addresses divides the 32 bit address into four 8 bit fields and specifies the value of each field as a decimal number with the fields separated by periods.
This is called the "dotted decimal" notation.
For example, the internet address of ISIF in dotted decimal is 010.002.000.052, or 10.2.0.52.
The dotted decimal notation will be used in the listing of assigned network numbers.
A networks will have nnn.rrr.rrr.rrr, the class B networks will have nnn.nnn.rrr.rrr, and the class C networks will have nnn.nnn.nnn.rrr, where nnn represents part or all of a network number and rrr represents part or all of a local address.
There are three catagories of users of Internet Addresses: Research, Defense, and Commercial.
To reflect the allocation of network identifiers among the categories, a one character code is placed to the left of the network number (in the column marked by an asterisk): R for Research and Development, D for DoD, and C for Commercial.
Numbers assigned for commercial use of IP family protocols, but not for interworking with the ARPA or DoD Internets are marked with an astrisk preceeding the number.
For various reasons, the assigned numbers of networks are sometimes changed.
To ease the transition the old number will be listed as well.
These "old number" entries will be marked with a "T" following the number and preceeding the name, and the network name will be the suffixed " TEMP".

In the Internet Protocol (IP)
[16,47] there is a field, called Protocol, to identify the the next level protocol.
This is an 8 bit field.
RFC 870 Port Numbers ASSIGNED
PORT NUMBERS Ports are used in the TCP [16,48] to name the ends of logical connections which carry long term conversations.
For the purpose of providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is defined.
This list specifies the port used by the server process as its contact port.
The contact port is sometimes called the "well known port".
To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the UDP [16,46].
The assigned ports use a small portion of the possible port numbers.
The assigned ports have all except the low order eight bits cleared to zero.
The low order eight bits are specified here.

RFC 870 Autonomous System Numbers ASSIGNED AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM
The Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) [53] specifies that groups of gateways may form autonomous systems.
The EGP provides a 16 bit field for identifying such systems.
The values of this field are registered here.
ARPANET Link Numbers ASSIGNED ARPANET LINK
The word "link" here refers to a field in the original ARPANET Host/IMP interface leader.
The link was originally defined as an 8 bit field.
Later specifications defined this field as the "Message ID" with a length of 12 bits.
The name link now refers to the high order 8 bits of this 12 bit message id field.
The low order 4 bits of the message id field are to be zero unless explicitly specified otherwise for the particular protocol used on that link.
The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN Report 1822 [2].

This appendix summarizes the agreements reached by the DDN/PMO and DARPA at a September 1982 meeting concerning the allocation and assignment of the various numbers associated with DoD Protocol Standards and the DARPA Experimental Standards.
Recommended policy is summarized for each type of number assignment of concern:
Network Identifiers used by the Internet Protocol It is recommended that the available number spaces for class A, B, and C network addresses be allocated among R&D, DoD and commercial uses, and that assignments of these addresses be the responsibility respectively of DARPA, DCA PCCO/DDN and the National Bureau of Standards.
The recommended allocations are given below.
Class A (highest order bit 0)
Reserved Addresses:  0,16383 Class C (highest order bits 1 1 0)
Reserved Addresses:  0,2097151 Class D (highest order bits 1 1 1)
All addresses in this class are reserved for future use, possibly in support of multicast services.
They should be allocated to R&D use for the present.
Within the R&D community, it will be the policy that network identifiers will only be granted to applicants who show evidence that they are acquiring standard Bolt Beranek and Newman gateway software or have implemented or are acquiring a gateway meeting the Exterior Gateway Protocol requirements.
Acquisition of the Berkeley BSD 4.2 UNIX software might be considered evidence of the latter.
Experimental networks which later become operational need not be renumbered.
Rather, the identifiers could be moved from R&D to DoD or Commercial status.
Thus, network identifiers may change state among R&D, DoD and commercial, but the number of identifiers allocated to each use should remain within the limits indicated above.
To make possible this fluid assignment, it is recommended that the network identifier spaces not be allocated by simple partition but rather by specific assignment.
In general, all assignments will be made by the R&D community, but any numbers which become R&D, DoD, national or international standards will be marked as such in this RFC.
Protocol identifiers 0 and 255 are reserved.
95 protocol identifiers are allocated for assignment to DoD standards, 32 for R&D use, and 127 for Commercial, national or international standards.
Port Numbers A recommendation for allocation and assignment of port numbers is to be developed jointly by representatives of the ICCB and PSTP.
All unnecessary link number usage will be eliminated by joint effort of the ICCB, PSTP and BBN.
BBN will give consideration to the use of link numbers to promote interoperability among various ARPANET interfaces and report to the ICCB, PSTP and DDN/PMO.
Examples of possible interoperability issues are: (i)
interoperability of 1822 and X.25 interfaces (ii)
interoperability of SIP and other interfaces (iii) logical addressing or other special services
RFC 870 APPENDIX A IP Version Numbers
These numbers will be assigned only by the R&D community for the purpose of exploring alternatives in internet protocol service expansion, such as inclusion of stream protocol (ST) services.
TCP, IP and Telnet Option Identifiers
These numbers will be assigned by the R&D community.
Any permanent or experimental assignments will be identified in the documents specifying those protcols.
This policy recommendation has not been fully implemented as yet.
Currently, Joyce Reynolds is acting coordinator for all number assignments.
