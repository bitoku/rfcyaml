    \ Laboratories\n                       18 April 1981\nIntroduction\n     Following\
    \  is  a  description  of  the  Internet  Clock\nService  (ICS)  provided  by\
    \  all DCNET hosts.  The service,\nintended primarily for  clock  synchronization\
    \  and  one-way\ndelay  measurements  with  cooperating  internet  hosts,  is\n\
    provided using the Timestamp and Timestamp Reply messages of\nthe  proposed  Internet\
    \ Control Message Protocol (ICMP).  In\naddition, in order to maintain  compatability\
    \  with  present\nsystems,  this  service  will be provided for a limited time\n\
    using  the   Echo   and   Echo   Reply   messages   of   the\nGateway-Gateway\
    \ Protocol (GGP).\n     It should be understood that ICMP and GGP datagrams are\n\
    normally  considered  tightly bound to the Internet Protocol\n(IP) itself and\
    \ not directly accessable to  the  user  on  a\nTOPS-20  system,  for  example.\
    \  These datagrams are treated\nsomewhat differently from user  datagrams  in\
    \  gateways  and\nDCNET hosts in that certain internal queueing mechanisms are\n\
    bypassed.  Thus, they can be a useful tool in providing  the\nmost   accurate\
    \   and  stable  time  reference.   The  prime\nmotivation for this note is to\
    \ promote  the  development  of\nthis  service  in  other internet hosts and gateways\
    \ so that\nthe feasibility for its use thoughout the community  can  be\nassessed.\n\
    ICS Datagrams and Timestamps\n     At present, the ICS is provided using  either\
    \  ICMP  or\nGGP  datagrams.   The  only difference between these is that\nICMP\
    \ uses protocol number 1 and GGP uses protocol number  3.\n 0                \

    \                       ICS Datagram Format\n     The originator fills in all\
    \ three timestamp fields just\nbefore  the datagram is forwarded to the net. \
    \ Each of these\nfields contain the local time at origination.  Although  the\n\
    last   two   are   redundant,  they  allow  roundtrip  delay\nmeasurements  to\
    \  be  made  using   remote   hosts   without\ntimestamping  facilities.   The\
    \ \"Type\" field can be either 8\n(GGP Echo) or 13 (ICMP Timestamp).  The \"Code\"\
    \ field  should\nbe zero.  The \"Sequence\" field can contain either zero or an\n\
    optional sequence number provided by the user.   The  length\nof  the datagram\
    \ is thus 36 octets inclusive of the 20-octet\ninternet header and exclusive of\
    \ the local-network leader.\n     The host or gateway receiving an ICS datagram\
    \ fills  in\nthe  \"Receive  Timestamp\"  field  just  as  the  datagram is\n\
    received from the net and the \"Transmit Timestamp\"  just  as\nit is forwarded\
    \ back to the sender.  It also sets the \"Type\"\nfield to 0 (GGP Echo Reply),\
    \ if the original value was 8, or\n14  (ICMP  Timestamp  Reply),  if  it was 13.\
    \  The remaining\nfields are unchanged.\n     The timestamp values are in milliseconds\
    \ from  midnight\nUT and are stored right-justified in the 32-bit fields shown\n\
    above.  Ordinarily,  all  time  calculations  are  performed\nmodulo-24 hours\
    \ in milliseconds.  This provides a convenient\nmatch to those operating systems\
    \  which  maintain  a  system\nclock  in ticks past midnight.  The specified timestamp\
    \ unit\nof milliseconds is consistent with the accuracy of  existing\nradio  clocks\
    \  and  the  errors expected in the timestamping\nprocess itself.\nDelay Measurements\n\
    \     Delay measurements can be made with any DCNET  host  by\nsimply sending\
    \ an ICS datagram in the above format to it and\nprocessing the reply.  Let t1,\
    \ t2 and t3 represent the three\ntimestamp  fields  of  the reply in order and\
    \ t4 the time of\n(t2 - t1) + (t4 - t3)  for the roundtrip.  Note that, in the\n\
    case of the roundtrip, the clock offsets between the sending\nhost and DCNET host\
    \ cancel.\n     Although ICS datagrams are returned by all DCNET  hosts\nregardless\
    \  of  other connections that may be in use by that\nhost at any given time, the\
    \ most useful host  will  probably\nbe   the   COMSAT-WWV   virtual  host  at\
    \  internet  address\n[29,0,9,2], which is also the  internet  echo  virtual \
    \ host\nformerly  called  COMSAT-ECH.  This virtual host is resident\nin  the\
    \  COMSAT-GAT  physical  host  at   internet   address\n[29,0,1,2], which is connected\
    \ to the ARPANET via the COMSAT\nGateway, Clarksburg SIMP and a 4800-bps line\
    \ to  IMP  71  at\nBBN.    The  roundtrip  delay  via  this  path  between  the\n\
    COMSAT-GAT  host  and  the  BBN  Gateway  is  typically  550\nmilliseconds as\
    \ the ICS datagram flies.\n     As in the case of all DCNET hosts,  if  the  COMSAT-WWV\n\
    virtual  host  is  down  (in  this case possible only if the\nSpectracom radio\
    \ clock is down or misbehaving) a  \"host  not\nreachable\"   GGP   datagram \
    \  is   returned.    In   unusual\ncircumstances a \"net not reachable\" or \"\
    source  quench\"  GGP\ndatagram  could  be  returned.   Note that the references\
    \ to\n\"GGP\" here will be read \"ICMP\" at  some  appropriate  future\ntime.\n\
    Local Offset Corrections\n     All DCNET timestamps are  referenced  to  a  designated\n\
    virtual  host  called  COMSAT-WWV (what else?) with internet\naddress [29,0,9,2].\
    \  This host is equipped with a Spectracom\nradio  clock  which  normally provides\
    \ WWVB time and date to\nwithin a millisecond.  The clock  synchronization  mechanism\n\
    provides  offset  and  drift  corrections  for  other  hosts\nrelative to this\
    \ host; however, offsets up to an appreciable\nfraction  of  a second routinely\
    \ occur due to the difficulty\nof tracking with power-line  clocks  in  some \
    \ machines.   A\ntable  of  the  current  offsets  can  be obtained using the\n\
    following procedure.\n1.  Connect  to  COMSAT-GAT   host   at   internet   address\n\
    \    [29,0,1,2] using TELNET and local echo.\n2.  Send the command SET HOST HOST.\
    \  A table with  one  line\n    per DCNET host should be returned.  Note the entry\
    \ under\n    the \"Offset\" column for the WWV host.  This contains the\n    offset\
    \  in  milliseconds  that  should  be  added to all\n    timestamps  generated\
    \  by  either  the   COMSAT-GAT   or\n    COMSAT-WWV  hosts to yield the correct\
    \ time as broadcast\n    by WWVB.\n    time.\" The string  following  this  is\
    \  the  last  reply\n    received from the Spectracom unit in the format:\n  \
    \                <code>  DDD HH:MM:SS  TZ=00\n    where <code> is normally <SP>\
    \ in case the WWVB signal is\n    being  received  correctly  or ? in case it\
    \ is not.  The\n    DDD represents the day of the year and HH:MM:SS the time\n\
    \    past   UT   midnight.   The  two  digits  following  TZ=\n    represent the\
    \ time zone, here 00 for UT.\n4.  Close the connection (please!).\nREFERENCES\n\
