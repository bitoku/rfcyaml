  - "           Comments on IMP/HOST and HOST/IMP Protocol Changes\n   With reference\
    \ to RFC's 687, 690, and 692 (NIC's 32564, 32699, and\n   32734, respectively)\
    \ by D.C. Walden, J. Postel, and S. Wolfe\n   (respectively), I would like to\
    \ offer some observations relative to\n   current international standards recommendations\
    \ from working group\n   6.1 of the International Federation of Information Processing.\
    \  In a\n   meeting held last May at the NCC, this working group voted to present\n\
    \   a recommendation to CCITT (International Consultative Committee on\n   Telephony\
    \ and Telegraphy of the International Telegraphics Union) for\n   a standard packet\
    \ (or DATAGRAM) header.\n   The proposed packet header format is meant to interface\
    \ hosts to\n   packet networks.  It is not a header for Host-to-Host protocol,\
    \ nor\n   is it an IMP-to-IMP header.  The bulk of the header is taken up with\n\
    \   addressing space(96 bits!)  since this will be compatible with the\n   current\
    \ maximum address space of the telephone system (14 digits).\n   LOCAL NETWORK\
    \ FIELD - 4 bits\n      This field allows local networks to operate easily on\
    \ multiple\n      formats, since the 4 bits can be used in any fashion desired\
    \ by\n      the local network.\n   DATAGRAM FORMAT - 4 bits\n      This field\
    \ could be used by ARPANET to contain \"1001\" binary, so\n      as to maintain\
    \ backward compatibility with the existing message\n      leader format.\n   PACKET\
    \ TYPE CODE - 8 bits\n      This could be used for the HOST/IMP and IMP/HOST code.\n\
    \   FACILITIES - 16 bits\n      These bits have not yet been specifically allocated.\
    \  Some will no\n      doubt be for international services (e.g., tracing at gateways\n\
    \      between networks, accounting, class of service).  It was the\n      feeling\
    \ of WG 6.1 members that some of these bits (e.g., 8) might\n      be allocated\
    \ to the originating network (or destination network)\n      for its own use.\n\
    \   TEXT LENGTH - 16 bits\n      These bits count the number of octets in the\
    \ text of the packet,\n      not including octets in the header (which is fixed\
    \ in length for\n      any particular format).\n   DESTINATION ADDRESS - 48 bits\
    \ [1]\n      These bits could be allocated in the following way: Destination\n\
    \      Network Identifier - 8 bits; Destination Host Identifier - 8 bits;\n  \
    \    Destination IMP identifier - 16 bits; Reserved- 16 bits.\n   SOURCE ADDRESS\
    \ - 48 bits\n      These bits would be used in a fashion similar to the destination\n\
    \      address bits.\n   The resulting packet is 144 bits long and adding the\
    \ present 40-bit\n   Host-to-Host header results in a total of 184 bits, which\
    \ is not very\n   pleasant.  A temporary fix (until we can introduce a new NCP\
    \ design)\n   might be to squeeze out the reserved 16-bit fields in the source\
    \ and\n   destination address fields, giving 32 bits to carry the byte size and\n\
    \   byte count information for the present Host/Host protocol.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ the length field of the packet header and one of the\n   facilities flags (or\
    \ a whole field) could be used to indicate byte\n   size and byte count.  Either\
    \ idea would require some fairly\n   substantial modification of existing NCP\
    \ programs, so is probably not\n   very palatable.\n   Another alternative would\
    \ be to add a dummy byte after the 144th bit\n   of header, followed by 40 bits\
    \ of NCP header, giving a total length\n   of message leader and NCP header of\
    \ 192 bits, a number divisible by\n   12, 16, 24, 32, 48.\n   With respect to\
    \ the proposed text length field, although bit lengths\n   are the most flexible,\
    \ it seems reasonable to admit that nearly all\n   data transmission is done in\
    \ 8-bit quantities, and therefore that bit\n   lengths are, in fact, an unnecessary\
    \ luxury.  This is a weak argument\n   when 36-bit and 32-bit machines must interface.\n\
