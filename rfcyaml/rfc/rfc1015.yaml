  - "OVERVIEW\n    Networking has become widespread in the scientific community, and\n\
    \    even more so in the computer science community. There are networks\n    being\
    \ supported by a number of the Federal agencies interested in\n    scientific\
    \ research, and many scientists throughout the country have\n    access to one\
    \ or more of these networks. Furthermore, there are many\n    resources (such\
    \ as supercomputers) that are accessible via these\n    networks.\n    While many\
    \ of these networks are interconnected on an informal\n    basis, there is currently\
    \ no consistent mechanism to allow sharing\n    of the networking resources. Recognizing\
    \ this problem, the FCCSET\n    Committee on Very High Performance Computing formed\
    \ a Network\n    Working Group. This group has recommended an administrative and\n\
    \    management structure for interconnecting the current and planned\n    agency\
    \ networks supporting research.  The structure is based on the\n    concept of\
    \ a network of networks using standard networking\n    protocols.\n    This report\
    \ elaborates on the earlier recommendation and provides an\n    implementation\
    \ plan. It addresses three major areas; communications\n    infrastructure, user\
    \ support, and ongoing research. A management and\n    administrative structure\
    \ is recommended for each area, and a\n    budgetary estimate provided.  A phased\
    \ approach for implementation\n    is suggested that will quickly provide interconnection\
    \ and lead to\n    the full performance and functionality as the required technologies\n\
    \    are developed and installed.  While this report addresses the\n    interconnection\
    \ of agency networks, and cooperation by certain\n    federal agencies, some discussion\
    \ is presented of the possible role\n    that industry can play in support and\
    \ use of such a network.\n    Work reported herein was supported by Cooperative\
    \ Agreement NCC 2-\n    387 from the National Aeronautics and Space Adminstration\
    \ (NASA) to\n    the Universities Space Research Association (USRA). This report\
    \ was\n    prepared in response to a request from John Cavallini, Chairman of\n\
    \    the Networking Working Group of the FCCSET Committee on Very High\n    Performance\
    \ Computing.\n"
- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n    Computer networks are critical in providing scientists access\
    \ to\n    computing resources (such as supercomputers) and permitting computer\n\
    \    supported interaction between researchers.  Several agencies,\n    recognizing\
    \ this need, have established networks to provide the\n    needed communications\
    \ infrastructure.  The need for this\n    infrastructure, though, cuts across\
    \ the various agencies. To that\n    end, the FCCSET Committee on Very High Performance\
    \ Computing Network\n    Working Group has recommended the formation of an Interagency\n\
    \    Research Internet (IRI) [1].\n    The purpose of this report is to suggest\
    \ an implementation plan for\n    such an IRI. It addresses three major areas;\
    \ communications\n    infrastructure, user support, and ongoing research. A management\
    \ and\n    administrative structure is recommended for each area, and a\n    budgetary\
    \ estimate provided. A phased approach for implementation is\n    suggested that\
    \ will quickly provide interconnection and lead to the\n    full performance and\
    \ functionality as the required technologies are\n    developed and installed.\
    \ Finally, some discussion is presented on a\n    possible role for industry in\
    \ supporting and using such a network.\n"
- title: Motivation
  contents:
  - "Motivation\n    The prime responsibility for providing the required infrastructure\n\
    \    for successful research lies with the researcher, his/her\n    institution,\
    \ and the agency supporting that research.  Thus, the\n    individual agencies\
    \ have installed and are continuing to enhance\n    computer networks to allow\
    \ their researchers to access advanced\n    computing resources such as supercomputers\
    \ as well as being able to\n    communicate with each other via such facilities\
    \ as electronic mail.\n    However, there are a number of reasons why it is advantageous\
    \ to\n    interconnect the various agency networks in a coherent manner so as\n\
    \    to provide a common \"virtual\" network supporting research.\n    The need\
    \ to make effective use of available networks without\n    unnecessary duplication.\
    \  The agencies each support researchers in\n    many parts of the country, and\
    \ have installed equally widespread\n    resources. Often, it is more effective\
    \ for a scientist to be\n    provided networking service through a different agency\
    \ network than\n    the one funding his research. For example, suppose several\n\
    \    scientists at an institution are already being funded by NASA and\n    are\
    \ connected to a NASA supported network. Now a scientist at the\n    same institution\
    \ but supported by NSF needs access to an NSF\n    supercomputer. It is much more\
    \ effective to provide that\n    connectivity through an interconnection of NASA\
    \ and NSF networks\n    than to establish another connection (to NSFnet) to the\
    \ same\n    university.\n    The need to establish communication infrastructure\
    \ to permit\n    scientists to access resources without regard to which network\
    \ they\n    are connected but without violating access controls on either the\n\
    \    networks or the resources. A scientist may be supported by multiple\n   \
    \ agencies, and therefore have access to resources provided by several\n    agencies.\
    \ It is not cost-effective to have to provide a separate\n    network connection\
    \ to the scientist for each of those agency\n    resources.\n    The need for\
    \ a communications infrastructure to encourage\n    collaborative scientific research.\
    \ One of the primary functions of a\n    computer network supporting science is\
    \ the encouraging of\n    collaboration between researchers.  Scientific disciplines\
    \ typically\n    cut across many different agencies. Thus, support of this\n \
    \   collaboration should be without regard to agency affiliation or\n    support\
    \ of the scientists involved.\n    The need for a cooperative research and development\
    \ program to\n    evolve and enhance the IRI and its components where appropriate.\n\
    \    Scientific research is highly demanding of both the computing and\n    networking\
    \ environment. To assure that these needs continue to be\n    met, it is necessary\
    \ to continually advance the state of the art in\n    networking, and apply the\
    \ results to the research networks.  No\n    individual agency can  afford to\
    \ support the required research\n    alone, nor is it desirable to have inordinate\
    \ duplication of\n    research.\n"
- title: Summary of previous report
  contents:
  - "Summary of previous report\n    These reasons led to the formation of the FCCSET\
    \ Commitee on Very\n    High Performance Computing and its Network Working Group.\
    \ This group\n    began in early 1985 to discuss the possibility of interconnecting\n\
    \    into a common networking facility the various agency networks\n    supporting\
    \ scientific research. These discussions led to the report\n    issued earlier\
    \ this year [1] recommending such an approach.\n    The report used the \"Network\
    \ of Networks\" or Internet model of\n    interconnection.  Using a standard set\
    \ of protocols, the various\n    networks can be connected to provide a common\
    \ set of user services\n    across heterogenous networks and heterogenous host\
    \ computers [2,\n    3,4]. This approach is discussed further in the Background\
    \ section\n    below.\n    The report goes on to recommend an administrative and\
    \ management\n    structure that matches the technical approach.  Each agency\
    \ would\n    continue to manage and administer its individual networks. An\n \
    \   interagency body would provide direction to a selected organization\n    who\
    \ would provide the management and operation of the\n    interconnections of the\
    \ networks and the common user services\n    provided over the network. This selected\
    \ organization would also\n    provide for coordination of research activities,\
    \ needed\n    developments, and reflecting research community requirements into\n\
    \    the national and  international standards activities.\n"
- title: Overview of Implementation Plan
  contents:
  - "Overview of Implementation Plan\n    The general structure of the proposed IRI\
    \ is analogous to a federal\n    approach. Each of the agencies is responsible\
    \ for operating its own\n    networks and satisfying its users' requirements.\
    \ The IRI provides\n    the interconnecting infrastructure to permit the users\
    \ on one\n    network to access resources or users on other networks. The IRI\
    \ also\n    provides a set of standards and services which the individual\n  \
    \  agencies, networks, and user communities can exploit in providing\n    capabilities\
    \ to their individual users.  The management structure,\n    likewise, provides\
    \ a  mechanism by which the individual agencies can\n    cooperate without interfering\
    \ with the agencies' individual\n    authorities or responsibilities.\n    In\
    \ this report, an implementation plan for the IRI is proposed.\n    First, some\
    \ background is given of the previous efforts to provide\n    networks in support\
    \ of research, and the genesis of those networks.\n    A description of the suggested\
    \ approach to attaining an IRI is then\n    given. This description is divided\
    \ into two sections; technical and\n    management. The technical approach consists\
    \ of two components. First\n    is the provision of an underlying communications\
    \ infrastructure;\n    i.e. a means for providing connectivity between the various\n\
    \    computers and workstations.  Second is provision of the means for\n    users\
    \ to make effective use of that infrastructure in support of\n    their research.\n\
    \    The management section elaborates on the suggestions made in the\n    FCCSET\
    \ committee report.  A structure is suggested that allows the\n    various agencies\
    \ to cooperate in the operations, maintenance,\n    engineering, and research\
    \ activities required for the IRI.  This\n    structure also provides the necessary\
    \ mechanisms for the scientific\n    research community to provide input with\
    \ respect to requirements and\n    approaches.\n    Finally, a phased implementation\
    \ plan is presented which would allow\n    the IRI to be put in place rapidly\
    \ with modest funding.  A budgetary\n    estimate is also provided.\n"

  - "BACKGROUND\n    The combination of packet switched computer networks,\n    internetworking\
    \ to allow heterogeneous computers to communicate over\n    heterogeneous networks,\
    \ the widespread use of local area networks,\n    and the availability of workstations\
    \ and supercomputers has given\n    rise to the opportunity to provide greatly\
    \ improved computing\n    capabilities to science and engineering. This is the\
    \ major\n    motivation behind the IRI.\n"
- title: History of Research Network
  contents:
  - "History of Research Network\n    The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\
    \ (DARPA) developed the\n    concept of packet switching beginning in the mid\
    \ 1960's.  Beginning\n    with the Arpanet (the world's first packet switched\
    \ network) [5],a\n    number of networks have been developed. These have included\
    \ packet\n    satellite networks [6,7], packet radio networks [8,7], and local\n\
    \    area networks [9].\n    Although the original motivation for the Arpanet\
    \ development was\n    computer resource sharing, it was apparent early on that\
    \ a major use\n    of such networks would be for access to computer resources\
    \ and\n    interaction between users [10].  Following the Arpanet development,\n\
    \    a number of other networks have been developed and used to provide\n    both\
    \ of these functions [11]. CSNET was initiated to provide\n    communications\
    \ between computer science researchers [12,13].  CSNET\n    was initiated by the\
    \ NSF in cooperation with a number of\n    universities, but is now self-sufficient.\
    \   Its subscribers include\n    universities throughout the world as well as\
    \ industrial members\n    interested in interacting with computer scientists.\n\
    \    CSNET makes use of a number of networking technologies including the\n  \
    \  Arpanet, public X.25 networks, and dial-up connections over phone\n    lines,\
    \ to support electronic mail and other networking functions. In\n    addition\
    \ to the basic data transport service, CSNET and Arpanet\n    operate network\
    \ information centers which provide help to users of\n    the network as well\
    \ as a number of services including a listing of\n    users with their mail addresses\
    \ (white pages) and a repository where\n    relevant documents are stored and\
    \ can be retrieved.\n    With the installation of supercomputers came the desire\
    \ to provide\n    network access for researchers.  One of the early networks to\n\
    \    provide this capability was MFEnet [11].  It was established in the\n   \
    \ early 1970's to provide DOE-supported users access to\n    supercomputers, particularly\
    \ a Cray 1 at Lawrence Livermore National\n    Labs. Because MFEnet was established\
    \ prior to widespread adoption of\n    the TCP/IP protocol suite (to be discussed\
    \ below), the MFEnet uses a\n    different set of protocols. However, interfaces\
    \ have been developed\n    between the MFEnet and other networks, and a migration\
    \ plan is\n    currently under development.\n    NASA Ames Research Center has\
    \ long been in the forefront of using\n    advanced computers to support scientific\
    \ research.  The latest\n    computing facility, the Numerical Aerodynamic Simulator,\
    \ uses a Cray\n    2 and other machines along  with a number of networking technologies\n\
    \    to provide support to computational fluid dynamics researchers [14].\n  \
    \  This system uses the TCP/IP protocol suite both locally and remotely\n    and\
    \ provides easy access through advanced workstations.\n    Recognizing the importance\
    \ of advanced computers in carrying out\n    scientific research, NSF in 1984\
    \ embarked on an ambitious program to\n    provide supercomputer access to researchers.\
    \ This program involved\n    both the provision of supercomputers themselves (through\
    \ purchase of\n    computer time initially, and establishment of supercomputer\
    \ centers)\n    and provision of access to those supercomputers through an extensive\n\
    \    networking program, NSFnet [15]. The NSFnet uses a number of\n    existing\
    \ networks (e.g. Arpanet, BITNET, MFEnet) and exploratory\n    networks interconnected\
    \ using the TCP/IP protocol suite (discussed\n    below) to permit scientists\
    \ widespread access to the supercomputer\n    centers and each other. The NSFnet\
    \ is also taking advantage of the\n    widespread installation of campus and regional\
    \ networks to achieve\n    this connectivity in a cost effective manner.\n   \
    \ The above are only a small number of the current and existing\n    networks\
    \ being used to support research.  Quarterman [11] provides a\n    good synopsis\
    \ of the networks currently in operation. It is obvious\n    from this that effective\
    \ interconnection of the networks can provide\n    cost-efficient and reliable\
    \ services.\n    Starting in the early 1970's, recognizing that the military had\
    \ a\n    need to interconnect various networks (such as packet radio for\n   \
    \ mobile operation with long-line networks like the Arpanet), DARPA\n    initiated\
    \ the development of the internet technologies [16].\n    Beginning with the development\
    \ of the protocols for interconnection\n    and reliable transport (TCP/IP), the\
    \ program  has developed methods\n    for providing electronic mail, remote login,\
    \ file transfer and\n    similar functions between differing computers over dissimilar\n\
    \    networks [4,3].  Today, using that technology, thousands of\n    computers\
    \ are able to communicate with each other over a \"virtual\n    network\" of approximately\
    \ 200 networks using a common set of\n    protocols. The concepts developed are\
    \ being used in the reference\n    model and protocols of the Open Systems Interconnection\
    \ model being\n    developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO)\
    \ [17].\n    This is becoming even more important with the widespread use of\n\
    \    local area networks.  As institutions install their own networks,\n    and\
    \ need to establish communications with computers at other sites,\n    it is important\
    \ to have a common set of protocols and a means for\n    interconnecting the local\
    \ networks to wide area networks.\n"
- title: Internet Model
  contents:
  - "Internet Model\n    The DARPA Internet system uses a naming and addressing protocol,\n\
    \    called the Internet Protocol (IP), to interconnect networks into a\n    single\
    \ virtual network. Figure 1 shows the interconnection of a\n    variety of networks\
    \ into the Internet system.  The naming and\n    addressing structure allows any\
    \ computer on any network to address\n    in a uniform manner any computer on\
    \ any other network. Special\n    processors, called Gateways, are installed at\
    \ the interfaces between\n    two or more networks and provide both routing amongst\
    \ the various\n    networks as well as the appropriate translation from internet\n\
    \    addresses to the address required for the attached networks. Thus,\n    packets\
    \ of data can flow between computers on the internet.\n    Because of the possiblity\
    \ of packet loss or errors, the Transmission\n    Control Protocol (TCP) is used\
    \ above the IP to provide for\n    reliability and sequencing. TCP together with\
    \ IP and the various\n    networks and gateways then provides for reliable and\
    \ ordered\n    delivery of data between computers. A  variety of functions can\
    \ use\n    this connection to provide service to the users. A summary of the\n\
    \    functions provided by the current internet system is given in [4].\n    To\
    \ assure interoperability between military users of the system, the\n    Office\
    \ of the Secretary of Defense mandated the use of the TCP/IP\n    protocol suite\
    \ wherever there is a need for interoperable packet\n    switched communications.\
    \ This led to the standardization of the\n    protocols [18, 19, 20, 21, 22].\n\

    \ suite and associated mechanisms (e.g.\n    gateways) provides a way to interconnect\
    \ heterogeneous computers on\n    heterogenous networks. Routing and addressing\

    \ ISO is\n    currently developing a set of standards for interconnection which\n\
    \    are very similar in function to the DARPA developed technologies.\n    Although\
    \ ISO is making great strides, and the  National Bureau of\n    Standards is working\
    \ with a set of manufacturers to develop and\n    demonstrate these standards,\
    \  the TCP/IP protocol suite still\n    represents the most available and tested\
    \ technology for\n    interconnection of computers and networks. It is for that\
    \ reason\n    that several agencies/programs, including the Department of Defense,\n\
    \    NSF and NASA/NAS, have all adopted the TCP/IP suite as the most\n    viable\
    \ set of standards currently. As the international standards\n    mature, and\
    \ products supporting them appear, it can be expected that\n    the various networks\
    \ will switch to using those standards.\n"
- title: TECHNICAL APPROACH
  contents:
  - "TECHNICAL APPROACH\n    The Internet technology described above provides the\
    \ basis for\n    interconnection of the various agency networks. The means to\n\
    \    interconnect must satisfy a number of constraints if it is to be\n    viable\
    \ in a multi-agency environment.\n    Each agency must retain control of its own\
    \ networks. Networks have\n    been established to support agency-specific missions\
    \ as well as\n    general computer communications within the agency and its\n\
    \    contractors. To assure that these missions continue to be supported\n   \
    \ appropriately, as well as assure appropriate accountability for the\n    network\
    \ operation, the mechanism for interconnection must not\n    prevent the agencies\
    \ from retaining control over their individual\n    networks.\n    This is not\
    \ to say that agencies may not choose to have their\n    individual networks operated\
    \ by the IRI, or even turned over to the\n    IRI if they determine that to be\
    \ appropriate.\n    Appropriate access control, privacy, and accounting mechanisms\
    \ must\n    be incorporated. This includes access control to data, resources,\n\
    \    and the networks themselves, privacy of user data, and accounting\n    mechanisms\
    \ to support both cost allocation and cost auditing [23].\n    The technical and\
    \ adminstrative approach must allow (indeed\n    encourage) the incorporation\
    \ of evolving technologies. In\n    particular, the network must evolve towards\
    \ provision of high\n    bandwidth, type of service routing, and other advanced\
    \ techniques to\n    allow effective use of new computing technology in a distributed\n\
    \    research environment.\n"
- title: Communications Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "Communications Infrastructure\n    The communications infrastructure provides\
    \ connectivity between user\n    machines, workstations, and centralized resources\
    \ such as\n    supercomputers and database machines. This roughly corresponds\
    \ to\n    communications services at and below the transport layer in the ISO\n\
    \    OSI reference model.  There are two different types of networks. The\n  \
    \  first are local networks, meaning those which are internal to a\n    facility,\
    \ campus, etc. The second are networks which provide transit\n    service between\
    \ facilities. These transit networks can connect\n    directly to computers, but\
    \ are evolving in a direction of connecting\n    local networks. The networks\
    \ supported by the individual agencies\n    directly are mainly in the category\
    \ of transit (or long-haul)\n    networks, as they typically provide nationwide\
    \ connectivity, and\n    usually leave communications within a facility to be\
    \ dealt with by\n    the facility itself. The IRI communications infrastructure\
    \ thus\n    deals mainly with the interconnection of transit networks.\n    The\
    \ internet model described above provides a simple method for\n    interconnecting\
    \ transit networks (as well as local networks.)  By\n    using IP gateways between\
    \ the agency networks, packet transport\n    service can be provided between computers\
    \ on any of the various\n    networks. The placement of the gateways and their\
    \ capacity will have\n    to be determined by an initial engineering study. In\
    \ addition, as\n    the IRI evolves, it may be cost-effective to install one or\
    \ more\n    wide area networks (or designate certain existing ones) to be IRI\n\
    \    transit networks, to be used by all agencies on a cost  sharing\n    basis.\
    \ Thus, the IRI communications infrastructure would consist of\n    the interconnecting\
    \ gateways plus any networks used specifically as\n    transit networks. Using\
    \ IP as the standard for interconnection of\n    networks and global addressing\
    \ provides a common virtual network\n    packet transport service, upon which\
    \ can be built various other\n    network services such as file transfer and electronic\
    \ mail.  This\n    will allow sharing of the communication facilities (channels,\n\
    \    satellites, etc.) between the various user/agency communities in a\n    cost\
    \ effective manner.\n    To assure widespread interconnectivity, it is important\
    \ that\n    standards be adopted for use in the IRI and the various computers\n\
    \    connected to it. These standards need to cover not only the packet\n    transport\
    \ capability but must address all the services required for\n    networking in\
    \ a scientific domain, including but not limited to file\n    transfer, remote\
    \ login, and electronic  mail.  Ultimately it is\n    desirable to move towards\
    \ a single set of standards for the various\n    common services, and the logical\
    \ choice for those standards are\n    those being developed in the international\
    \ commercial community\n    (i.e. the ISO standards).  However, many of the scientific\
    \ networks\n    today use one or more of a small number of different standards;\
    \ in\n    particular the TCP/IP protocol suite mentioned above, the MFEnet\n \
    \   protocols, and DECNET. As the international standards mature, it is\n    expected\
    \ that the number of communities using the same protocol\n    suite will grow\
    \ [5] [6].  Even today, several of the\n    agencies/communities are using a common\
    \ protocol suite, namely the\n    TCP/IP suite. All the users connected to those\
    \ computers and\n    networks are able to have the full functions of an interoperable\n\
    \    networking capability. And therefore the ability of the users to\n    share\
    \ resources and results will increase.\n"
- title: User Services
  contents:
  - "User Services\n    In order that scientists can effectively use the network,\
    \ there\n    needs to be a user support organization.  To maximize the cost\n\
    \    effectiveness of the overall IRI, the local user support personnel\n    must\
    \ be used effectively.  In particular, it is anticipated that\n    direct support\
    \ of users/researchers would be provided by local\n    support personnel. The\
    \ IRI user support organization would provide\n    support to those local support\
    \ personnel in areas where nationwide\n    common service is cost effective.\n\
    \    In particular, the this organization has several functions:  assist\n   \
    \ the local support personnel in the installation of facilities\n    compatible\
    \ with the IRI, provide references to standard facilities\n    (e.g. networking\
    \ interfaces, mail software) to the local support\n    personnel, answer questions\
    \ that local personnel are not able to\n    answer, aid in the provision of specific\
    \ user community services,\n    e.g.  database of relevance to specific scientific\
    \ domain.\n"
- title: Internet Research Coordination
  contents:
  - "Internet Research Coordination\n    To evolve internet to satisfy new scientific\
    \ requirements and make\n    use of new technology, research is required in several\
    \ areas.  These\n    include high speed networking, type of service routing, new\
    \ end to\n    end protocols,  and congestion control.  The IRI organizational\n\
    \    structure can assist in identifying areas of research where the\n    various\
    \ agencies have a common interest in supporting in order to\n    evolve the network,\
    \ and then assist in the coordination of that\n    research.\n"
- title: MANAGEMENT APPROACH
  contents:
  - "MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n    A management approach is required that will allow each\
    \ agency to\n    retain control of its own networking assets while sharing certain\n\
    \    resources with users sponsored by other agencies.  To accomplish\n    this,\
    \ the following principles and constraints need to be followed.\n    IRI consists\
    \ of the infrastructure to connect agency networks and\n    the user services\
    \ required for effective use of the combined\n    networks and resources.\n  \
    \  An organization must be identified to be responsible for the\n    engineering,\
    \ operation, and maintenance of both the interconnecting\n    infrastructure and\
    \ the user services support.\n    While some agencies may choose to make use of\
    \ IRI facilities and\n    contractors to manage their individual agency networks,\
    \ this would\n    not be required and is not anticipated to be the normal situation.\n\
    \    Any such arrangement would have  to be negotiated individually and\n    directly\
    \ between the agency and the IRI operations organization.\n    Normally, the IRI\
    \ organization would neither manage the individual\n    agency networks nor have\
    \ any jurisdiction within such networks.\n    Gateways that interconnect the agency\
    \ networks as well as any long-\n    haul networks put in place specifically as\
    \ jointly supported transit\n    networks (if any such networks are required)\
    \ will be managed and\n    operated under the IRI organization.\n    A support\
    \ organization for common IRI services is required.  The\n    principal clients\
    \ for these services would be the local support\n    personnel.\n    The IRI structure\
    \ should support the coordination of the individual\n    research activities required\
    \ for evolution and enhancement of the\n    IRI.\n"
- title: General Management Structure
  contents:
  - "General Management Structure\n    Figure 2 shows the basic management structure\
    \ for the IRI.  It is\n    based on the use of a non-profit organization (call\
    \ it the\n    Interagency Research Internet Organization, IRIO) to manage both\
    \ the\n    communications infrastructure and user support. The IRIO contracts\n\
    \    for the engineering, development, operations, and maintenance of\n    those\
    \ services with various commercial and other organizations. It\n    would be responsible\
    \ for providing technical and administrative\n    management of the contractors\
    \ providing these functions. Having the\n    IRI operational management provided\
    \ by an independent non-profit\n    organization skilled in the area of computer\
    \ networking will permit\n    the flexibility required to deal with the evolving\
    \ and changing\n    demands of scientific networking in a cost-effective manner.\n\
    \    Direction and guidance for the IRIO will be provided by a Policy\n    Board\
    \ consisting of representatives from the Government agencies who\n    are funding\
    \ the IRI. The Chairman of the Board will be selected from\n    the agency representatives\
    \ on a rotating basis. The Board will also\n    have an Executive Director to\
    \ provide administrative and other\n    support. To provide effective support\
    \ for the IRI Policy Board as\n    well as assure appropriate coordination with\
    \ the IRIO, the Executive\n    Director shall be the Director of the IRIO.\n \
    \   To assure that the IRI provides the best support possible to the\n    scientific\
    \ research community, the Policy Board will be advised by a\n    Technical Advisory\
    \ Board (TAB) consisting of representatives from\n    the network research and\
    \ engineering community, the various networks\n    being interconnected with the\
    \ IRI, and the scientific user\n    community.  Members of the TAB will be selected\
    \ by the Policy Board.\n    The TAB will review the operational support of science\
    \ being\n    provided by the IRI and suggest directions for improvement. The TAB\n\
    \    will interface directly with the IRIO to review the operational\n    status\
    \ and plans for the future, and recommend to the Policy Board\n    any changes\
    \ in priorities or directions.\n    Research activities related to the use and\
    \ evolution of the internet\n    system will be coordinated by the Internet Research\
    \ Activities Board\n    (IRAB). The IRAB consists of the chairmen of the research\
    \ task\n    forces (see below) and has as ex-officio members technical r\n   \
    \ representatives from the funding agencies  and the IRIO.  The\n    charter of\
    \ the IRAB is to identify required directions for research\n    to improve the\
    \ IRI, and recommend such directions to the funding\n    agencies. In addition,\
    \ the IRAB will continually review ongoing\n    research activities and identify\
    \ how they can be exploited to\n    improve the IRI.\n    The Research Task Forces\
    \ will each be concerned with a particular\n    area/emphasis of research (e.g.\
    \ end-to-end protocols, gateway\n    architectures, etc.). Members will be active\
    \ researchers in the\n    field and the chairman an expert in the area with a\
    \ broad\n    understanding of research both in that area and the general internet\n\
    \    (and its use for scientific research). The chairmen of the task\n    forces\
    \ will be selected by IRAB, and thus the IRAB will be a self-\n    elected and\
    \ governing organization representing the networking\n    research community.\
    \ The chairmen will solicit the members of the\n    task force as volunteers.\n"

- title: Funding
  contents:
  - "Funding\n    In this section, the funding of the IRI is described. Recall that\n\
    \    the IRI consists of the infrastructure to connect the agency\n    networks\
    \ and the services required for users to make effective use\n    of such an infrastructure.\
    \ These costs are divided into two\n    categories; operations costs and research\
    \ costs. The operations\n    costs are those to operate and maintain both the\
    \ communications\n    infrastructure and the user services.  These costs must\
    \ be shared\n    between the various agencies and channeled to the IRIO to operate\n\
    \    the IRI. The research costs are those used to carry out the needed\n    research\
    \ to evolve the IRI. These costs are handled within the\n    various agency budgets\
    \ and used to support research in each agency\n    with coordination between the\
    \ agencies.\n"
- title: Operations Cost
  contents:
  - "Operations Cost\n    Each participating agency will contribute a share of operations\
    \ cost\n    of IRI. Initially, each agency will contribute an equal share.\n \
    \   Later, perhaps, the agency contributions will be adjusted according\n    to\
    \ a number of factors such as number of users, amount of traffic,\n    type of\
    \ support required (high bandwidth real time versus low\n    bandwidth mail for\
    \ example).\n    To facilitate the funding and administration of the IRI, one\
    \ agency\n    will be selected to manage the contract with IRIO. All funds will\n\
    \    flow through that agency to the IRIO via interagency transfer. The\n    role\
    \ of the selected agency would be to provide the needed\n    contractual activities\
    \ and adminstrative management. Technical\n    guidance and monitoring of IRIO\
    \ activities would be provided by the\n    IRI Policy Board.\n    It is not yet\
    \ clear which Federal agency is best for this role.  The\n    requirements for\
    \ such an agency include the ability to deal flexibly\n    with the evolving requirements\
    \ of the IRI, to deal with funding\n    flowing from the various agencies, and\
    \ to deal flexibly with the\n    various agency technical representatives and\
    \ incorporate their\n    recommendations into the contract as required. One of\
    \ the first\n    activities required for the Policy Board would be to select an\n\
    \    appropriate funding agency.\n    All operations and maintenance funding for\
    \ the IRI will flow through\n    the IRIO to selected contractors. This allows\
    \ centralized management\n    of the operation of the IRI.\n    There are two\
    \ major assumptions underlying the budgetary estimates\n    to follow.  First\
    \ of all, the IRIO should maintain a fairly low\n    profile with respect to the\
    \ end users (i.e. the scientists and\n    researchers). That is, the users will\
    \ interact directly with their\n    local support personnel.  The IRIO will act\
    \ as facilitator and\n    coordinator, and provide facilities, information and\
    \ help services\n    to the local sites. This will allow the IRIO to remain relatively\n\
    \    small, as it will not need to deal directly with the thousands of\n    scientists/users.\n\
    \    Second, it is assumed that the operations budget supports the\n    interconnection\
    \ of agency networks as well as transit networking\n    where required, but does\
    \ not include costs of the individual agency\n    networks.\n    Appendix A provides\
    \ details of the budgetary estimate. Table 1 gives\n    a summary. Note that the\
    \ initial year has a higher expenditure of\n    capital equipment, reflecting\
    \ the need to purchase both the gateways\n    needed for initial interconnection\
    \ and the needed facilities to\n    provide the operation of the gateways and\
    \ the user services.\n    Operations costs are expected to grow by inflation while\
    \ the capital\n    costs should remain constant (decrease when inflation is considered)\n\
    \    as the IRI is stabilized.\n"
- title: Research Costs
  contents:
  - "Research Costs\n    In addition to the costs of operating and maintaining the\n\
    \    communications infrastructure and user services, funding must be\n    allocated\
    \ to support an ongoing program of research to improve and\n    evolve the IRI.\n\
    \    While each agency funds its own research program, the intent is that\n  \
    \  the various programs are coordinated through the IRI Policy Board.\n    Likewise,\
    \  while it is not intended that funds shall be combined or\n    joint funding\
    \ of projects is required, such joint activity can be\n    done on an individual\
    \ arrangement basis.\n    Each agency agrees, as part of the joint IRI activity,\
    \ to fund an\n    appropriate level of networking research in areas applicable\

  - "PHASED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n    The long-term goal of the IRI activity is to\
    \ put in place a\n    functional high-performance network available to scientists\
    \ across\n    the nation. To accomplish this goal, a steady evolution of\n   \
    \ capability is envisioned.  This phased approach involves both\n    technical\
    \ and administrative aspects.\n"
- title: Technical Phasing
  contents:
  - "Technical Phasing\n    Currently, networks are being supported by a number of\
    \ agencies as\n    discussed in Section 2. Many are using the DoD protocol suite\n\
    \    (TCP/IP, etc.) and others have incorporated or are incorporating\n    mechanisms\
    \ for interoperability with networks using the DoD protocol\n    suite (e.g. MFEnet).\
    \ Most have discussed eventual evolution to ISO\n    protocols and beyond. By\
    \ and large, most of these networks are\n    hooked together in some mainly ad\
    \ hoc manner already, some by\n    pairwise arrangement and some through third\
    \ party connections (e.g.\n    a university network connected to two agency networks).\n\
    \    There are two major shortcomings to this ad hoc connection, though.\n   \
    \ Performance is not adequate for advanced scientific environments,\n    such\
    \ as supercomputer usage, and community wide user support is not\n    generally\
    \ available. The phased apprach described below will allow\n    these deficiencies\
    \ to be overcome through coordinated action on the\n    part of the  various funding\
    \ agencies.\n"
- title: Phase I - Functional Interoperability
  contents:
  - "Phase I - Functional Interoperability\n    The initial stage of the IRI would\
    \ provide for sharing of the\n    communications facilities (e.g. channels, satellites,\
    \ etc.) by\n    interconnecting the networks using the Internet Protocol and IP\n\
    \    gateways. In addition, mechanisms will be installed (where required)\n  \
    \  and maintained to allow interconnection of the common user services,\n    such\
    \ as electronic mail. This will allow sharing of resources\n    attached to the\
    \ network, such as supercomputers. [7] [8] Note:\n    actual use of facilities\
    \ other than mail would require arrangements\n    with the various responsible\
    \ parties for each host. For example, to\n    login to a host not only requires\
    \ network access; it also requires a\n    login account on that host.\n    Specific\
    \ steps to be undertaken in Phase I are the following:\n    Gateways will be purchased\
    \ and installed where needed to\n    interconnect the agency networks. The location\
    \ and performance of\n    these gateways will be specified by the IRIO and approved\
    \ by the\n    Policy Board. This engineering will take into account an estimate\
    \ of\n    current and future traffic requirements as well as existing\n    interconnecting\
    \ gateways. It may also result in a recommendation\n    that some or all existing\
    \ gateways between agency networks be\n    replaced with common hardware so that\
    \ adequate management of the\n    interconnection can be achieved.\n    An IRI\
    \ operations and management center will be established for the\n    interconnecting\
    \ gateways. [9] [10] This perhaps could be done in\n    conjunction with a network\
    \ management center for another set of\n    gateways, e.g. those supported by\
    \ DARPA or NSF.\n    The requirement for application gateways or other techniques\
    \ to\n    interconnect communities using different protocols will be\n    investigated\
    \ and a recommendation made by the IRIO in conjuction\n    with the IRAB. The\
    \ appropriate mechanisms will be installed by the\n    IRIO at the direction of\
    \ the Policy Board.\n    An initial user services facility will be established.\
    \ This facility\n    will provide at a minimum such services as a white pages\
    \ of users\n    (similar to the current Internet \"whois\" service) and a means\
    \ for\n    making accessible standard networking software.\n    The IRAB, in coordination\
    \ with the Policy Board,  will draft a\n    coordinated research plan for the\
    \ development of the new\n    technologies required for evolution of the IRI.\n"

    \ with appropriate new capabilities and\n    functions will be installed, replacing\
    \ and/or augmenting the\n    gateways in place from Phase I.  The functionality\
    \ and performance\n    of these gateways will be specified based on the experience\
    \ from\n    Phase I use, the anticipated new uses of the network, and the state\n\
    \    of the art technologies available as a result of the ongoing\n    research.\n\
    \    The basic user services facility will be mature and support network\n   \
    \ operation. New capabilities will be developed to support specific\n    scientific\
    \ communities (such as a data base of software used by a\n    specific community\
    \ and its availability over the network.)\n    A high performance backbone network\
    \ wil be installed if needed to\n    connect high performance agency networks.\
    \ [11] [12] This is\n    anticipated because of the move in several agencies to\

- title: Administrative Phasing

  - "Administrative Phasing\n    The goal of the IRI is to get to a fully cooperating\
    \ and managed\n    interagency research internet involving most if not all of\
    \ the\n    agencies supporting scientific research. Recognizing that currently,\n\
    \    the major research networking players (both networking for research\n   \
    \ and research in networking) are DOE, NASA, DARPA, and NSF, the\n    following\
    \ steps are recommended:\n    The first and critical step is to establish a four\
    \ agency Memorandum\n    of Agreement (MOA) to interconnect the agency networks\
    \ and to share\n    the costs of interconnection, transit networks, and an operations\n\
    \    center. A management structure should be agreed upon as outlined\n    above.\
    \  Agreement must also be reached on the need to fund an\n    ongoing research\
    \ and engineering activity to evolve the internet.\n    A Policy Board and Technical\
    \ Advisory Board should be established as\n    quickly as possible to assure appropriate\
    \ guidance and direction.\n    The Policy Board shall then select an agency to\
    \ handle the\n    administrative and contractual actions with the IRIO.\n    A\
    \ non-profit organization shall then be selected by that agency\n    through an\
    \ appropriate procurement mechanism to be the IRIO. The\n    Policy Board of the\
    \ IRI shall be the selection panel.\n    The initial four agencies shall transfer\
    \ the agreed upon funds to\n    the selected contracting agency on equal basis\
    \ to start.\n    These funds will then allow the contracting agency to establish\
    \ a\n    contract for the IRIO with the selected non-profit organization.\n  \
    \  The IRIO can then establish sub-contracts for engineering,\n    procurement,\
    \ installation, and management of gateways and operation\n    of the user services\
    \ center.\n    To initiate the research coordination, the following steps will\
    \ be\n    accomplished.\n    The Internet Activities Board will evolve into the\
    \ Internet Research\n    Activities Board, through added membership and charter\
    \ revision.\n    Additional task forces will be formed as needed to reflect the\n\
    \    expanded areas of research interest.\n    Once the IRI is established and\
    \ operating, the funding and use of\n    the IRI will be reviewed to determine\
    \ if equal funding is equitable.\n    If not, the IRIO should be tasked to develop\
    \ a recommendation for a\n    practical cost allocation scheme. In addition, once\

- title: INDUSTRY ROLE
  contents:
  - "INDUSTRY ROLE\n    This report has thus far addressed the interconnection of\
    \ agency\n    supported networks and the use of such an internet by agency\n \
    \   supported researchers. However, industry also has a need for a\n    similar\
    \ infrastructure to support its research activities. [13]\n    [14]. Note that\
    \ this refers only to industrial research activities.\n    It is not envisioned,\
    \ nor would it be appropriate, for the IRI to\n    provide a communications system\
    \ for normal industrial activities.\n    Regulatory concerns make it difficult\
    \ for industry to connect to a\n    network that is supported by a federal agency\
    \ in pursuit of the\n    agency mission.\n    The IRI structure above, though,\
    \ may permit the connection of\n    industrial research organizations.  Since\
    \ the IRIO is a non-profit\n    non-government organization, it would be able\
    \ to accept funds from\n    industry as a fair share of the costs of using the\
    \ IRI. These funds\n    in turn can be used to expand the networking resources\
    \ so that no\n    degradation of service is felt by the users suppported by the\n\
    \    federal agencies. This topic would need to be discussed further by\n    the\
    \ Policy Board and the organization selected as the IRIO.\n"

    \ of\n    such research represents an exciting opportunity.  This report\n   \
    \ recommends an approach and a specific set of actions that can\n    achieve that\

- title: APPENDIX A - FUNDING BREAKDOWN
  contents:
  - "APPENDIX A - FUNDING BREAKDOWN\n    This appendix provides the details for the\
    \ budgetary estimates of\n    Table 1.\n    Gateways\n    Gateways will be required\
    \ between the various agency (and perhaps\n    regional) networks. As an upper\
    \ bound, assume one IRI gateway per\n    state times $40K per gateway, spread\
    \ out over two years, for a\n    capital cost of $1M per year for first two years.\n\
    \    Operation Center\n    The IRI operations center will have to engineer the\
    \ location and\n    capacity of the gateways, as well as install, operate and\
    \ maintain\n    them. It also will need to coordinate support and maintenance\
    \ of\n    end-to-end service, helping to identify and correct problems in the\n\
    \    interconnections. Costs are estimated as two people round the clock\n   \
    \ to man the operations center and three full time people to\n    coordinate,\
    \ operate, and engineer the IRI.  Using an estimate of\n    $120K (including other\
    \ direct costs (ODC)) per year for an operator\n    and $200K per year for other\
    \ activities, and translating 2 people\n    round the clock into 9 people results\
    \ in a total annual cost of\n    $1.7M. In addition, equipment costs of roughly\
    \ $500K per year can be\n    expected.\n    Transit Networks\n    It is expected\
    \ that support of at least one transit network will be\n    necessary. This may\
    \ involve reimbursement to one of the agencies for\n    use of their network,\
    \ or may involve operations and maintenance of\n    an IRI dedicated network.\
    \ An estimate for these costs, based on\n    historical data for operating the\
    \ Arpanet, is $4M per year.\n    User Support Organization\n    To provide effective\
    \ support as discussed above will require a staff\n    available during working\
    \ hours.  A reasonable estimate for the costs\n    of such an organization is\
    \ 5 people times $200K per year, or $1M per\n    year (including ODC). In addition,\
    \ there will be capital equipment\n    costs in the first two years totalling\
    \ roughly $2M.\n"
