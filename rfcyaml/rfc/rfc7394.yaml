  - "Abstract\n   LSP-Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and\n   Maintenance
    (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks.  However, in the\n   present form, this mechanism
    is inadequate to verify connectivity of\n   a segment of a Multi-Segment Pseudowire

    node on the path of the\n   MS-PW and/or bidirectional co-routed LSP.  This document

  - "1.  Introduction\n   An MS-PW may span across multiple service provider networks.
    \ In\n   order to allow Service Providers (SPs) to verify segments of such\n   MS-PWs
    from any node on the path of the MS-PW, any node along the\n   path of the MS-PW,
    should be able to originate an MPLS Echo Request\n   packet to any other node
    along the path of the MS-PW and receive the\n   corresponding MPLS Echo Reply.
    \ If the originator of the MPLS Echo\n   Request is at the end of a MS-PW, the
    receiver of the request can\n   send the reply back to the sender without knowing
    the hop-count\n   distance of the originator.  The reply will be intercepted by
    the\n   originator regardless of the TTL value on the reply packet.  But, if\n
    \  the originator is not at the end of the MS-PW, the receiver of the\n   MPLS
    Echo Request may need to know how many hops away the originator\n   of the MPLS
    Echo Request is so that it can set the TTL value on the\n   MPLS header for the
    MPLS Echo Reply to be intercepted at the\n   originator node.\n   In MPLS networks,
    for bidirectional co-routed LSPs, if it is desired\n   to verify connectivity
    from any intermediate node Label Switching\n   Router (LSR) on the LSP to the
    any other LSR on the LSP the receiver\n   may need to know the TTL to send the
    MPLS Echo Reply with, so as the\n   packet is intercepted by the originator node.\n
    \  A new optional TTL TLV is defined in this document.  This TLV will be\n   added
    by the originator of the MPLS Echo Request to inform the\n   receiver how many
    hops away the originator is on the path of the\n   MS-PW or bidirectional LSP.\n
    \  This mechanism only works if the MPLS Echo Reply is sent down the\n   co-routed
    LSP; hence, the scope of this TTL TLV is currently limited\n   to MS-PW or bidirectional
    co-routed MPLS LSPs.  The presence of the\n   TLV implies the use of the return
    path of the co-routed LSP, if the\n   return path is any other mechanism, then
    the TLV in the MPLS Echo\n   Request MUST be ignored.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Usage\n   The TTL TLV MAY be included in the MPLS Echo Request by the\n
      \  originator of the request.\n   If the TTL TLV is present and the receiver
      does not understand TTL\n   TLVs, it will simply ignore the TLV, as is the case
      for all optional\n   TLVs.  If the TTL TLV is not present or is not processed
      by the\n   receiver, any determination of the TTL value used in the MPLS label\n
      \  on the LSP-Ping echo reply is beyond the scope of this document.\n   If the
      TTL TLV is present and the receiver understands TTL TLVs, one\n   of the following
      two conditions apply:\n   o  If the TTL TLV value field is zero, the LSP-Ping
      echo request\n      packet SHOULD be dropped.\n   o  Otherwise, the receiver
      MUST use the TTL value specified in the\n      TTL TLV when it creates the MPLS
      header of the MPLS Echo Reply.\n      The TTL value in the TTL TLV takes precedence
      over any TTL value\n      determined by other means, such as from the Switching
      Point TLV in\n      the MS-PW.  This precedence will aid the originator of the
      LSP-\n      Ping echo request in analyzing the return path.\n"

    an MPLS\n   MS-PW.\n            <------------------MS-PW --------------------->\n
    \           A          B          C           D           E\n            o --------

    \                      <--MPLS Echo Reply------\n            Figure 2: Use-Case
    with MS-PWs\n   Let us assume an MS-PW going through LSRs A, B, C, D, and E.\n
    \  Furthermore, assume that an operator wants to perform a connectivity\n   check
    between B and D, from B.  Thus, an MPLS Echo Request with the\n   TTL TLV is originated
    from B and sent towards D.  The MPLS Echo\n   Request packet contains the FEC
    of the PW Segment between C and D.\n   The value field of the TTL TLV and the
    TTL field of the MPLS label\n   are set to 2, the choice of the value 2 will be
    based on the operator\n   input requesting the MPLS Echo Request or from the optional
    LDP\n   switching point TLV.  The MPLS Echo Request is intercepted at D\n   because
    of TTL expiry.  D detects the TTL TLV in the request and uses\n   the TTL value
    (i.e., 2) specified in the TLV on the MPLS label of the\n   MPLS Echo Reply.  The
    MPLS Echo Reply will be intercepted by B\n   because of TTL expiry.\n   The same
    operation will apply when we have a co-routed bidirectional\n   LSP and we want
    to check connectivity from an intermediate LSR \"B\" to\n   another LSR \"D\".\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Traceroute Mode\n   In traceroute mode, the TTL value in the TLV is set
      to 1 for the\n   first Echo Request, then to 2 for the next, and so on.  This
      is\n   similar to the TTL values used for the label set on the packet.\n"
    title: 4.1.  Traceroute Mode
  - contents:
    - "4.2.  Error Scenario\n   It is possible that the MPLS Echo Request packet was
      intercepted\n   before the intended destination for reasons other than label
      TTL\n   expiry.  This could be due to network faults, misconfiguration, or\n
      \  other reasons.  In such cases, if the return TTL is set to the value\n   specified
      in the TTL TLV, then the echo response packet will continue\n   beyond the originating
      node.  This becomes a security issue.\n   To prevent this, the label TTL value
      used in the MPLS Echo Reply\n   packet MUST be modified by deducting the incoming
      label TTL on the\n   received packet from TTL TLV value.  If the MPLS Echo Request
      packet\n   is punted to the CPU before the incoming label TTL is deducted, then\n
      \  another 1 MUST be added.  In other words:\n   Return TTL Value on the MPLS
      Echo Reply packet = (TTL TLV Value) -\n   (Incoming Label TTL) + 1\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document allows the setting of the TTL value
    in the MPLS Label\n   of an MPLS Echo Reply, so that it can be intercepted by
    an\n   intermediate device.  This can cause a device to get a lot of LSP-\n   Ping
    packets that get redirected to the CPU.\n   However, the same is possible even
    without the changes mentioned in\n   this document.  A device should rate limit
    the LSP-Ping packets\n   redirected to the CPU so that the CPU is not overwhelmed.\n
    \  The recommendation in the Security Considerations of [RFC4379]\n   applies,
    to check the source address of the MPLS Echo Request;\n   however, the source
    address can now be any node along the LSP path.\n   A faulty transit node changing
    the TTL TLV value could make the wrong\n   node reply to the MPLS Echo Request,
    and/or the wrong node to receive\n   the MPLS Echo Reply.  An LSP trace may help
    identify the faulty\n   transit node.\n"
