- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This paper covers basic fundamentals that must be understood when\
    \ one\n   defines, interprets, or implements methods to control user\n   expectations\
    \ on or over the Internet.\n"
- title: 1. Background
  contents:
  - "1. Background\n   User agreements are a form of acceptable use policy (AUP) are\
    \ an\n   implicit part of internetworking since they place parameters on user\n\
    \   expectation.  They define the desired and expected behaviour of those\n  \
    \ who participate.  Everyone has one, whether published or not.  This\n   applies\
    \ to networks that provide transit paths for other networks as\n   well as end\
    \ sites and the individual users that use systems.  A\n   better understanding\
    \ of an AUP, and how to formulate one seems to be\n   increasingly important as\
    \ the global net encompases new  environments\n   as varied as K12 schools and\
    \ real-time systems.  AUP's are used to\n   determine pricing, customer base,\
    \ type and quality of service\n   metrics, and a host of other provider services.\n"
- title: 2. Components of an Agreement
  contents:
  - "2. Components of an Agreement\n   In defining your particular agreement there\
    \ are three areas that must\n   be addressed.  They are where you get service\
    \ from, who your peers\n   are, and whom you provide service to.  A good understanding\
    \ of these\n   concepts will make or break the policies you formulate.\n"
- title: 2.1  Where you get service from
  contents:
  - "2.1  Where you get service from\n   Each entity gets its service from one or\
    \ more other providers,\n   either a level three service, such as IP transit,\
    \ or a level two\n   service, such as circuits.  The provider of such services\
    \ usually has\n   an policy in the form of an agreement or contract specifying\
    \ terms\n   and conditions of use. This forms the basis for the type of service\n\
    \   offerings that you as an entity can provide.  If you get service from\n  \
    \ several providers,  all of them need to be considered in the\n   formation of\
    \ policy.\n"
- title: 2.2 Who your peers are
  contents:
  - "2.2 Who your peers are\n   Are your policies consistent with those offered by\
    \ your peers?  In\n   many cases, the formation of policy will define who your\
    \ peers are.\n   It is important to clearly identify which areas you intend to\
    \ reach\n   and the community you wish to be a contributing, productive part of.\n\
    \   Once this is clear, formulate polices along those lines.\n"
- title: 2.3 Who you provide service to
  contents:
  - "2.3 Who you provide service to\n   It is required that you inform those who use\
    \ your services just what\n   your policies are.  Without this information, it\
    \ will be almost\n   impossible for them to distinguish what to expect from your\
    \ service\n   offering. Without a clear policy it is possible that litigation\
    \ may\n   ensue. It is important to reflect community standards in the creation\n\
    \   of policy.\n"
- title: 3. Some Issues to consider
  contents:
  - "3. Some Issues to consider\n   IP provided services can be complex.  They comprise\
    \ both information\n   and communication.  In the formulation of policy it is\
    \ critical that\n   the policy provide for security and access to information\
    \ and\n   communication while ensuring that the resource use does not\n   overburden\
    \ the system's capabilities. These conflicting demands must\n   be analyzed and\
    \ a synthesis arrived at.  This hints a fourth\n   component of an AUP, that it\
    \ has a method to extract compliance.\n   This is so site specific that further\
    \ analysis will not be attempted\n   here.\n   Some items that should be considered\
    \ in the formation of policy are:\n        - privacy                       - morals\
    \ & ethics\n        - freedom of expression         - legal constraints\n    \
    \    - safety                        - harassment\n        - plagiarism      \
    \              - resource utilization\n        - indemnification             \
    \  - targeted areas of interest\n        - expected behaviours           - remedies\
    \ and recourse\n   This should not be considered as an exhaustive list but as\
    \ pointers\n   for those types of things to be considered when policy is formed.\n"

- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The next five years will radically change the ways that schools\n\
    \   relate to the world around them as global computer networks--long the\n  \
    \ exclusive domain of higher education and private industry--link up to\n   primary\
    \ and secondary schools. The Internet, a network made up of\n   many smaller contributing\
    \ networks, represents a powerful educational\n   resource unlike anything that\
    \ precedes it. Its potential for\n   education grows with the establishment of\
    \ each new connection.\n   For the first time, schoolchildren have the means for\
    \ simple, direct\n   contact with millions of adults in a forum that masks their\
    \ physical\n   youth and presents them as virtual equals. However, just as the\
    \ new\n   kid in school has to learn new social codes and rituals to fit in,\n\
    \   schools must learn some of the practices and etiquette of the\n   Internet.\
    \ Of course, the established denizens of the Internet will\n   soon have some\
    \ adjusting to do as well, with thousands (or millions)\n   of new kids knocking\
    \ electronically at their doors. Since the\n   Internet was not designed with\
    \ children in mind, many potentially\n   difficult issues must be discussed by\
    \ both the education and the\n   Internet communities.\n   This article presents\
    \ a framework for thinking about some of the\n   issues that are essential to\
    \ making the initial encounter between\n   schools and the Internet successful.\
    \ It also presents an excerpt of a\n   policy that embodies our approach to resolving\
    \ those issues.\n"
- title: Expanding Access, Expanding Horizons
  contents:
  - "Expanding Access, Expanding Horizons\n   For roughly the past decade, schools\
    \ increasingly have participated\n   in specialized computer networks such as\
    \ the NGS/TERC Kidsnetwork,\n   the Intercultural Learning Network, and FidoNet,\
    \ as well as for-\n   profit services such as CompuServe, America Online, and\
    \ Prodigy. The\n   majority of these projects were conducted on networks, where\n\
    \   teachers' or students' messages could not be read by anyone beyond a\n   predetermined\
    \ audience composed of other students and teachers. These\n   projects made it\
    \ possible for students and teachers to communicate\n   with their peers in faraway\
    \ places and pioneered some pedagogical\n   uses of networks for computer-mediated\
    \ communication and\n   collaborative project work that will carry over to the\
    \ Internet.\n   Internetworking, however, goes beyond proprietary systems by joining\n\
    \   a vast number of distinct networks into one large network, the\n   Internet.\
    \  As individual schools and bulletin boards are connected to\n   the Internet,\
    \ the number of people and services within easy reach\n   increases exponentially.\
    \ By one estimate, there are currently 19\n   million users of the Internet, with\
    \ an annual growth rate approaching\n   80 percent. Furthermore, some of the Internet's\
    \ most powerful\n   communication tools are specifically designed so that any\
    \ of these\n   millions of people could join any conversation. The network's true\n\
    \   power comes from the synergy of many dispersed minds working together\n  \
    \ to solve problems and discuss issues, and there is little in the way\n   of\
    \ hierarchy or control of the discourse.\n   The schools' shift to internetworking\
    \ systems involves critical\n   technological, as well as pedagogical, issues.\
    \ It requires a change\n   in the school computing paradigm from centralized computing\
    \ to\n   distributed client-server systems, thus bringing about an\n   administrative\
    \ change in the nature of school computing. Many schools\n   that currently have\
    \ some kind of network access provide accounts only\n   to teachers or administrators.\
    \ Internetworking is fundamentally\n   different--giving accounts, access, and\
    \ therefore control directly to\n   students.\n   There are numerous arguments\
    \ for the pedagogical benefits of school\n   internetworking. But what of the\
    \ risks? What safety, liability, and,\n   above all, educational concerns must\
    \ be addressed before schools are\n   ready to tap into the Internet? This policy\
    \ is not intended as a\n   document that sets limitations or restrictions. Rather,\
    \ it is\n   designed to facilitate and set guidelines for exploring and using\
    \ the\n   Internet as a tool for learning. The policy was written with the\n \
    \  purpose and goals of the Internet as a background: support for open\n   research\
    \ and education in and among research and instructional\n   institutions. The\
    \ context for the policy was provided by the specific\n   needs of a growing community\
    \ of learners composed of students,\n   teachers, scientists, and researchers.\
    \ The networked environment must\n   support collaboration and cooperation. Proper\
    \ frameworks to support\n   network navigation and information searching must\
    \ be established. And\n   because networks will continue to be a scarce educational\
    \ resource\n   for the foreseeable future, the policy also provides guidelines\
    \ for\n   maximizing the educational cost-benefit ratio for teachers and\n   students.\n"
- title: Testbed for Change--The CoVis Project
  contents:
  - "Testbed for Change--The CoVis Project\n   Our framework for considering internetworking\
    \ issues is a project\n   currently being conducted at the School of Education\
    \ and Social\n   Policy at Northwestern University. The Learning Through Collaborative\n\
    \   Visualization Project, CoVis, is designed to reconceptualize and\n   reconfigure\
    \ high school science education. CoVis is a networking\n   testbed funded by the\
    \ National Science Foundation (NSF). Its goal is\n   to enable project-based approaches\
    \ to science by using low- and\n   medium-bandwidth networks to put students in\
    \ direct contact with\n   practicing scientists and scientific tools. In CoVis,\
    \ we are working\n   with the types of network connections we believe will be\
    \ common in\n   schools in the near future.\n   In the first phase of our project\
    \ we are working with two Chicago-\n   area schools, Evanston Township High School\
    \ in Evanston and New Trier\n   High School in Winnetka. CoVis is deployed in\
    \ 12 classes at the two\n   high schools, involving three teachers at each school.\
    \ Approximately\n   300 students are involved in the project: 100 freshmen, 100\n\
    \   sophomores and juniors, and 100 seniors, all enrolled in either earth\n  \
    \ science or environmental science classes. Each classroom contains six\n   Macintosh\
    \ Quadra computers with audio/video conferencing units linked\n   to an internal\
    \ ethernet, which is linked to Northwestern's ethernet\n   by a primary-rate Integrated\
    \ Services Digital Network bridge for\n   telecommunications using the public-switched\
    \ network. Additional\n   computers are available for Internet use in computer\
    \ labs at each\n   school.\n   The CoVis Network Community consists of students\
    \ and teachers in\n   CoVis classes, scientists who wish to collaborate on CoVis\
    \ student\n   projects, the researchers conducting the CoVis project, and other\n\
    \   interested parties who are granted special accounts. In the CoVis\n   classroom,\
    \ each student is given an account that makes him or her a\n   \"full\" member\
    \ of the Internet community. This means two things: Each\n   student has access\
    \ to all Internet services with minimal mediation by\n   teachers or other adults,\
    \ and anybody with an Internet account can\n   contact the students directly,\
    \ again without mediation.\n   In addition to the standard Internet resources,\
    \ which include\n   electronic mail, listservs, Usenet news discussion groups,\
    \ Telnet,\n   gopher, and file transfer, CoVis makes it possible for students\
    \ to\n   communicate with peers and scientists via video and audio conference\n\
    \   tools and remote screen-sharing technology for synchronous\n   collaborative\
    \ work. Therefore, the CoVis Network Use Policy goes\n   beyond the needs of the\
    \ typical low-bandwidth internetworked school.\n   As an NSF testbed, CoVis has\
    \ the job of developing new frameworks for\n   the use of internetworking. In\
    \ seeking to understand problematic\n   issues of networking, we turn both to\
    \ other projects--Bolt Beranek\n   and Newman's work with the Ralph Bunche computer-minischool\
    \ in New\n   York; AT&T's Learning Circles; and TERC's LabNet project--and to\n\
    \   analogous situations extant in schools. Our attention thus is placed\n   on\
    \ the development of a policy to establish ground rules for the\n   students who\
    \ will be introduced to the Internet.\n"
- title: The Need for a Proactive Policy
  contents:
  - "The Need for a Proactive Policy\n   Exciting or revolutionary educational programs\
    \ too often are\n   derailed.  In the 1970s, Jerome Bruner's curriculum Man: A\
    \ Course of\n   Study (MACOS) was at the center of a political and ideological\n\
    \   firestorm that prevented its implementation in many schools. The\n   experience\
    \ of the MACOS developers taught us that it makes sense to\n   spend time in the\
    \ initial stages of a project trying to determine\n   what challenges might arise\
    \ to an educational innovation in order to\n   avoid, preempt, or co-opt them.\n\
    \   In March 1993, the Communications Policy Forum, a nonpartisan group\n   of\
    \ telecommunications stakeholders convened by the Electronic\n   Frontier Foundation,\
    \ met on the issues of Internet services for the\n   K-12 educational community.\
    \ The forum concluded that services should\n   be provided only to schools that\
    \ would indemnify the service\n   providers.  It also recommended that a warning\
    \ statement be developed\n   to advise schools of the presence of materials on\
    \ the Internet that\n   may be deemed inappropriate for minors.\n   We believe\
    \ that it is not enough to devise a policy designed to\n   protect schools and\
    \ service providers, although our policy also\n   speaks to those roles. In this\
    \ policy designed to guide students\n   through some of the social complexity\
    \ presented by the Internet, we\n   created guidelines to alert novice users of\
    \ established expectations\n   and practices. Because the Internet is somewhat\
    \ anarchic in its daily\n   commerce, it is necessary to define a safe local space,\
    \ or identity,\n   for a school network where students can feel like members of\
    \ a\n   supportive community. The goal of establishing the boundaries of our\n\
    \   own community forms the framework of our policy.\n"
- title: Issues and Analogies
  contents:
  - "Issues and Analogies\n   The kinds of issues posed by internetworking are not\
    \ new. Similar\n   issues have been debated by schools many times before, from\
    \ creation\n   science to dress codes. These concerns resurface in the availability\n\
    \   of networked material that some parents, teachers, or students might\n   find\
    \ objectionable, pornographic, or otherwise inappropriate.\n   Although the actual\
    \ percentage of materials in this category is\n   small, their mere presence draws\
    \ plenty of media attention. Consider\n   this lead-in to a story about graphic\
    \ material that can be retrieved\n   through the Internet, published in the Houston\
    \ Chronicle in 1990:\n      \"Westbury High School student Jeff Noxon's homework\
    \ was rudely\n      interrupted recently when he stumbled across the world's most\n\
    \      sophisticated pornography ring....It was supported by taxes and\n     \
    \ brought into town by the brightest lights of higher education.\"\n   While some\
    \ are shocked, an alternative interpretation might point out\n   that in using\
    \ a valuable resource provided by the local university, a\n   high school student\
    \ chose to view material that many (including\n   regular Internet users) find\
    \ objectionable. Educators must understand\n   that, as a byproduct of introducing\
    \ internetworking, schools likely\n   will have to justify student use of network\
    \ resources to a public\n   that does not understand the medium or its utility\
    \ to education. By\n   seeking out analogous situations and applying them to the\
    \ development\n   of our network use policy, we believe it is possible to establish\n\
    \   frameworks for responding to these challenges. We found several\n   significant\
    \ analogies.\n   * American Library Association (ALA). In considering information\n\
    \   access issues, the most striking and informative analogy is to a\n   remarkable\
    \ set of documents built around the ALA's Library Bill of\n   Rights of 1980.\
    \ It is not farfetched to consider the Internet, at\n   least in part, as a vast\
    \ digital library. After all, the electronic\n   database and information search\
    \ tools it employs are rapidly becoming\n   part of new school media centers,\
    \ and many public and school\n   libraries are beginning to offer some type of\
    \ network access to their\n   patrons.\n   The ALA documents state, \"Attempts\
    \ to restrict access to library\n   materials violate the basic tenets of the\
    \ Library Bill of Rights.\"\n   However, they add, what goes into the library\
    \ collection should be\n   chosen thoughtfully and with an eye toward instructional\
    \ goals.\n   School librarians are bound to devise collections that \"are\n  \
    \ consistent with the philosophy, goals, and objectives of the school\n   district,\"\
    \ and they must \"resist efforts by individuals to define\n   what is appropriate\
    \ for all students or teachers to read, view, or\n   hear.\" Similarly, tools\
    \ used to access the network must be designed\n   to direct access to materials\
    \ that support curricular concerns. Thus,\n   the interface to the network embodies\
    \ the notion of a library\n   collection. In a school network policy, the \"intent\
    \ of the\n   collection\" should be clearly reflected in a statement of purpose\
    \ for\n   the network.\n   Directly addressing the information access needs of\
    \ children, the ALA\n   opposes attempts to limit access based on the age of a\
    \ library user.\n   \"Librarians and governing bodies should maintain that parents--and\n\
    \   only parents--have the right and the responsibility to restrict the\n   access\
    \ of their children--and only their children--to library\n   resources,\" it states.\n\
    \   While we in the CoVis Project have some ability technologically to\n   restrict\
    \ what is in our Internet \"collection,\" it is virtually\n   impossible to prevent\
    \ students from accessing materials whose\n   presence we never anticipated while\
    \ preserving the students' status\n   as full members of the Internet community.\
    \ In this way, the Internet\n   is fundamentally different from a relatively static\
    \ library\n   collection.  Following the lead of the ALA, however, we believe\
    \ that\n   the precise limits placed upon students' access cannot be formalized\n\
    \   by the school policy. Instead, it is the students' responsibility to\n   adhere\
    \ to the standards set by their parents.\n   * American Society for Information\
    \ Science (ASIS). The code of ethics\n   of ASIS provides another informative\
    \ analogy, this one speaking to\n   issues of professionals' responsibilities\
    \ to both individuals and\n   society. Where individuals are concerned, information\
    \ professionals-\n   -a designation we believe should be applied to teachers--must\
    \ strive\n   both to \"protect each information user's and provider's right to\n\
    \   privacy and confidentiality\" and \"respect an information provider's\n  \
    \ proprietary rights.\" With respect to society, information\n   professionals\
    \ should \"serve the legitimate information needs of a\n   large and complex society\
    \ while at the same time being mindful of\n   [the] individual's rights.\" They\
    \ also should \"resist efforts to\n   censor publications.\"\n   The ASIS code\
    \ speaks directly to issues of electronic mail privacy.\n   We believe that students\
    \ and teachers must feel certain that their\n   communications are private. In\
    \ many electronic mail systems currently\n   used in schools, the teacher must\
    \ act as an intermediary between the\n   school and the outside world. When students\
    \ are \"full\" members of the\n   Internet, mail is sent directly to the outside\
    \ world with no human\n   mediation. As a rule, such communications should be\
    \ private, and the\n   network policy must make explicit any reasons for teachers\
    \ or\n   researchers to have access to message content. Users must be made\n \
    \  aware of times and circumstances under which private mail may be\n   monitored.\n\
    \   * Prodigy. Privacy in electronic mail communications seems like a\n   straightforward\
    \ issue--it is analogous to the U.S. mail. But what\n   about network bulletin\
    \ boards or Internet newsgroups? Posting a\n   message in one of these public\
    \ information exchanges may raise\n   questions of freedom of expression among\
    \ students and other network\n   users, but no more than in any other public forum.\n\
    \   One approach to dealing with this issue was described in the Wall\n   Street\
    \ Journal's technology supplement of November 15, 1993. Prodigy,\n   a dial-up\
    \ bulletin-board service jointly owned by IBM and Sears, has\n   a strict editorial\
    \ policy for both its public forums and its members'\n   private email exchanges.\
    \ Prodigy employs editors who screen every\n   message before it is posted, sometimes\
    \ delaying posting by up to 40\n   hours. It also uses special software to screen\
    \ messages for what it\n   deems objectionable language. The result is a lowest-common-\n\
    \   denominator approach to what is acceptable or unacceptable material.\n   This\
    \ approach undervalues the maturity of Prodigy's users. In the\n   CoVis classroom,\
    \ we want to strive to develop students' maturity, and\n   in order to learn these\
    \ lessons, they must feel that their message\n   content is under their own control.\
    \ To let students know what level\n   of behavior is expected of them, we are\
    \ very clear about the use of\n   offensive, obscene, or inflammatory language\
    \ on the network. These\n   guidelines are not unfamiliar to the students in CoVis,\
    \ as their\n   local school codes of conduct include the same admonitions. Offensive\n\
    \   messages posted by students are not ejected from the network.\n   However,\
    \ students can lose their privileges on the network if they\n   post such messages\
    \ (a significant disincentive for CoVis students),\n   and they are encouraged\
    \ to post a retraction or apology once they\n   understand why their message was\
    \ problematic. These interventions are\n   only initiated upon the complaint of\
    \ another user, not as part of an\n   explicit editorial policy.\n   * School\
    \ Conduct Codes. Every school has a code of conduct for its\n   students that\
    \ details appropriate school behavior, outlines rights,\n   and sets expectations\
    \ for students. Because the CoVis Network is used\n   as part of a school activity,\
    \ the school's code of conduct applies to\n   network activities. Thus, we believe\
    \ the network use policy should be\n   an extension of the school's policies.\
    \ An important part of the\n   development of the CoVis Network use policy was\
    \ a close reading of\n   the participating high schools' codes of conduct. For\
    \ example, at one\n   of our high schools, special rules against vandalism of\
    \ computer\n   equipment and unauthorized access to information exist. These rules\n\
    \   cover such important concepts as computer piracy, hacking, and other\n   tampering\
    \ with hardware or software. Both CoVis schools have codes\n   warning students\
    \ that use of harassing or abusive language is\n   unacceptable, as is obscenity.\
    \ At the same time, both high schools\n   place a high value on students' right\
    \ to freedom of expression and\n   outline the dimensions of that right in some\
    \ detail.\n   * Field Trips. All of the rules that apply to student conduct in\n\
    \   school also apply when the students are off campus on field trips.\n   The\
    \ Internet offers many opportunities for virtual field trips to\n   distant locations,\
    \ and CoVis adds a new twist to this genre with the\n   addition of full audio\
    \ and video connections to remote locations.\n   Students in the CoVis community\
    \ will be able to \"visit\" the\n   Exploratorium in San Francisco, directing\
    \ a remote camera around the\n   exhibit floor and engaging in conversations with\
    \ guides and other\n   museum visitors. It is important that students realize\
    \ they act as\n   ambassadors for their school in such encounters, and our policy\n\
    \   states this explicitly.  Currently, parental permission slips are\n   required\
    \ before students may take field trips. At one of our\n   participating high schools,\
    \ such slips are required even for \"trips\"\n   within the school building. Is\
    \ there a precedent for extending the\n   concept of permission slips to the virtual\
    \ field trip? We do not\n   believe so, but we do recognize the importance of\
    \ written information\n   alerting parents to interesting or innovative school\
    \ activities.\n"

    \ developments that make the Internet accessible to schools.\n   This is accomplished\
    \ in part through commercial networks such as\n   America Online and Delphi and\
    \ by the decreasing costs of modems and\n   communications software. With the\

  contents:
  - "A.  Mission Statement\n   The Learning Through Collaborative Visualization Project\
    \ (CoVis) was\n   established to explore project-enhanced science learning supported\
    \ by\n   advanced computing applications in a secondary school environment.\n\
    \   As such, the computer network environment supported by the project\n   (the\
    \ CoVis Network) is designed to enhance the learning and teaching\n   activities\
    \ of the participating science classrooms at New Trier and\n   Evanston Township\
    \ High Schools.  The term \"network\" in this document\n   refers to a number\
    \ of computers and other electronic tools that are\n   connected to each other\
    \ for the purpose of communication and data\n   sharing.  CoVis is a National\
    \ Science Foundation (NSF) funded\n   research project, and use of the network\
    \ is therefore provided to\n   allow the study of its impact on learning and teaching.\n\
    \   1.  Purpose of the Internet\n      The Internet (a global network made up\
    \ of many smaller\n      contributing networks) and its services are intended\
    \ to support\n      open research and education in and among US research and\n\
    \      instructional institutions, plus research arms of for-profit firms\n  \
    \    when engaged in open scholarly communication and research.  Use\n      for\
    \ other purposes, e.g., for-profit activity or extensive\n      personal business,\
    \ is not acceptable.\n   2.  Purpose of the CoVis Network\n      The purpose of\
    \ the CoVis Network is to facilitate communications\n      and collaboration between\
    \ members of the CoVis community.  Network\n      use is primarily intended for\
    \ the support of project work\n      conducted for participating CoVis classes,\
    \ and far less\n      significantly for other purposes that students and teachers\n\
    \      determine to be of educational value.  The CoVis Network has\n      limited\
    \ resources, and CoVis classrooms have limited time\n      available for network-\
    \ supported teaching and learning activities.\n      Any use of the network which\
    \ adversely affects its operation in\n      pursuit of teaching and learning or\
    \ jeopardizes its use or\n      performance for other community members is prohibited,\
    \ and may\n      result in the loss of network privileges.\n"
- title: B.  Services Available on the CoVis Network
  contents:
  - "B.  Services Available on the CoVis Network\n   The CoVis Network consists of\
    \ a variety of computing equipment,\n   software, and network connections.  This\
    \ section describes the\n   primary tools and services approved for use in the\
    \ CoVis Network.\n   Other tools may be used, but may not be supported by the\
    \ system\n   administrators:\n      1.  Cruiser Videoconferencing.  Cruiser is\
    \ a tool designed to\n      allow video and audio connections between two people,\
    \ each of whom\n      must have a Cruiser station and access to the CoVis network.\n\
    \      Cruiser conversations are private;\n      2.  Timbuktu Screen-Sharing.\
    \  Timbuktu is a commercial software\n      product that allows a Macintosh user\
    \ to view or control another\n      Macintosh computer remotely (with the remote\
    \ user's permission).\n      This is designed to allow two or more people to work\
    \ together over\n      the CoVis Network. Timbuktu sessions are private;\n   \
    \   3.  Collaborative Notebook.  The Notebook is a personal or group\n      workspace\
    \ designed to support project work in CoVis classrooms.\n      Work done using\
    \ the notebook may be either private or public, as\n      designated by the user.\
    \  Users should be careful to note whether\n      they are working in a private\
    \ or a public portion of the notebook.\n      4.  General-Use Internet Tools.\
    \  These include, but are not\n      limited to, the following:\n         a) Electronic\
    \ Mail, or email.  Email is just like regular mail,\n         except instead of\
    \ paper, you use the computer.  Email\n         correspondence is considered private.\
    \  The CoVis Project uses a\n         program called \"Eudora\" for sending and\
    \ receiving mail.\n         b) Listservs.  A listserv is a means to broadcast\
    \ an email\n         message to many users for the purpose of maintaining a\n\
    \         discussion list.  Although listserv messages are transmitted\n     \
    \    via email, correspondence is public, so extra care should be\n         used\
    \ when participating.  The program called \"Eudora\" would be\n         used for\
    \ participating in a listserv.\n         c) Network News.  Netnews is a communications\
    \ tool for large\n         group discussion.  Netnews is essentially similar to\
    \ a\n         listserv, except that it does not use email as the means of\n  \
    \       communication.  Instead, you use software called a \"news\n         reader\"\
    \ to read and post messages to the appropriate groups.\n         Newsgroups are\
    \ very public, and should be used thoughtfully.\n         The CoVis project employs\
    \ a program called \"NewsWatcher\" for\n         reading and posting news.\n \
    \        d) File Transfer Protocol, or FTP.  File Transfer Protocol is a\n   \
    \      means of moving files between computers on the Internet. The\n        \
    \ CoVis project employs a program called \"Fetch\" for doing this.\n         e)\
    \ Telnet.  Telnet allows you to connect to other computers on\n         the Internet,\
    \ provided you know the machine's Internet address\n         and appropriate password.\
    \  All provisions of this document\n         apply to members of the CoVis community\
    \ while using remote\n         computers via Telnet.  The CoVis Project uses a\
    \ program called\n         \"NCSA Telnet\" for telnetting operations.\n      \
    \   f) Gopher.  Gopher is a means of navigating the Internet via a\n         menu-driven\
    \ or point-and-click interface to the computer.\n         Gopher is a very convenient\
    \ way to retrieve files and\n         information from sources all around the\
    \ globe. For most\n         purposes, it may be considered an easier form of FTP\
    \ and can be\n         used to initiate Telnet sessions.  The CoVis Project uses\
    \ a\n         program called \"TurboGopher\" for gopher searching.\n"
- title: C.  Who is a member of the CoVis community?
  contents:
  - "C.  Who is a member of the CoVis community?\n   All account holders on the CoVis\
    \ Network will be granted access to\n   all services the network offers.  The\
    \ following people may hold\n   accounts on the CoVis Network:\n      1.  Students.\
    \  Students who are currently enrolled in a CoVis\n      class will automatically\
    \ be granted a network account upon\n      agreement to the terms stated in this\
    \ policy;\n      2.  Teachers.  Teachers of CoVis classes may hold accounts on\
    \ the\n      CoVis Network.  Other teachers may apply for accounts;\n      3.\
    \  Scientists.  Scientists who wish to collaborate on student\n      projects\
    \ will be granted CoVis Network accounts.  The exact nature\n      of the account\
    \ (i.e., which services are available) will depend on\n      individual circumstances;\n\
    \      4.  Researchers.  The researchers conducting the CoVis project\n      will\
    \ hold accounts on the CoVis network;\n      5.  Others.  Anyone may request a\
    \ special account on the CoVis\n      network.  These requests will be granted\
    \ on a case-by-case basis,\n      depending on need and resource availability.\n\
    \      Note: Except in special cases listed above, people from the larger\n  \
    \    Internet community are not part of the local CoVis community, and\n     \
    \ will probably be unaware of the existence of this policy.\n      However, you\
    \ should always treat people you \"meet\" on the network\n      with respect,\
    \ as if they were a part of your community.\n"
- title: D.  Privileges and Rights of CoVis Network Community Members
  contents:
  - "D.  Privileges and Rights of CoVis Network Community Members\n   Members of the\
    \ CoVis community have certain network privileges and\n   rights.  These include:\n\
    \      1.  Privacy.  All members of the CoVis community have the right to\n  \
    \    privacy in their email, Cruiser, Timbuktu, and notebook\n      communications\
    \ when so designated by the user. However, if a user\n      is believed to be\
    \ in violation of the guidelines stated in this\n      policy, a system administrator\
    \ or teacher may need to gain access\n      to private correspondence or files.\
    \  An attempt will be made to\n      notify the user of such inspections whenever\
    \ possible.  As CoVis\n      is primarily a research project, researchers may\
    \ periodically make\n      requests to study or view correspondence and files,\
    \ but\n      confidentiality is ensured in such circumstances.  Also, it is\n\
    \      important that users recognize the fundamental differences between\n  \
    \    public (e.g., news) and private (e.g., email) forms of\n      communication,\
    \ and shape their content accordingly;\n      2.  Equal Access.  All members of\
    \ the CoVis community will be\n      granted free and equal access to as many\
    \ network services as their\n      technology allows.  Exploration of the Internet\
    \ is encouraged\n      relative to the purposes of the CoVis Network;\n      3.\
    \  Safety.  To the greatest extent possible, members of the CoVis\n      community\
    \ will be protected from harassment or unwanted or\n      unsolicited contact.\
    \  Any community member who receives\n      threatening or unwelcome communications\
    \ should bring them to the\n      attention of a system administrator or teacher.\
    \  Users must,\n      however, be aware that there are many services available\
    \ on the\n      Internet that could potentially be offensive to certain groups\
    \ of\n      users.  The designers of the CoVis Network cannot eliminate access\n\
    \      to all such services, nor could they even begin to identify them.\n   \
    \   Thus individual users must take responsibility for their own\n      actions\
    \ in navigating the network;\n      4.  Intellectual Freedom.  The CoVis Network\
    \ must be a free and\n      open forum for expression, including viewpoints that\
    \ are strange,\n      unorthodox, or unpopular.  The network administrators will\
    \ place\n      no official sanctions upon the expression of personal opinion on\n\
    \      the network.  However, the poster of an opinion should be aware\n     \
    \ that other community members may be openly critical of such\n      opinions.\
    \   Occasionally, a message that you post may be met from\n      outside the CoVis\
    \ community with especially harsh criticism (a\n      practice known as \"flaming\"\
    ).  It is best not to respond to such\n      attacks, unless you believe you are\
    \ capable of a measured,\n      rational reply.  Personal attacks are not an acceptable\
    \ use of the\n      CoVis Network at any time. The CoVis Project does not officially\n\
    \      endorse any opinions stated on the network.  Any statement of\n      personal\
    \ belief is implicitly understood to be representative of\n      the author's\
    \ individual point of view, and not that of the CoVis\n      Network, its administrators,\
    \ or the participating high schools.\n"
- title: E.  Responsibilities of CoVis Network Community Members
  contents:
  - "E.  Responsibilities of CoVis Network Community Members\n   With the rights and\
    \ privileges of membership in the CoVis Network\n   community come certain responsibilities.\
    \  Users need to familiarize\n   themselves with these responsibilities.  Failure\
    \ to follow them may\n   result in the loss of network privileges.  These responsibilities\n\
    \   include:\n      1.  Using appropriate language.  Profanity or obscenity will\
    \ not\n      be tolerated on the CoVis Network.  All community members should\n\
    \      use language appropriate for school situations as indicated by\n      school\
    \ codes of conduct;\n      2.  Avoiding offensive or inflammatory speech.  Community\
    \ members\n      must respect the rights of others both in the local community\
    \ and\n      in the Internet at large.  Personal attacks are an unacceptable\n\
    \      use of the network.  If you are the victim of a \"flame,\" take time\n\
    \      to respond rationally, and bring the incident to the attention of\n   \
    \   a teacher or system administrator;\n      3.  Adhering to the rules of copyright.\
    \  CoVis community members\n      must respect all copyright issues regarding\
    \ software, information,\n      and attributions of authorship.  The unauthorized\
    \ copying or\n      transfer of copyrighted materials may result in the loss of\n\
    \      network privileges;\n      4.  Re-posting personal communications without\
    \ the original\n      author's prior consent is prohibited.  To do this is a violation\n\
    \      of the author's privacy.  However, all messages posted in a public\n  \
    \    forum such as newsgroups or listservs may be copied in subsequent\n     \
    \ communications, so long as proper attribution is given;\n      5.  Use of the\
    \ network for any illegal activities is prohibited.\n      Illegal activities\
    \ include tampering with computer hardware or\n      software, unauthorized entry\
    \ into computers, or knowledgeable\n      vandalism or destruction of computer\
    \ files. Such activity is\n      considered a crime under state and federal law;\n\
    \      6.  Avoid the knowing or inadvertent spread of computer viruses.\n    \
    \  \"Computer viruses\" are programs that have been developed as\n      pranks,\
    \ and can destroy valuable programs and data.  To reduce the\n      risk of spreading\
    \ a computer virus, do not import files from\n      unknown or disreputable sources.\
    \  If you do obtain software or\n      files from remote sources, follow proper\
    \ procedures to check for\n      viruses before use. Deliberate attempts to degrade\
    \ or disrupt\n      system performance of the CoVis Network or any other computer\n\
    \      system or network on the Internet by spreading computer viruses is\n  \
    \    considered criminal activity under state and federal law;\n      7.  You\
    \ have full responsibility for the use of your account.  All\n      violations\
    \ of this policy that can be traced to an individual\n      account name will\
    \ be treated as the sole responsibility of the\n      owner of that account. \
    \ Under no conditions should you give your\n      password to another user;\n\
    \      8.  Impersonation is not permitted.  Real names must be used,\n      pseudonyms\
    \ are not allowed;\n      9.  Anonymity is not allowed on the CoVis Network. \
    \ As an\n      educational network, we believe that individuals must take\n  \
    \    responsibility for their actions and words;\n      10.  Exemplary behavior\
    \ is expected on 'virtual' field trips. When\n      'visiting' locations on the\
    \ Internet or using the Cruiser or\n      Timbuktu communication tools, CoVis\
    \ community members must conduct\n      themselves as representatives of both\
    \ their respective schools and\n      the CoVis community as a whole.  Conduct\
    \ that is in conflict with\n      the responsibilities outlined in this document\
    \ will be subject to\n      loss of network privileges.\n"
