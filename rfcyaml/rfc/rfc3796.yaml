  - "Abstract\n   This document seeks to record all usage of IPv4 addresses in\n \
    \  currently deployed IETF Operations & Management Area accepted\n   standards.\
    \  In order to successfully transition from an all IPv4\n   Internet to an all\
    \ IPv6 Internet, many interim steps will be taken.\n   One of these steps is the\
    \ evolution of current protocols that have\n   IPv4 dependencies.  It is hoped\
    \ that these protocols (and their\n   implementations) will be redesigned to be\
    \ network address\n   independent, but failing that will at least dually support\
    \ IPv4 and\n   IPv6.  To this end, all Standards (Full, Draft, and Proposed),\
    \ as\n   well as Experimental RFCs, will be surveyed and any dependencies will\n\
    \   be documented.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is part of a set aiming to record all usage\
    \ of IPv4\n   addresses in IETF standards.  In an effort to have the information\
    \ in\n   a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 documents conforming to\n\
    \   the current IETF areas (Application, Internet, Operations &\n   Management,\
    \ Routing, Security, Sub-IP and Transport).\n   For a full introduction, please\
    \ see the introduction [1].\n"
- title: 2.  Document Organization
  contents:
  - "2.  Document Organization\n   The document is organized as described below:\n\
    \   Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis of Full,\n   Draft,\
    \ and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.  Each RFC is\n   discussed in\
    \ its turn starting with RFC 1 and ending with (around)\n   RFC 3100. The comments\
    \ for each RFC are \"raw\" in nature.  That is,\n   each RFC is discussed in a\
    \ vacuum and problems or issues discussed do\n   not \"look ahead\" to see if\
    \ the problems have already been fixed.\n   Section 7 is an analysis of the data\
    \ presented in Sections 3, 4, 5,\n   and 6.  It is here that all of the results\
    \ are considered as a whole\n   and the problems that have been resolved in later\
    \ RFCs are\n   correlated.\n"

  contents:

  contents:
  - "7.  Summary of Results\n   In the initial survey of RFCs, 36 positives were identified\
    \ out of a\n   total of 153, broken down as follows:\n         Standards:    \
    \                     6 out of  15 or 40.00%\n         Draft Standards:      \
    \             4 out of  15 or 26.67%\n         Proposed Standards:           \
    \    26 out of 112 or 23.21%\n         Experimental RFCs:                 0 out\
    \ of  11 or  0.00%\n   Of those identified, many require no action because they\
    \ document\n   outdated and unused protocols, while others are document protocols\n\
    \   that are actively being updated by the appropriate working groups.\n   Additionally\
    \ there are many instances of standards that should be\n   updated but do not\
    \ cause any operational impact if they are not\n   updated.  The remaining instances\
    \ are documented below.\n"
