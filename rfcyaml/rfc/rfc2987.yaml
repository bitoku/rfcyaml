  - "Abstract\n   This document contains the registration for two media feature tags:\n
    \  \"charset\" and \"language\".  These media features allow specification\n   of
    character sets and human languages that can be understood by\n   devices and the
    devices' users.  The templates in this document are\n   derived from RFC 2506.\n"

    feature tag:\n      Ability to display particular charsets as defined in [CHARSET].\n
    \          For most devices, this media feature is usually a capability;\n           that
    is, most devices cannot intelligently process text in a\n           charset that
    is unknown to the device.\n   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:\n
    \     The values are tokens as defined in [CHARSET].  The values can\n           only
    be compared for equality.  Comparison is not case\n           sensitive.\n   The
    feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following\n   applications, protocols,
    services, or negotiation mechanisms:\n       Any protocol that uses media tags\n

    be\n           used in media feature expressions because feature expression\n
    \          manipulation tools may convert aliases to the the principal\n           name
    for the charset.  Even though charset names are not\n           case-sensitive,
    values should be expressed as all lowercase\n           letters to increase the
    likelihood of interoperability.  The\n           \"charset\" capability should
    always be indicated in\n           conjunction with any capability to handle textual
    data.\n   Security considerations:\n      If it is known that there is a security
    bug in the display of a\n      particular charset in a particular environment,
    knowing that a\n      device can accept that charset may slightly help an attacker.\n

    feature tags mailing list)\n   Subject: Registration of media feature tag language\n
    \  Media feature tag name:\n      language\n   ASN.1 identifier associated with
    feature tag:\n      1.3.6.1.8.1.32\n   Summary of the media feature indicated
    by this feature tag:  Ability\n      to display particular human languages as
    defined in [LANG].  Note\n      that \"display\" in this case will most often
    mean speech by a\n      computer.  For most devices, this media feature is a preference,\n
    \     not a requirement.\n   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:\n
    \     The values are tokens, with allowable values defined by\n           registration
    as defined in [LANG].  The values can only be\n           compared for equality.
    \ As described in [LANG], language tags\n           are always handled as a single
    token, and \"subtags\" are not\n           used for comparison.  Comparison is
    not case sensitive.\n   The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following\n
