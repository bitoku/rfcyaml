  - "Introduction\n   This glossary is adapted from \"The INTEROP Pocket Glossary\
    \ of\n   Networking Terms\" produced to help you understand the many terms--and\n\
    \   in particular the myriad of acronyms--that can be encountered at the\n   INTEROP\
    \ Tutorials, Conference, and Exhibition.\n   To keep this document reasonably\
    \ small we have deliberately omitted\n   common computer and communications terms\
    \ such as disk, modem, byte,\n   and VLSI.  In addition, the definitions have\
    \ been kept brief.  We\n   recommend that you consult the glossaries found in\
    \ the major computer\n   networking textbooks for more comprehensive definitions.\n\
    \   We also realize that producing this glossary is akin to shooting at a\n  \
    \ moving target.  The computer and communications industries are moving\n   very\
    \ rapidly, and terms and acronyms are born every day.  You are\n   invited to\
    \ submit words which you think should be included in future\n   editions.\n"

  - "Glossary\n   abstract syntax: A description of a data structure that is\n   independent\
    \ of machine-oriented structures and encodings.\n   ACSE: Association Control\
    \ Service Element.  The method used in OSI\n   for establishing a call between\
    \ two applications.  Checks the\n   identities and contexts of the application\
    \ entities, and could apply\n   an authentication security check.\n   address\
    \ mask: A bit mask used to select bits from an Internet address\n   for subnet\
    \ addressing.  The mask is 32 bits long and selects the\n   network portion of\
    \ the Internet address and one or more bits of the\n   local portion.  Sometimes\
    \ called subnet mask.\n   address resolution: A means for mapping Network Layer\
    \ addresses onto\n   media-specific addresses.  See ARP.\n   ADMD: Administration\
    \ Management Domain.  An X.400 Message Handling\n   System public service carrier.\
    \  Examples: MCImail and ATTmail in the\n   U.S., British Telecom Gold400mail\
    \ in the U.K.  The ADMDs in all\n   countries worldwide together provide the X.400\
    \ backbone.  See PRMD.\n   agent: In the client-server model, the part of the\

    \ OSI language for describing\n   abstract syntax.  See BER.\n   attribute: The\
    \ form of information items provided by the X.500\n   Directory Service.  The\
    \ directory information base consists of\n   entries, each containing one or more\

    \ or more values.  Each\n   directory Read operation can retrieve some or all\
    \ attributes from a\n   designated entry.\n   Autonomous System: Internet (TCP/IP)\
    \ terminology for a collection of\n   gateways (routers) that fall under one administrative\
    \ entity and\n   cooperate using a common Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).  See\n\
    \   subnetwork.\n   backbone: The primary connectivity mechanism of a hierarchical\n\
    \   distributed system.  All systems which have connectivity to an\n   intermediate\
    \ system on the backbone are assured of connectivity to\n   each other.  This\
    \ does not prevent systems from setting up private\n   arrangements with each\
    \ other to bypass the backbone for reasons of\n   cost, performance, or security.\n\
    \   Bart Simpson (R): Internet and OSI cult hero.\n   baseband: Characteristic\

    \ all stations attached to the network\n   to participate in every transmission.\
    \  See broadband.\n   BER: Basic Encoding Rules.  Standard rules for encoding\
    \ data units\n   described in ASN.1.  Sometimes incorrectly lumped under the term\n\

    \ more physical networks and\n   forwards packets between them.  Bridges can usually\
    \ be made to filter\n   packets, that is, to forward only certain traffic.  Related\
    \ devices\n   are: repeaters which simply forward electrical signals from one\
    \ cable\n   to another, and full-fledged routers which make routing decisions\n\
    \   based on several criteria.  In OSI terminology, a bridge is a Data\n   Link\
    \ Layer intermediate system.  See repeater and router.\n   broadband: Characteristic\
    \ of any network that multiplexes multiple,\n   independent network carriers onto\
    \ a single cable.  This is usually\n   done using frequency division multiplexing.\
    \  Broadband technology\n   allows several networks to coexist on one single cable;\
    \ traffic from\n   one network does not interfere with traffic from another since\
    \ the\n   \"conversations\" happen on different frequencies in the \"ether,\"\n\
    \   rather like the commercial radio system.\n   broadcast: A packet delivery\
    \ system where a copy of a given packet is\n   given to all hosts attached to\
    \ the network.  Example: Ethernet.\n   BSD: Berkeley Software Distribution.  Term\
    \ used when describing\n   different versions of the Berkeley UNIX software, as\
    \ in \"4.3BSD\n   UNIX.\"\n   catenet: A network in which hosts are connected\
    \ to networks with\n   varying characteristics, and the networks are interconnected\

    \ data addressing (via Transport selector) and error control\n   (via checksum),\
    \ but cannot guarantee delivery or provide flow\n   control.  The OSI equivalent\
    \ of UDP.\n   CMIP: Common Management Information Protocol.  The OSI network\n\
    \   management protocol.\n   CMOT: CMIP Over TCP.  An effort to use the OSI network\
    \ management\n   protocol to manage TCP/IP networks.\n   connectionless: The model\
    \ of interconnection in which communication\n   takes place without first establishing\
    \ a connection.  Sometimes\n   (imprecisely) called datagram.  Examples: LANs,\
    \ Internet IP and OSI\n   CLNP, UDP, ordinary postcards.\n   connection-oriented:\
    \ The model of interconnection in which\n   communication proceeds through three\
    \ well-defined phases: connection\n   establishment, data transfer, connection\
    \ release.  Examples: X.25,\n   Internet TCP and OSI TP4, ordinary telephone calls.\n\
    \   core gateway: Historically, one of a set of gateways (routers)\n   operated\
    \ by the Internet Network Operations Center at BBN.  The core\n   gateway system\
    \ forms a central part of Internet routing in that all\n   groups must advertise\
    \ paths to their networks from a core gateway,\n   using the Exterior Gateway\
    \ Protocol (EGP).  See EGP, backbone.\n   COS: Corporation for Open Systems. \

    \ of\n   names (labels) separated by periods (dots), e.g., \"tundra.mpk.ca.us.\"\
    \n   In OSI, \"domain\" is generally used as an administrative partition of\n\
    \   a complex distributed system, as in MHS Private Management Domain\n   (PRMD),\
    \ and Directory Management Domain (DMD).\n   dotted decimal notation: The syntactic\

    \ to the individual mailboxes in the list.\n   mail gateway: A machine that connects\
    \ two or more electronic mail\n   systems (especially dissimilar mail systems\
    \ on two different\n   networks) and transfers messages between them.  Sometimes\

    \ of the OSI\n   Reference Model.\n   ping: Packet internet groper.  A program\
    \ used to test reachability of\n   destinations by sending them an ICMP echo request\

    \ as modems.\n   proxy ARP: The technique in which one machine, usually a router,\n\
    \   answers ARP requests intended for another machine.  By \"faking\" its\n  \
    \ identity, the router accepts responsibility for routing packets to\n   the \"\
    real\" destination.  Proxy ARP allows a site to use a single IP\n   address with\
    \ two physical networks.  Subnetting would normally be a\n   better solution.\n\
    \   PSN: Packet Switch Node.  The modern term used for nodes in the\n   ARPANET\

    \ system.  See gateway, bridge and repeater.\n   RPC: Remote Procedure Call. \
    \ An easy and popular paradigm for\n   implementing the client-server model of\
    \ distributed computing.  A\n   request is sent to a remote system to execute\
