- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   During IETF meetings, individual volunteers often help sessions\
    \ run\n   more smoothly by relaying information back and forth between the\n \
    \  physical meeting room and an associated textual chatroom.  Because\n   these\
    \ chatrooms are currently implemented using Jabber/XMPP\n   technologies (see\
    \ [RFC6120] and [XEP-0045]), the role is commonly\n   referred to as that of a\
    \ \"Jabber scribe\" (however, nothing prevents\n   the IETF from using some other\
    \ technology for chatrooms in the future\n   or from discontinuing the use of\
    \ chatrooms entirely).\n   This role is important because it is the primary way\
    \ for a remote\n   attendee to provide feedback or comments back into most IETF\
    \ meeting\n   sessions.  Although there are multiple ways that a remote attendee\n\
    \   can listen and follow along, the chatroom provides a method of\n   returning\
    \ feedback to the physical meeting in something close to real\n   time.  These\
    \ methods hold true for IETF working group sessions, IRTF\n   research group sessions,\
    \ IETF \"birds of a feather\" (BoF) sessions,\n   and similar sessions at IETF\
    \ meetings.\n   Based on the authors' personal experience as well as input from\
    \ other\n   individuals who frequently volunteer, this document provides some\n\
    \   suggestions for fulfilling the role of a Jabber scribe at IETF\n   meetings.\n"
- title: 2.  Know Your Users
  contents:
  - "2.  Know Your Users\n   The participants in a chatroom typically fall into three\
    \ categories,\n   labeled here for ease of understanding:\n   o  Remote Participants\n\
    \      Remote attendees who are listening to the audio stream or, in some\n  \
    \    cases, following the proceedings using a real-collaboration system\n    \
    \  (currently exemplified by the Meetecho service).  These\n      participants\
    \ might wish to send questions or feedback to the\n      physical room.\n   o\
    \  Observers\n      IETF meeting attendees who are in another simultaneous session\
    \ in\n      a different physical room.  These participants often monitor the\n\
    \      chatroom to find out when a particular topic is being discussed or\n  \
    \    to observe what is being discussed in the chatroom.  Typically,\n      they\
    \ are not able to listen to the audio stream, and sometimes\n      they ask for\
    \ a higher level of commentary so that they can know\n      when they might need\
    \ to change locations to participate in the\n      session's physical room.\n\
    \   o  Local Participants\n      IETF meeting attendees who are in the same physical\
    \ room.\n      Sometimes these participants like to follow the discussions in\
    \ the\n      physical room and the chatroom at the same time.  They can also\n\
    \      provide some assistance to scribes.\n   It can happen that all of the chatroom\
    \ participants are local\n   participants and thus do not require intensive service\
    \ from a scribe.\n   Feel free to ask in the chatroom to determine if there are\
    \ indeed any\n   remote participants.\n   Chatroom participants are usually identified\
    \ by a \"nickname\" or\n   \"handle\" rather than a full name.  This can be confusing\
    \ to scribes,\n   because they don't always know who is providing comments to\
    \ be\n   relayed.  A scribe ought to ask for clarification so that the\n   identity\
    \ of the remote participant can be communicated at the\n   microphone (see also\
    \ Section 10).  If a remote participant insists on\n   remaining anonymous, it\
    \ is best for the scribe to remind them of the\n   \"Note Well\" [NOTE-WELL] and\
    \ point to that document as a justification\n   for not relaying said comments\
    \ to the meeting.\n"
- title: 3.  Know Yourself
  contents:
  - "3.  Know Yourself\n   Different people have different aptitudes and skills. \
    \ Although some\n   people who volunteer to act as scribes are able to provide\
    \ a fairly\n   complete transcription of what is said and done in the physical\n\
    \   meeting room, that is not the expectation for most volunteers (don't\n   be\
    \ scared off by the word \"scribe\").  Fulfilling the primary tasks\n   described\
    \ in the next section is not a significant burden for most\n   volunteers and\
    \ can be an enjoyable way to participate in a session.\n   This document attempts\
    \ to describe the experience and provide some\n   helpful guidance, but if you\
    \ are thinking about volunteering, then\n   you might also ask other volunteers\
    \ about their experience.  Knowing\n   your aptitudes and skills (e.g., perhaps\
    \ you are not a great typist)\n   can help you understand the level of involvement\
    \ you are comfortable\n   with.\n"
- title: 4.  Primary Tasks
  contents:
  - "4.  Primary Tasks\n   The primary \"customers\" for a scribe are the remote participants,\
    \ and\n   those customers are served in real time.  A scribe can assume that\n\
    \   remote participants have access to at least the audio stream and\n   perhaps\
    \ also video for a session (except in extraordinary\n   circumstances, such as\
    \ when technical problems occur with the\n   streaming facilities).  Even though\
    \ chatroom sessions are logged\n   during IETF meetings and these public logs\
    \ can be a useful adjunct to\n   the historical record, a scribe is not expected\
    \ to transcribe what is\n   said and done during the session.  Instead, the primary\
    \ role of a\n   scribe is to act as a relay between the physical room and the\
    \ remote\n   participants.\n   In particular, individuals who volunteer for the\
    \ role of scribe\n   usually complete the following tasks:\n   o  Relay questions\
    \ and comments from the chatroom to the physical\n      room.  This typically\
    \ involves going to the microphone to relay\n      the comment from the remote\
    \ participant.\n   o  Count or otherwise take account of the number of chatroom\n\
    \      participants who virtually \"hum\", raise their hands, volunteer to\n \
    \     review documents, etc., and feed that information back to the\n      physical\
    \ room.  (Although humming in the physical room provides\n      some level of\
    \ anonymity, that is not true in the chatroom since\n      the only way to register\
    \ one's opinion is to type something like\n      \"hum in favor\"; in this case,\
    \ it is acceptable for the scribe to\n      at least provide a rough count or\
    \ percentage of hums from chatroom\n      participants in order to get a sense\
    \ of the chatroom.)\n   o  Relay information about hums and similar interactions\
    \ from the\n      physical room to the chatroom (preferably after receiving a\n\
    \      \"readout\" from the session chairs).\n   It is the convention in most\
    \ sessions that the scribe has the\n   privilege to go to the front of the microphone\
    \ line to relay\n   information from remote participants.  Some scribes choose\
    \ to\n   exercise that privilege while others choose to wait in line along\n \
    \  with the participants in the physical meeting room.  However, be\n   aware\
    \ that because of the lag (typically 20 seconds to 2 minutes)\n   between in-room\
    \ discussions and the audio stream (as well as the\n   inevitable delay while\
    \ a remote participant types a question or\n   comment to be relayed), it can\
    \ be helpful for the scribe to \"jump the\n   queue\" so that such questions and\
    \ comments are not stale by the time\n   they are relayed to the microphone.\n"
- title: 5.  Additional Tasks
  contents:
  - "5.  Additional Tasks\n   Additionally, some scribes often complete the following\
    \ tasks:\n   o  Relay the names of people speaking in the physical room to the\n\
    \      chatroom.  (To avoid typing the full names of people who speak\n      frequently,\
    \ scribes often use initials but ought to expand the\n      initials on first\
    \ use.)  See Section 6.4 for details.\n   o  Relay the slide numbers or slide\
    \ titles so that it is easier for\n      chatroom participants to follow along.\n\
    \   o  Query remote participants about audio streaming quality, and relay\n  \
    \    such information to the session chairs.\n   o  Relay to the chatroom participants\
    \ any logistical or procedural\n      issues related to the meeting (e.g., known\
    \ technical glitches at\n      the physical meeting or delays in starting the\
    \ session).\n   o  Provide links to the current set of slides and the document\
    \ being\n      discussed so that chatroom participants can easily follow along.\n\
    \   Although scribes are not generally expected to transcribe the\n   complete\
    \ contents of conversations that happen in the physical room\n   to the chatroom,\
    \ they sometimes relay the gist of such conversations,\n   especially during ad\
    \ hoc discussions for which slides are not\n   available.  (By prior arrangement\
    \ between the session chairs and the\n   scribe, actual transcription might be\
    \ expected for particular\n   sessions.)\n"
- title: 6.  Suggestions
  contents:
  - "6.  Suggestions\n   Experience has shown that the following behaviors make it\
    \ easier to\n   act as a scribe.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Getting Set Up with Jabber
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Getting Set Up with Jabber\n   An overview of the IETF Jabber service can\
    \ be found at the IETF\n   Groupchat/Chatroom Service web page [JABBER].  Many\
    \ common instant\n   messaging clients support the Jabber/XMPP protocols, and\
    \ at the time\n   of writing, a list of such clients can be found at the XMPP\
    \ Standards\n   Foundation Software List [XMPPLIST].  Because the IETF Jabber\
    \ service\n   provides chatrooms only and does not enable direct registration\
    \ of\n   user accounts, you will need to create a user account at another\n  \
    \ service; one list of such services can be found at the IM Observatory\n   Server\
    \ Directory [XMPPSERV].  At the time of writing, the Meetecho\n   service used\
    \ at IETF meetings also enables you to join IETF chatrooms\n   directly without\
    \ creating an account at another server.\n   Not all clients support the ability\
    \ to join a chatroom, so you might\n   want to test your preferred software in\
    \ advance of the meeting (the\n   hallway@jabber.ietf.org room is a good place\
    \ to test).  Although the\n   exact user interface for joining a chatroom depends\
    \ on the software\n   you are using, typically such software will have a \"join\
    \ room\" option\n   that prompts you to provide the entire room address (e.g.,\n\
    \   \"hallway@jabber.ietf.org\") or separately provide the name of the room\n\
    \   (e.g., \"hallway\") and the domain of the chatroom service (e.g.,\n   \"jabber.ietf.org\"\
    ).  Asking your fellow IETF participants about their\n   preferred software applications\
    \ can be a good way to learn about\n   Jabber/XMPP clients that you might want\
    \ to use.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Before the Session Begins
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Before the Session Begins\n   If you have volunteered before the session:\n\
    \   o  Coordinate with the chairs to ensure that remote participants have\n  \
    \    received information about where to find the meeting materials,\n      agenda,\
    \ audio stream, etc. (e.g., this information can be sent to\n      a working group\
    \ discussion list so that remote participants do not\n      need to ask about\
    \ it on entering the chatroom).\n   o  Coordinate with the chairs to see if they\
    \ have any special\n      expectations for the scribe (e.g., some chairs might\
    \ want you to\n      transcribe more detailed information about the session proceedings\n\
    \      into the chatroom).\n   o  Ask the session chairs whether it is acceptable\
    \ for you to advance\n      to the front of the microphone line with time-sensitive\
    \ comments\n      from remote participants.\n"
- title: 6.3.  As the Session Is Starting
  contents:
  - "6.3.  As the Session Is Starting\n   As you are getting settled and ready for\
    \ the meeting to start:\n   o  Seat yourself near the microphone most likely to\
    \ be used for\n      discussions in the physical room, so that you can more easily\n\
    \      capture the names of people who come to the microphone.\n      Typically,\
    \ this will be a seat near the end of a row or in some\n      location where you\
    \ can easily get up out of your seat to go to the\n      microphone.\n   o  Start\
    \ up your preferred Jabber client, log into your server, and\n      join the chatroom\
    \ for your session; the addresses are of the form\n      group-name@jabber.ietf.org\
    \ or bof-name@jabber.ietf.org.\n   o  It can be helpful to open several browser\
    \ windows or tabs for:\n      *  the agenda page for the session\n      *  the\
    \ overall agenda page for the IETF meeting (the \"tools-style\n         agenda\"\
    \ can be especially helpful for copying links for\n         session-specific resources\
    \ such as the audio stream)\n      *  the materials page so that you can relay\
    \ links to slides if\n         necessary (at the time of writing, URLs for materials\
    \ related\n         to IETF working groups are of the form\n         \"https://datatracker.ietf.org/\n\
    \         meeting/<nn>/materials.html#<name>\", where \"nn\" is the meeting\n\
    \         number and \"name\" is the acronym for the working group,\n        \
    \ research group, or BoF)\n      *  the documents page for the working group or\

    \ information,\n      etc.\n      Identifying one or more co-scribes is particularly\
    \ useful if you\n      want to go up to the microphone to speak as an individual,\
    \ if you\n      have a presentation to make, or if you need to take a break or\n\
    \      step out of the physical room at some point.  You can work with a\n   \
    \   co-scribe as a temporary stand-in or as someone who shares\n      responsibility\
    \ for scribing throughout the whole meeting.\n"
- title: 6.4.  During the Session
  contents:
  - "6.4.  During the Session\n   As you perform your role during the session:\n \
    \  o  Identify yourself in both the physical room and the chatroom (or\n     \
    \ ask the session chairs to identify you) so that participants in\n      both\
    \ venues know you are a scribe.\n   o  Ask chatroom participants what level of\
    \ information they need\n      relayed into the chatroom.  For example, if all\
    \ chatroom\n      participants are listening via audio or a system like Meetecho,\n\
    \      they might need less information relayed from the room.\n   o  Ask chatroom\
    \ participants to prepend statements they would like\n      you to relay with\
    \ \"RELAY\" or \"MIC\" (the former term is less\n      ambiguous).\n   o  When\
    \ relaying a question or comment from the chatroom to the\n      physical room,\
    \ say \"this is X relaying for Y from the chatroom\" so\n      that people know\
    \ you are not speaking for yourself.\n   o  It's not expected that you will know\
    \ the names of everyone who\n      comes to the microphone.  If you don't know\
    \ the name of a person\n      at the microphone, you have several options:\n \
    \     *  look at their name badge if you are seated nearby\n      *  query them\
    \ directly (calling out \"state your name, please\" is\n         acceptable)\n\
    \      *  ask in the chatroom or type something like \"?? at the mic\",\n    \
    \     since it is likely that a local participant can identify the\n         person\
    \ for you\n      *  if you know part of the attendee's name, look up their full\n\
    \         name in the meeting registration system (at the time of\n         writing,\
    \ this is typically found at a URL of the form\n         \"https://www.ietf.org/registration/<meeting>/attendance.py\"\
    ,\n         such as \"https://www.ietf.org/registration/ietf93/\n         attendance.py\"\
    ); you can quickly look up a name using this\n         system if you are in doubt.\n\
    \   o  Be aware that a lag happens between the time when something is\n      said\
    \ in the physical room and the time when someone provides a\n      response in\
    \ the chatroom, and take this into account when the\n      interaction is time-sensitive\
    \ (e.g., during a hum or a show of\n      hands).\n   o  Because of the lag time,\
    \ ask remote participants who participate\n      in a hum to indicate what choice\
    \ their hum is for rather than just\n      typing \"hum\" into the chatroom. \
    \ For example, \"hum yes\" or \"hum\n      for option 1\".  You can then more\
    \ easily tally the results and\n      report them to the physical room.\n"
- title: 6.5.  As the Session Is Ending
  contents:
  - "6.5.  As the Session Is Ending\n   As you wrap up your scribing at the end of\
    \ the session:\n   o  Post a message into the chatroom informing all of the participants\n\
    \      that the session is finishing up, and ask for any final comments\n    \
    \  to be relayed.\n   o  When the session is done, say so in the chatroom.\n \
    \  o  Indicate that you are leaving the Jabber room and that no one will\n   \
    \   be available to relay further comments.\n"
- title: 7.  Advanced Tips
  contents:
  - "7.  Advanced Tips\n   It can be helpful to run two separate Jabber clients connected\
    \ to two\n   separate Jabber servers, in order to prevent delays if one of the\n\
    \   servers experiences an outage during the session (yes, it has\n   happened).\n\
    \   If you have a chance to do so, you might want to measure the lag time\n  \
    \ between when something is said in the physical room and when it is\n   heard\
    \ on the audio stream and then let the remote participants know\n   the length\
    \ of the delay.  This could be accomplished by either\n   listening to the audio\
    \ stream yourself or working with a remote\n   participant who you know is on\
    \ the audio stream.\n   Sometimes a remote participant has a long discussion with\
    \ someone in\n   the physical room.  In these situations, it can be easier to\
    \ stand at\n   the microphone so that you can relay a series of comments.\n"
- title: 8.  Dealing with Abusive or Inappropriate Behavior
  contents:
  - "8.  Dealing with Abusive or Inappropriate Behavior\n   On occasion, tempers run\
    \ hot and discussions become contentious.  In\n   such situations, comments provided\
    \ in the chatroom might even become\n   abusive or inappropriate.\n   A scribe\
    \ is under no obligation to relay such comments verbatim or to\n   edit them in\
    \ real time at the microphone.  Instead, a suitable\n   approach is ask the contributor\
    \ to rephrase the comments in a more\n   constructive way.\n   That said, a scribe\
    \ is not responsible for managing poor behavior\n   within the session (that responsibility\
    \ lies initially with the\n   chairs) and is not expected to take any specific\
    \ action other than as\n   a regular member of the IETF community.\n"

  - "9.  Reporting Problems at the Meeting Venue\n   At the time of writing, there\

  - "10.  Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)\n   When a chatroom participant makes\
    \ a comment in the chatroom (whether\n   or not it is relayed to the physical\
    \ room), that statement is\n   considered to be a \"contribution\" to the Internet\
    \ Standards Process\n   [RFC2026] and therefore is covered by the provisions of\
    \ BCP 78 (see\n   [RFC5378]) and BCP 79 (see [RFC3979] and [RFC4879]).  A scribe\
    \ does\n   not become a \"contributor\" by the simple fact of relaying such a\n\
    \   contribution, and the primary responsibility for adherence to the\n   IETF's\
    \ IPR policies applies to the person making the comments.\n   However, a scribe\
    \ can help ensure compliance with the IETF's IPR\n   policies by asking chatroom\
    \ participants using an alias to confirm\n   their identities before relaying\
    \ their contributions.\n"

  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   Although XMPP Multi-User Chat [XEP-0045] rooms\
    \ can be configured to\n   lock down nicknames and require registration with the\
    \ chatroom in\n   order to join, at the time of writing, IETF chatrooms are not\
    \ so\n   configured.  This introduces the possibility of social-engineering\n\
    \   attacks on discussions held in IETF chatrooms.  It can be helpful for\n  \
    \ scribes to be aware of this possibility.\n   In addition, denial-of-service\
    \ (DoS) attacks of various kinds are\n   possible, e.g., flooding a chatroom with\
    \ unwanted traffic.\n"
