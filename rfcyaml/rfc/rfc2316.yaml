  - "3. Abstract\n   On 3-5 March 1997, the IAB held a security architecture workshop\
    \ at\n   Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ.  We identified the core security\n   components\
    \ of the architecture, and specified several documents that\n   need to be written.\
    \  Most importantly, we agreed that security was\n   not optional, and that it\
    \ needed to be designed in from the\n   beginning.\n"

- title: 4. Motivations
  contents:
  - "4. Motivations\n   On 3-5 March 1997, the IAB held a security architecture workshop\
    \ at\n   Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ.  The ultimate goal was to design a\n  \
    \ security architecture for the Internet.  More concretely, we wished\n   to understand\
    \ what security tools and protocols exist or are being\n   developed, where each\
    \ is useful, and where we are missing adequate\n   security tools.  Furthermore,\
    \ we wanted to provide useful guidance to\n   protocol designers.  That is, if\
    \ we wish to eliminate the phrase\n   \"security issues are not discussed in this\
    \ memo\" from future RFCs, we\n   must provide guidance on acceptable analyses.\n\
    \   There were twenty-four attendees (their names are listed in Appendix\n   A).\
    \  Perhaps not surprisingly for such a group, the overwhelming\n   majority used\
    \ some form of cryptography when connecting back to their\n   home site from the\
    \ meeting room.  But the situation on the rest of\n   the Internet is not nearly\
    \ as good; few people use encryption, even\n   when they should.\n   The problem\
    \ is that the rate of attacks is increasing.  Apart from\n   the usual few elite\
    \ hackers -- the ones who find the new holes --\n   there are many canned exploit\
    \ scripts around.  (\"Click here to attack\n   this system.\") Furthermore, the\
    \ attackers have gotten smarter; rather\n   than going after random university\
    \ machines, more and more are\n   targeting the Internet infrastructure, such\
    \ as routers, high-level\n   name servers, and the like.\n   The problem is compounded\
    \ by organizational laziness.  Users and\n   system administrators want \"magic\
    \ security\" -- they want whatever\n   they do to be secure, regardless of whether\
    \ or not it is, or even can\n   be.\n"
- title: 5. General Philosophy
  contents:
  - "5. General Philosophy\n   We concluded that in general, end-to-end security is\
    \ better.  Thus,\n   one should use something like PGP or S/MIME for email, rather\
    \ than\n   relying on an IPsec layer.  In general, relying on the security of\n\
    \   the infrastructure is a bad idea; it, too, is under attack.  Even\n   firewall-protected\
    \ intranets can be subverted.  At best, the\n   infrastructure should provide\
    \ availability; it is the responsibility\n   of individual protocols not to make\
    \ unreasonable demands on the\n   infrastructure during an attack.\n"
- title: 6. IETF Structure
  contents:
  - "6. IETF Structure\n   Our security problem is compounded by the IETF's inherent\
    \ structure\n   (or, in some cases, the lack thereof).  By intent, we are a volunteer\n\
    \   organization.  Who should do the security work?  The other protocol\n   designers?\
    \  Often, they have neither the time nor the interest nor\n   the training to\
    \ do it.  Security area members?  What if they are not\n   interested in some\
    \ subject area, or lack the time themselves?  We\n   cannot order them to serve.\n\
    \   To the extent that the IETF does have management, it is embodied in\n   the\
    \ working group charters.  These are in essence contracts between\n   the IESG\
    \ and a working group, spelling out what is to be done and on\n   what schedule.\
    \  Can the IESG unilaterally impose new requirements on\n   existing working groups?\
    \  What if security cannot be added on without\n   substantial changes to the\
    \ fundamental structure of a protocol that\n   has been reworked over several\
    \ years?\n   Finally, there is a perception problem:  that IPsec will somehow\n\
    \   solve the security problem.  It won't; indeed, it can't.  IPsec\n   provides\
    \ excellent protection of packets in transit.  But it's hard\n   to deploy on\
    \ individual hosts, does not protect objects that may be\n   retransmitted (i.e.,\
    \ email messages), does not address authorization\n   issues, cannot block against\
    \ excess resource consumption, etc.\n"
- title: 7. Documents to be Written
  contents:
  - "7. Documents to be Written\n   Collectively, we decided on several documents\
    \ that need to be\n   written:\n      Taxonomy of Attacks\n         In order to\
    \ defend a protocol against attacks, one must, of\n         course, know the kinds\
    \ of attacks that are possible.  While the\n         specifics differ from protocol\
    \ to protocol, a number of general\n         categories can be constructed.\n\
    \      Implementation Hints and Pitfalls\n         Even if a protocol is sound,\
    \ a host running it can be\n         vulnerable if the protocol is implemented\
    \ improperly.  A\n         variety of common errors can and do subvert the best\
    \ designs.\n      Firewall Issues\n         Firewalls are both a common defense\
    \ and a much-reviled wart on\n         the Internet.  Regardless, they are unlikely\
    \ to go away any\n         time soon.  They have both strengths and weaknesses\
    \ that must\n         be considered when deploying them.  Furthermore, some protocols\n\
    \         have characteristics that are unnecessarily firewall-hostile;\n    \
    \     such practices should be avoided.\n      Workshop Report\n         This\
    \ document.\n"
- title: 8. Working Group Charters
  contents:
  - "8. Working Group Charters\n   The actual text in the working group charter is\
    \ likely to be\n   something fairly simple, like\n      Protocols developed by\
    \ this working group will be analyzed for\n      potential sources of security\
    \ breach. Identified threats will be\n      removed from the protocol if possible,\
    \ and documented and guarded\n      against in other cases.\n   The actual charter\
    \ text represents a policy enjoined and enforced by\n   the IESG, and may change\
    \ from time to time and from charter to\n   charter. However, it essentially references\
    \ and asks for text in\n   documents conforming to the following, which may be\
    \ very appropriate\n   to include in the RFC.\n"
- title: 9. Guidelines on writing Security Considerations in an RFC
  contents:
  - "9. Guidelines on writing Security Considerations in an RFC\n   A \"threat\" is,\
    \ by definition, a vulnerability available to a\n   motivated and capable adversary.\
    \ CERT advisories are quite\n   predictable given a knowledge of the target of\
    \ the threat; they\n   therefore represent an existence proof, but not a threat\
    \ analysis.\n   The point is to determine what attacks are possible (\"capabilities\"\
    \n   of a potential attacker) and formulate a defense against the attacks,\n \
    \  or convincingly argue that the attack is not realistic in some\n   environment\
    \ and restrict use of the protocol to that environment.\n   Recommended guidelines:\n\
    \      All RFCs - MUST meaningfully address security in the protocol or\n    \
    \  procedure it specifies. It MUST consider that it is giving its\n      data\
    \ to \"the enemy\" and asking it to be delivered to its friends\n      and used\
    \ in the manner it intended. Consideration MUST be given to\n      the ramifications\
    \ of the inherent danger of the situation.\n      - MUST do \"due diligence\"\
    \ to list the threats to which the\n      protocol is vulnerable. Use of legal\
    \ term does not imply legal\n      liability, but rather the level of responsibility\
    \ expected to be\n      applied to the analysis. This discussion might occur throughout\n\
    \      the document or in the Security Considerations section; if it\n      occurs\
    \ throughout, it MUST be summarized and referenced in the\n      Security Considerations\
    \ section.\n      - MUST discuss which of those threats are\n         * Ameliorated\
    \ by protocol mechanisms (example: SYN attack is\n         ameliorated by clever\
    \ code that drops sessions randomly when\n         under SYN attack)\n       \
    \  * Ameliorated by reliance on external mechanisms (example: TCP\n         data\
    \ confidentiality provided by IPSEC ESP)\n         * Irrelevant (\"In most cases,\
    \ MIBs are not themselves security\n         risks; If SNMP Security is operating\
    \ as intended, the use of a\n         MIB to change the configuration of a system\
    \ is a tool, not a\n         threat. For a threat analysis of SNMP Security, see\
    \ RFC ZZZZ.\")\n         * Not addressed by the protocol; results in applicability\n\
    \         statement.  (\"This protocol should not be used in an\n         environment\
    \ subject to this attack\")\n"
- title: 10. Core Security Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "10. Core Security Mechanisms\n   A variety of security mechanisms exist today.\
    \  Not all are well-\n   designed; not all are suitable for all purposes.  The\
    \ members of the\n   workshop designated a number of protocols as \"core\".  Such\
    \ protocols\n   should be used preferentially, if one of them has properties that\n\
    \   match the needs of your protocol.  The following were designated as\n   core:\n\
    \      IPsec [RFC 1825] is the basic host-to-host security mechanism.  It\n  \
    \       is appropriate for use any time address-based protection would\n     \
    \    have been used, including with such programs as rsh and rlogin.\n       \
    \  If and when platforms support user-based keying, this scope may\n         be\
    \ expanded.\n         One particular technique used by IPsec, HMAC [RFC 2104],\
    \ is\n         more generally useful.  If cryptographic authentication but not\n\
    \         secrecy is needed, and IPsec is not applicable, HMAC should be\n   \
    \      used.\n      ISAKMP/Oakley [ISAKMP drafts] is the basic key negotiation\n\
    \         protocol for IPsec.  As such, it should be deployed when IPsec\n   \
    \      is used.  With the appropriate \"domain of interpretation\"\n         document,\
    \ it should be used to negotiate pairwise keys for\n         other protocols.\n\
    \      DNSsec [RFC 2065] is not only crucial for protecting the DNS --\n     \
    \    cache contamination is the easiest way to launch active attacks\n       \
    \  -- it's also needed in many situations when IPsec is used.\n      Security/Multipart\
    \ [RFC 1847] is the preferred way to add secured\n         sections to MIME-encapsulated\
    \ email.\n      Signed keys in the DNS.  There is, as noted, widespread agreement\n\
    \         that DNS records themselves must be protected.  There was less\n   \
    \      agreement that the key records should be signed themselves,\n         making\
    \ them in effect certificates.  Still, this is one\n         promising avenue\
    \ for Internet certificates.\n      X.509v3 is the other obvious choice for a\
    \ certificate\n         infrastructure.  Again, though, there was no strong consensus\n\
    \         on this point.\n      TLS [TLS draft] was seen by some as the preferred\
    \ choice for\n         transport-layer security, though there was no consensus\
    \ on this\n         point.  TLS is less intrusive to the operating system than\n\
    \         IPsec; additionally, it is easier to provide fine-grained\n        \
    \ protection this way.\n   Some protocols were designated as \"useful but not\
    \ core\".  These were\n   insufficiently general, too new, or were substantially\
    \ duplicative of\n   core protocols.  These include AFT/SOCKS, RADIUS, firewalls,\
    \ GSS-API,\n   PGP, Kerberos, PGP-MIME, PKIX-3, the various forms of per-hop\n\
    \   authentication (OSPF, RSVP, RIPv2), *POP, OTP, S/MIME, SSH, PFKey,\n   IPsec\
    \ API, SASL, and CRAM/CHAP.  Obviously, entries on this list may\n   move in either\
    \ direction.\n   A few protocols were considered \"not useful\".  Primarily, these\
    \ are\n   ones that have failed to catch on, even though they've been available\n\
    \   for some time.  These include PEM [RFC 1421, 1422, 1423, 1424] and\n   MOSS\
    \ [RFC 1848].  (The phrase \"not useful\" does not imply that they\n   are incorrect,\
    \ or are lacking in important information.  However,\n   they do not describe\
    \ protocols that we are currently encouraging the\n   use of.)\n   One security\
    \ mechanism was deemed to be unacceptable:  plaintext\n   passwords.  That is,\
    \ no protocol that relies on passwords sent over\n   unencrypted channels is acceptable.\n"
- title: 11. Missing Pieces
  contents:
  - "11. Missing Pieces\n   Participants in the workshop identified three significant\
    \ missing\n   pieces: object security, secure email, and route security.\n   Object\
    \ security refers to protection for individual data objects,\n   independent of\
    \ transport.  We have one such already -- Secure DNS --\n   but we need a me general\
    \ scheme.  MIME is a candidate object\n   framework, in part because it is the\
    \ core of the two most widely used\n   and deployed applications: the web and\
    \ email.  However, securing\n   email has been problematic and the web is not\
    \ that far in front.\n   Secure email is a critical need and has been for some\
    \ time.  Two\n   attempts to standardize secure email protocols (PEM and MOSS)\
    \ have\n   failed to be accepted by the community, while a third protocol (PGP)\n\
    \   has become a de facto standard around the world.  A fourth protocol,\n   an\
    \ industry standard (S/MIME), has been gaining popularity.  Both of\n   these\
    \ latter of entered the Internet standards process.\n   Route security has recently\
    \ become a critical need.  The\n   sophistication of the attackers is on the rise\
    \ and the availability\n   of attacking toolkits has increased the number of sophisticated\n\
    \   attacks.  This task is especially complex because the requirement for\n  \
    \ maximum performance conflicts with the goal of adding security, which\n   usurps\
    \ resources that would otherwise enhance the performance of the\n   router.\n"
- title: 12. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "12. Security Considerations\n   Security is not and cannot be a cookie cutter\
    \ process.  There is no\n   magic pixie dust that can be sprinkled over a protocol\
    \ to make it\n   secure.  Each protocol must be analyzed individually to determine\n\
    \   what vulnerabilities exist, what risks they may lead to, what\n   palliative\
    \ measures can be taken, and what the residual risks are.\n"
