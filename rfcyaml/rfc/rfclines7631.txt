Abstract This document reorganizes the naming of already allocated TLV (type  length value) types and type extensions in the "Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) Parameters" registries defined by RFC 5444 to use names appropriately.
It has no consequences in terms of any protocol implementation.
This document also updates the Expert Review guidelines in RFC 5444, so as to establish a policy for consistent naming of future TLV type and type extension allocations.
It makes no other changes to RFC 5444.
This document reorganizes and rationalizes the naming of TLVs
(type  length value structures) defined by [RFC5444] and recorded by IANA in the following subregistries of the "Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) Parameters" registry: "Packet TLV Types", "Message TLV Types", and "Address Block TLV Types".
This document reorganizes the naming of already allocated Packet, Message, and Address Block TLV types, and their corresponding type extensions.
It also updates the corresponding IANA registries.
TLVs have a type (one octet) and a type extension (one octet) that together form a full type (of two octets).
A TLV may omit the type extension when it is zero.
However, that applies only to its representation; it still has a type extension of zero.
A TLV type defines an IANA registry of type extensions for that type.
There have been two forms of TLV allocation.
The first, but less common, form of allocation has been that allocation of the TLV type has defined (but not necessarily allocated)
all the type extensions for that TLV type.
This applies, for example, to the Address Block
TLV LINK METRIC specified in [RFC7181].
The LINK METRIC type extensions are all available for allocation for different definitions of link
It is appropriate in this case to apply the name LINK METRIC to the type, and also to all the full types corresponding to that type, as has been done.
Type extensions can then be individually named or can be simply referred to by their number.
The second, more common, form of allocation has been that allocation of the TLV type has defined only type extension 0, and possibly type extension 1, for that TLV type.
An example is the Address Block TLV LINK STATUS defined in [RFC6130], where only type extension 0 is allocated.
It is not reasonable to assume that the remaining 255 type extensions will be allocated to forms of LINK STATUS.
(Other forms of link status are already catered to by the introduction, in [RFC7188], of a registry for values of the LINK STATUS TLV.)
Thus, the name LINK STATUS should be attached to the specific type extension for that type, i.e., to the full type and not to the TLV type when used with any other type extensions.
This was, however, not done as part of the initial registration of this TLV type.
Effectively, this leaves, for the LINK STATUS TLV type, the type extensions 1 255 either unavailable for allocation (if applying strictly the interpretation that they must relate to a LINK STATUS) or counterintuitively named for their intended function.
The purpose of this document is to change how names of the second form are applied and recorded in IANA registries, and to provide guidelines and instructions for future TLV type allocations.
This is to facilitate the addition of new TLVs using type extensions other than 0, but without them having inappropriate names attached.
So, for example, LINK STATUS will become the name of the full type (composed of the TLV type 3 and the TLV type extension 0) and will cease being the name of the TLV type 3.
This leaves the question of how to name the type.
As it is not clear what other TLVs might be defined for other type extensions of the same type, the type is currently left unnamed and specified only by number.
This document also updates the Expert Review guidelines from [RFC5444], so as to establish a policy for consistent naming of future TLV type and type extension allocations.
For clarity, all currently allocated TLVs in [RFC5497], [RFC6130], [RFC6621], [RFC7181], and [RFC7182] are listed in the IANA Considerations section of this document, each specifying the updates or indicating no change when that is appropriate (such as the LINK METRIC TLV and both TLVs defined in [RFC6621]).
The only changes are of naming.
Note that nothing in this document changes the operation of any protocol.
This naming is already used, in effect, in [RFC6130] and [RFC7181], currently the main users of allocated TLVs.
For example, the former indicates that all usage of LINK STATUS refers to that TLV with type extension 0.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
All references to elements such as "packet", "message", and "TLV" in this document refer to those defined in [RFC5444].
This document updates the Expert Review evaluation guidelines for allocations in [RFC5444] in the "Packet TLV Types", "Message TLV Types", and "Address Block TLV Types" registries and updates the already made allocations to conform with these guidelines.
For registration in the "Packet TLV Types", "Message TLV Types", and "Address Block TLV Types" registries, the following guidelines apply, in addition to those given in Section 6.1 in [RFC5444]:
If the requested TLV type immediately defines (but not necessarily allocates)
all the corresponding type extensions for versions of that type, then a common name SHOULD be assigned for the TLV type.
This case is unchanged by this specification.
This currently includes TLV types named ICV, TIMESTAMP, and LINK METRIC; it also includes the HELLO Message Type specific TLVs defined in [RFC6621].
Otherwise, if the requested TLV type does not immediately define all the corresponding type extensions for versions of that type, then a common name SHOULD NOT be assigned for that TLV type.
For Packet TLV Types, the type extension registry, created for the TLV type, be named "Type XX Packet TLV Type Extensions", with XX replaced by the numerical value of the TLV type.
For Message TLV Types, the type extension registry, created for the TLV type, be named "Type XX Message TLV Type Extensions", with XX replaced by the numerical value of the TLV type.
For Address Block TLV Types, the type extension registry, created for the TLV type, be named "Type XX Address Block TLV Type Extensions", with XX replaced by the numerical value of the TLV type.
When a new type extension is required, unless there are reasons to the contrary, the next consecutive type extension is allocated and given a name.
(Reasons to the contrary MAY include maintaining a correspondence between corresponding Packet, Message, and Address Block TLVs, and reserving type extension zero
The following changes (including correction of some existing minor errors) apply to the IANA registry "Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) Parameters".

As this document is concerned only with how entities are named, those names being used only in documents such as this and IANA registries, this document has no security considerations.
