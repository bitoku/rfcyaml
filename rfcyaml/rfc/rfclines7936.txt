Abstract This document clarifies the instructions to IANA for the subprotocol registry set up for WebSockets in RFC 6455.
Introduction Section 11.5 of [RFC6455] sets up a WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry at IANA and directs IANA to use First Come
First Serve registration procedures as set out in [RFC5226].
The reuse of this registry by other protocols has indicated that some clarification of the instructions to IANA would be useful.
The tokens registered in the WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry created by Section 11.5 of RFC 6455 are matched using case sensitive string match.
IANA is, however, instructed to decline registrations in the registry which differ only as to case, in order to minimize potential confusion among different registered versions.
For other useful advice on avoiding collision, registrants are encouraged to consult the non normative Section 1.9 of RFC 6455.
This document describes an update to registry policy, not a protocol.
This document is, in its entirety, a clarification of the registry policy for the WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry.
As part of this clarification, IANA has listed both this document and RFC 6455 as references for the WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry.
In addition, IANA has included the following note under the registry's Registration Procedures: "Please see Section 2 of RFC 7936, which clarifies that registrations which differ from existing registrations only by case will be refused."
