  - "Abstract\n   This document revises the IANA guidelines for allocating new Protocol\n\
    \   field values in IPv4 header.  It modifies the rules specified in RFC\n   2780\
    \ by removing the Expert Review option.  The change will also\n   affect the allocation\
    \ of Next Header field values in IPv6.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document revises the IANA guidelines [RFC2780] for\
    \ allocating\n   new Protocol field values in IPv4 header [RFC0791].  The change\
    \ will\n   also be applicable for IPv6, as the IANA guidelines for IPv6 Next\n\
    \   Header values [RFC2460] allocation refer to the IPv4 guidelines.\n   Previously,\
    \ RFC 2780 allowed such allocations to happen through IESG\n   Approval, Standards\
    \ action, or Expert Review processes\n   [RFC2780][RFC2434].  The Expert Review\
    \ process was specified to be\n   used only in the case where a non-disclosure\
    \ agreement was involved:\n      IANA allocates values from the IPv4 Protocol\
    \ name space following\n      an Expert Review, IESG Approval or Standards Action\
    \ process.  The\n      Expert Review process should only be used in those special\
    \ cases\n      where non-disclosure information is involved.  In these cases the\n\
    \      expert(s) should be designated by the IESG.\n   The need for the Standards\
    \ Action rule is obvious as the IETF keeps\n   developing new protocols.  It is\
    \ equally obvious that there is a need\n   to allow experimental allocations in\
    \ this space; see RFC 4727\n   [RFC4727] for an example.  Similarly, there are\
    \ cases when it makes\n   sense to allocate values out of this space for other\
    \ non-Standards\n   Track or non-IETF uses.  However, the size of the field is\
    \ 256\n   values, and 55% of these were in use at the time this document was\n\
    \   written.  As a result, a sanity check is needed to ensure that\n   allocations\
    \ are not made needlessly.  RFC 2780 specifies the IESG\n   Approval rule to take\
    \ care of these sanity checks for the non-\n   Standards Track cases.  The judgment\
    \ call can take into account the\n   existence of a stable protocol specification,\
    \ constituency that wants\n   to use it, need to avoid duplicated allocations\
    \ for the same purpose,\n   whether protocol number allocation is the right solution\
    \ for this\n   problem as opposed to, say, a TCP port, and so on.\n   However,\
    \ we now believe that the non-disclosure agreement option is\n   not appropriate\
    \ for allocations in this space.  Traditionally, non-\n   disclosure agreements\
    \ have been used by the IANA when a company was\n   developing a proprietary protocol\
    \ and did not want to disclose new\n   areas of research or future products. \
    \ The protocol space is limited\n   enough that we no longer believe that it is\
    \ reasonable to use the\n   resource for such proprietary protocols.  Thus, we\
    \ believe that\n   allocations should only be made using the IESG Approval or\
    \ Standards\n   Action processes when there are public specifications that can\
    \ be\n   reviewed.\n   As a result, this document revises the RFC 2780 rules by\
    \ removing the\n   option for Expert Review for the IPv4 Protocol and IPv6 Next\
    \ Header\n   fields.  This document takes no position on the allocation of other\n\
    \   parameters with non-disclosure agreements, as those parameters may\n   require\
    \ different policies.\n"

  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   This document replaces the RFC 2780 Section 4.3 rule\
    \ [RFC2780] with\n   the following:\n      IANA allocates values from the IPv4\
    \ Protocol name space following\n      an IESG Approval or Standards Action process.\n\
    \   This document also makes an implicit change to the rule for the IPv6\n   Next\
    \ Header field in Section 5.3 of RFC 2780.  That rule refers to\n   the rule in\
    \ Section 4.3 of the same RFC.  From now on, this reference\n   should be understood\
    \ to refer to the rule revised here, i.e., without\n   the Expert Review option.\n"
