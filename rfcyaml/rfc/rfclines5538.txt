Abstract This memo specifies the 'news' and 'nntp' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes that were originally defined in RFC 1738.
The purpose of this document is to allow RFC 1738 to be made obsolete while keeping the information about these schemes on the Standards Track.
The first definition for many URI schemes appears in [RFC1738].
This memo extracts the 'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes from it to allow that material to remain on the Standards Track if [RFC1738] is moved to "historic" status.
It belongs to a series of similar documents like [RFC4156], [RFC4157], [RFC4248], and [RFC4266], which are discussed on the <mailto:uri@w3.org> list.
The definitions for the 'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes given here are updates from [RFC1738]
based on modern usage of these schemes.
This memo intentionally limits its description of the 'news' URI scheme to essential features supposed to work with "any browser" and Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) server.
[RFC3986] specifies how to define schemes for URIs; it also explains the term "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL).
The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is specified in [RFC3977].
The Netnews Article Format is defined in [RFC5536].
The key word "MUST" in this memo is to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
UTF 8 is specified in [RFC3629].
The syntax uses the ABNF defined in [RFC5234].
The 'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes identify resources on an NNTP server, individual articles, individual newsgroups, or sets of newsgroups.
User agents like Web browsers supporting these schemes use the NNTP protocol to access the corresponding resources.
The details of how they do this, e.g., employing a separate or integrated newsreader, depend on the implementation.
The default <port> associated with NNTP in [RFC3977] is 119.
The 'nntp' URI scheme identifies articles in a newsgroup on a specific NNTP server.
In [RFC3986] terminology, this means that 'nntp' URIs have a non empty <authority
> component; there is no default <host> as for the 'file' or 'news' URI schemes.
Netnews is typically distributed among several news servers, using the same newsgroup names but local article numbers.
An article available as number 10 in group "example" on server "news.example.com" has most likely a different number on any other server where the same article is still available.
Users allowed to read and post articles on "their" server may not be allowed to access articles on an "arbitrary" server specified in an 'nntp' URI.
For these reasons, the use of the 'nntp' URI scheme is limited, and it is less widely supported by user agents than the similar 'news' URI scheme.
The 'news' URI scheme identifies articles by their worldwide unique "Message ID", independent of the server and the newsgroup.
Newsreaders support access to articles by their "Message ID", without the overhead of a URI scheme.
In simple cases, they do this directly as an NNTP client of a default or currently used server as configured by the user.
More general user agents use the 'news' URI scheme to distinguish "Message IDs" from similar constructs such as other URI schemes in contexts such as a plain text message body.
The 'news' URI scheme also allows the identification of newsgroups or sets of newsgroups independent of a specific server.
For Netnews, a group "example" has the same name on any server carrying this group, exotic cases involving gateways notwithstanding.
In common practice, this was extended to varying degrees by different user agents.
An NNTP extension known as <wildmat>, specified in [RFC2980] and now part of the base NNTP specification, allows pattern matching in the style of the [POSIX] "find" command.
For the purpose of this memo, this means that some additional special characters have to be allowed in 'news' URIs, some of them percent encoded as required by the overall [RFC3986] URI syntax.
User agents and NNTP servers not yet compliant with [RFC3977] do not implement all parts of this new feature.
Another commonly supported addition to the [RFC1738] syntax is the optional specification of a server at the beginning of 'news' URIs.
URI producers have to percent encode some characters as specified below (Section 4); otherwise, they MUST treat a "Message ID" without angle brackets for 'news' URLs as is, i.e., case sensitive.
Syntax of 'nntp' URIs An 'nntp' URI identifies an article by its number in a given newsgroup on a specified server, or it identifies the newsgroup without article number.
" In the form with an <article number>, the URL corresponds roughly to the content of an <xref> header field as specified in [RFC5536], replacing its more general <article locator> by the <article number> used with the NNTP.
A <newsgroup name> as specified in [RFC5536] consists of dot  separated components.
These characters can be directly used in a segment of a path in an [RFC3986] URI; no percent encoding is necessary.
nntp://news.server.example/example.group.this/12345 A <wildmat exact> newsgroup name as specified in [RFC3977] allows (in theory)
However, [RFC5536] does not (yet) permit characters outside of <group char
and so, to keep the syntax simple
Example: nntp://wild.server.example/example.group.n%2Fa/12345 In the form without <article number>, the URL identifies a single group on the specified server.
This is also possible with an equivalent 'news' URL, and the latter is better supported by user agents.
Syntax of 'news' URIs A 'news' URI identifies an article by its unique "Message ID", or it identifies a set of newsgroups.
Additionally, it can specify a server; when the server is not specified, a configured default server for Netnews access is used.
The form identifying an <article> is the <msg
; it is a "Message ID" without angle brackets.
According to [RFC3986], characters that are in <gen delims
Specifically, the characters allowed in <msg
id right as defined in [RFC5322].
Examples (the first two are equivalent): news://news.server.example/  news://news.server.example/ news://wild.server.example/example.group.th%3Fse news:example.group.
news:example.group.this Without wildcards, this form of the URL identifies a single group if it is not empty.
User agents would typically try to present an overview of the articles available in this group, likely somehow limiting this overview to the newest unread articles up to a configured maximum.
With wildcards, user agents could try to list matching group names on the specified or default server.
The URI schemes were updated to support percent encoded UTF 8 characters in NNTP newsgroup names as specified in [RFC3977] and [RFC3987].
The Netnews Article Format in [RFC5536] does not yet allow UTF 8 in <newsgroup name>s; therefore, well known Unicode and UTF 8 security considerations are not listed below.
For an overview, see [UTR36] and [RFC3629].
The work on Email Address Internationalization (EAI), started in [RFC4952], is not expected to change the syntax of a "Message ID".
There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in [RFC3986].
The NNTP protocol may use passwords in the clear for authentication or offer no privacy, both of which are considered extremely unsafe in current practice.
Alternatives and further security considerations with respect to the NNTP are discussed in [RFC4642] and [RFC4643].
The syntax for the 'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes contains the general <authority> construct with an optional <userinfo
As noted in [RFC3986], the "user:password" form of a <userinfo> is deprecated.
Articles on NNTP servers typically expire after some time.
After that time, corresponding 'news' and 'nntp' URLs may not work anymore depending on the server.
While a "Message ID" is supposed to be worldwide unique forever, the NNTP protocol does not guarantee this.
Under various conditions depending on the servers, the same "Message ID" could be used for different articles, and attackers could try to distribute malicious content for known 'news' or 'nntp' URLs.
If a URI does not match the generic syntax in [RFC3986], it is invalid, and broken URIs can cause havoc.
Compare [RFC5064] for similar security considerations.
The IANA registry of URI schemes has been updated to point to this memo instead of [RFC1738] for the 'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes.
This section contains the [RFC4395] template for the registration of the historical 'snews' scheme specified in [GILMAN].
Same as for 'news' (Section 4) URI scheme semantics: Syntactically equivalent to 'news', but using NNTP over SSL/TLS (SSL/TLS with security layer is negotiated immediately after establishing the TCP connection) with a default port of 563, registered as "nntps" Encoding considerations:
Same as for 'news' (Section 6) Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:
For some user agents, 'snews' URLs trigger the use of "nntps" instead of NNTP for their access on Netnews Interoperability considerations
: This URI scheme was not widely deployed; its further use is deprecated in favor of ordinary 'news' URLs in conjunction with NNTP servers supporting [RFC4642]
The MIME 'news message ID' access type was erroneously listed as a subtype.
IANA has removed 'news message ID' from the application subtype registry, and has added it to the access types registry defined in [RFC4289].
[RFC4289] requires an RFC (preferably on the Standards Track) for the access types registry.
To provide a definition meeting this requirement, the following paragraph is reproduced verbatim from [RFC1849]:
In the specific case where it is desired to essentially make another article PART of the current one, e.g., for annotation of the other article, MIME's "message/external body" convention can be used to do so without actual inclusion.
"news message ID" was registered as a standard external body access method, with a mandatory NAME parameter giving the message ID and an optional SITE parameter suggesting an NNTP site that might have the article available (if it is not available locally), by IANA 22 June 1993.
Please note that 'news' URLs offer a very similar and (today) more common way to access articles by their Message ID; compare [RFC2017].
In addition to the syntax given above, this appendix also lists the sources of terms used in comments and the prose: nntpURL

Here is an example of a mail to the <mailto:tools.discuss@ietf.org
> list with "Message ID" <p0624081dc30b8699bf9b@[10.20.30.108]
is one of the various list archives; it converts mail into Netnews articles.
The header of this article contains the following fields (among others):
The "Xref" roughly indicates the 742nd article in newsgroup <news://news.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.tools> on this server.
An 'nntp' URL might be <nntp://news.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.tools/742
For details about the "Archived At" URL, see [RFC5064].
The list software and list subscribers reading the list elsewhere can't predict a server specific article number 742 in this archive.
If they know this server, they can however guess the corresponding <news://news.gmane.org/p0624081dc30b8699bf9b@%5B10.20.30.108%5D> URL.
In theory, the list software could use the guessed 'news' URL in an "Archived At" header field, but if a list tries this, it would likely use <http://mid.gmane.org/p0624081dc30b8699bf9b@%5B10.20.30.108%5D>.
Using domain literals in a "Message ID" could cause collisions.
A collision might force the mail2news gateway in this example to invent a new "Message ID", and an attempt to guess the future URL on this server would then fail.
