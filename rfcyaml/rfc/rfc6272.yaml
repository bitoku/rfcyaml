  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides Smart Grid designers with advice\
    \ on how to\n   best \"profile\" the Internet Protocol Suite (IPS) for use in\
    \ Smart\n   Grids.  It provides an overview of the IPS and the key infrastructure\n\
    \   protocols that are critical in integrating Smart Grid devices into an\n  \
    \ IP-based infrastructure.\n   In the words of Wikipedia [SmartGrid]:\n      A\
    \ Smart Grid is a form of electricity network utilizing digital\n      technology.\
    \  A Smart Grid delivers electricity from suppliers to\n      consumers using\
    \ two-way digital communications to control\n      appliances at consumers' homes;\
    \ this saves energy, reduces costs\n      and increases reliability and transparency.\
    \  It overlays the\n      ordinary electrical Grid with an information and net\
    \ metering\n      system, that includes smart meters.  Smart Grids are being\n\
    \      promoted by many governments as a way of addressing energy\n      independence,\
    \ global warming and emergency resilience issues.\n      A Smart Grid is made\
    \ possible by applying sensing, measurement and\n      control devices with two-way\
    \ communications to electricity\n      production, transmission, distribution\
    \ and consumption parts of\n      the power Grid that communicate information\
    \ about Grid condition\n      to system users, operators and automated devices,\
    \ making it\n      possible to dynamically respond to changes in Grid condition.\n\
    \      A Smart Grid includes an intelligent monitoring system that keeps\n   \
    \   track of all electricity flowing in the system.  It also has the\n      capability\
    \ of integrating renewable electricity such as solar and\n      wind.  When power\
    \ is least expensive the user can allow the smart\n      Grid to turn on selected\
    \ home appliances such as washing machines\n      or factory processes that can\
    \ run at arbitrary hours.  At peak\n      times it could turn off selected appliances\
    \ to reduce demand.\n      Other names for a Smart Grid (or for similar proposals)\
    \ include\n      smart electric or power Grid, intelligent Grid (or intelliGrid),\n\
    \      futureGrid, and the more modern interGrid and intraGrid.\n   That description\
    \ focuses on the implications of Smart Grid technology\n   in the home of a consumer.\
    \  In fact, data communications technologies\n   of various kinds are used throughout\
    \ the Grid, to monitor and\n   maintain power generation, transmission, and distribution,\
    \ as well as\n   the operations and management of the Grid.  One can view the\
    \ Smart\n   Grid as a collection of interconnected computer networks that\n  \
    \ connects and serves the needs of public and private electrical\n   utilities\
    \ and their customers.\n   At the time of this writing, there is no single document\
    \ that can be\n   described as comprising an internationally agreed standard for\
    \ the\n   Smart Grid; that is in part the issue being addressed in its\n   development.\
    \  The nearest approximations are probably the Smart Grid\n   Interoperability\
    \ Panel's Conceptual Model [Model] and documents\n   comprising [IEC61850].\n\
    \   The Internet Protocol Suite (IPS) provides options for numerous\n   architectural\
    \ components.  For example, the IPS provides several\n   choices for the traditional\
    \ transport function between two systems:\n   the Transmission Control Protocol\
    \ (TCP) [RFC0793], the Stream Control\n   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960],\
    \ and the Datagram Congestion\n   Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4340].  Another\
    \ option is to select an\n   encapsulation such as the User Datagram Protocol\
    \ (UDP) [RFC0768],\n   which essentially allows an application to implement its\
    \ own\n   transport service.  In practice, a designer will pick a transport\n\
    \   protocol that is appropriate to the problem being solved.\n   The IPS is standardized\
    \ by the Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF).  IETF protocols are documented\
    \ in the Request for Comments\n   (RFC) series.  Several RFCs have been written\
    \ describing how the IPS\n   should be implemented.  These include:\n   o  Requirements\
    \ for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers [RFC1122],\n   o  Requirements for\
    \ Internet Hosts - Application and Support\n      [RFC1123],\n   o  Requirements\
    \ for IP Version 4 Routers [RFC1812], and\n   o  IPv6 Node Requirements [RFC4294].\n\
    \   At the time of this writing, RFC 4294 is in the process of being\n   updated,\
    \ in [IPv6-NODE-REQ].\n   This document is intended to provide Smart Grid architects\
    \ and\n   designers with a compendium of relevant RFCs (and to some extent,\n\
    \   Internet Drafts), and is organized as an annotated list of RFCs.  To\n   that\
    \ end, the remainder of this document is organized as follows:\n   o  Section\
    \ 2 describes the Internet Architecture and its protocol\n      suite.\n   o \
    \ Section 3 outlines a set of protocols that may be useful in Smart\n      Grid\
    \ deployment.  It is not exhaustive.\n   o  Finally, Section 4 provides an overview\
    \ of the business\n      architecture embodied in the design and deployment of\
    \ the IPS.\n"

  - "2.1.  Internet Protocol Layers\n   While Internet architecture uses the definitions\
    \ and language similar\n   to language used by the ISO Open System Interconnect\
    \ (ISO-OSI)\n   reference model (Figure 1), it actually predates that model. \
    \ As a\n   result, there is some skew in terminology.  For example, the ISO-OSI\n\
    \   model uses \"end system\" while the Internet architecture uses \"host\".\n\
    \   Similarly, an \"intermediate system\" in the ISO-OSI model is called an\n\
    \   \"internet gateway\" or \"router\" in Internet parlance.  Notwithstanding\n\
    \   these differences, the fundamental concepts are largely the same.\n      \

  - "2.1.1.  Application\n   In the Internet model, the Application, Presentation,\
    \ and Session\n   layers are compressed into a single entity called \"the application\"\
    .\n   For example, the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3411]\n \
    \  describes an application that encodes its data in an ASN.1 profile\n   and\
    \ engages in a session to manage a network element.  The point here\n   is that\
    \ in the Internet, the distinction between these layers exists\n   but is not\
    \ highlighted.  Further, note that in Figure 2, these\n   functions are not necessarily\
    \ cleanly layered: the fact that an\n   application protocol encodes its data\

  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Transport\n   The term \"transport\" is perhaps among the most confusing\
    \ concepts in\n   the communication architecture, to a large extent because people\
    \ with\n   various backgrounds use it to refer to \"the layer below that which\
    \ I\n   am interested in, which gets my data to my peer\".  For example,\n   optical\
    \ network engineers refer to optical fiber and associated\n   electronics as \"\
    the transport\", while web designers refer to the\n   Hypertext Transfer Protocol\
    \ (HTTP) [RFC2616] (an application layer\n   protocol) as \"the transport\".\n\
    \   In the Internet protocol stack, the \"transport\" is the lowest\n   protocol\
    \ layer that travels end-to-end unmodified, and it is\n   responsible for end-to-end\
    \ data delivery services.  In the Internet,\n   the transport layer is the layer\
    \ above the network layer.  Transport\n   layer protocols have a single minimum\
    \ requirement: the ability to\n   multiplex several applications on one IP address.\
    \  UDP [RFC0768], TCP\n   [RFC0793], DCCP [RFC4340], SCTP [RFC4960], and NORM\
    \ [RFC5740] each\n   accomplish this using a pair of port numbers, one for the\
    \ sender and\n   one for the receiver.  A port number identifies an application\n\
    \   instance, which might be a general \"listener\" that peers or clients\n  \
    \ may open sessions with, or a specific correspondent with such a\n   \"listener\"\
    .  The session identification in an IP datagram is often\n   called the \"five-tuple\"\
    , and consists of the source and destination\n   IP addresses, the source and\
    \ destination ports, and an identifier for\n   the transport protocol in use.\n\
    \   In addition, the responsibilities of a specific transport layer\n   protocol\
    \ typically include the delivery of data (either as a stream\n   of messages or\
    \ a stream of bytes) in a stated sequence with stated\n   expectations regarding\
    \ delivery rate and loss.  For example, TCP will\n   reduce its rate in response\
    \ to loss, as a congestion control trigger,\n   while DCCP accepts some level\
    \ of loss if necessary to maintain\n   timeliness.\n"

    \ is popular, it\n   is important to distinguish between attacks on protocols\
    \ and attacks\n   on users (e.g., phishing).  Attacks on users are largely independent\n\
    \   of protocol details, reflecting interface design issues or user\n   education\
    \ problems, and are out of scope for this document.  Security\n   problems with\
    \ Internet protocols are in scope, of course, and can\n   often be mitigated using\
    \ existing security features already specified\n   for the protocol, or by leveraging\
    \ the security services offered by\n   other IETF protocols.  See the Security\
    \ Assessment of the\n   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [TCP-SEC] and the\
    \ Security\n   Assessment of the Internet Protocol version 4 [IP-SEC] for more\n\
    \   information on TCP and IPv4 issues, respectively.\n   These solutions do,\
    \ however, need to get deployed as well.  The road\n   to widespread deployment\
    \ can sometimes be painful since often\n   multiple stakeholders need to take\
    \ actions.  Experience has shown\n   that this takes some time, and very often\
    \ only happens when the\n   incentives are high enough in relation to the costs.\n\
    \   Furthermore, it is important to stress that available standards are\n   important,\
    \ but the range of security problems is larger than a\n   missing standard; many\
    \ security problems are the result of\n   implementation bugs and the result of\
    \ certain deployment choices.\n   While these are outside the realm of standards\
    \ development, they play\n   an important role in the security of the overall\
    \ system.  Security\n   has to be integrated into the entire process.\n   The\
    \ IETF takes security seriously in the design of their protocols\n   and architectures;\
    \ every IETF specification has to have a Security\n   Considerations section to\
    \ document the offered security threats and\n   countermeasures.  RFC 3552 [RFC3552]\
    \ provides recommendations on\n   writing such a Security Considerations section.\

    \ into every protocol,\n   protocol extension, and consequently, every layer of\
    \ the protocol\n   stack to be useful.  We illustrate this also throughout this\
    \ document\n   with references to further security discussions.  Our experience\

- title: 2.2.2.  Network, Transport, and Application Layer Security
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Network, Transport, and Application Layer Security\n   At the network,\
    \ transport, and application layers, it is common to\n   demand a few basic security\
    \ requirements, commonly referred to as CIA\n   (Confidentiality, Integrity, and\
    \ Availability):\n   1.  Confidentiality: Protect the transmitted data from unauthorized\n\
    \       disclosure (i.e., keep eavesdroppers from learning what was\n       transmitted).\
    \  For example, for trust in e-commerce applications,\n       credit card transactions\
    \ are exchanged encrypted between the Web\n       browser and a Web server.\n\
    \   2.  Integrity: Protect against unauthorized changes to exchanges,\n      \
    \ including both intentional change or destruction and accidental\n       change\
    \ or loss, by ensuring that changes to exchanges are\n       detectable.  It has\
    \ two parts: one for the data and one for the\n       peers.\n       *  Peers\
    \ need to verify that information that appears to be from\n          a trusted\
    \ peer is really from that peer.  This is typically\n          called 'data origin\
    \ authentication'.\n       *  Peers need to validate that the content of the data\
    \ exchanged\n          is unmodified.  The term typically used for this property\
    \ is\n          'data integrity'.\n   3.  Availability: Ensure that the resource\
    \ is accessible by\n       mitigating of denial-of-service attacks.\n   To this\
    \ we add authenticity, which requires that the communicating\n   peers prove that\
    \ they are in fact who they say they are to each other\n   (i.e., mutual authentication).\
    \  This generally means knowing \"who\"\n   the peer is, and that they demonstrate\
    \ the possession of a \"secret\"\n   as part of the security protocol interaction.\n\
    \   The following three examples aim to illustrate these security\n   requirements.\n\
    \   One common attack against a TCP session is to bombard the session\n   with\
    \ reset messages.  Other attacks against TCP include the \"SYN\n   flooding\"\
    \ attack, in which an attacker attempts to exhaust the memory\n   of the target\
    \ by creating TCP state.  In particular, the attacker\n   attempts to exhaust\
    \ the target's memory by opening a large number of\n   unique TCP connections,\
    \ each of which is represented by a\n   Transmission Control Block (TCB).  The\
    \ attack is successful if the\n   attacker can cause the target to fill its memory\
    \ with TCBs.\n   A number of mechanisms have been developed to deal with these\
    \ types\n   of denial-of-service attacks.  One, \"SYN Cookies\", delays state\n\
    \   establishment on the server side to a later phase in the protocol\n   exchange.\
    \  Another mechanism, specifically targeting the reset attack\n   cited above,\
    \ provides authentication services in TCP itself to ensure\n   that fake resets\
    \ are rejected.\n   Another approach would be to offer security protection already\
    \ at a\n   lower layer, such as IPsec (see Section 3.1.2) or TLS (see\n   Section\
    \ 3.1.3), so that a host can identify legitimate messages and\n   discard the\
    \ others, thus mitigating any damage that may have been\n   caused by the attack.\n\
    \   Another common attack involves unauthorized access to resources.  For\n  \
    \ example, an unauthorized party might try to attach to a network.  To\n   protect\
    \ against such an attack, an Internet Service Provider (ISP)\n   typically requires\
    \ network access authentication of new hosts\n   demanding access to the network\
    \ and to the Internet prior to offering\n   access.  This exchange typically requires\
    \ authentication of that\n   entity and a check in the ISPs back-end database\
    \ to determine whether\n   corresponding subscriber records exist and are still\
    \ valid (e.g.,\n   active subscription and sufficient credits).\n   From the discussion\
    \ above, establishing a secure communication\n   channel is clearly an important\
    \ concept frequently used to mitigate a\n   range of attacks.  Unfortunately,\
    \ focusing only on channel security\n   may not be enough for a given task.  Threat\
    \ models have evolved and\n   even some of the communication endpoints cannot\
    \ be considered fully\n   trustworthy, i.e., even trusted peers may act maliciously.\n\
    \   Furthermore, many protocols are more sophisticated in their protocol\n   interaction\
    \ and involve more than two parties in the protocol\n   exchange.  Many of the\
    \ application layer protocols, such as email,\n   instant messaging, voice over\
    \ IP, and presence-based applications,\n   fall into this category.  With this\
    \ class of protocols, secure data,\n   such as DNS records, and secure communications\
    \ with middleware,\n   intermediate servers, and supporting applications need\
    \ to be\n   considered as well as the security of the direct communication.  A\n\
    \   detailed treatment of the security threats and requirements of these\n   multi-party\
    \ protocols is beyond this specification but the interested\n   reader is referred\
    \ to the above-mentioned examples for an\n   illustration of what technical mechanisms\
    \ have been investigated and\n   proposed in the past.\n"

    \ for network\n   access consists of the following building blocks: the Extensible\n\
    \   Authentication Protocol (EAP [RFC4017]) as a container to encapsulate\n  \
    \ EAP methods, an EAP Method (as a specific way to perform\n   cryptographic authentication\

    \ independent security\n   mechanisms described in the previous sub-sections are\
    \ not sufficient\n   to deal with all the identified threats.  For this purpose,\
    \ a number\n   of security primitives are additionally available at the application\n\
    \   layer where the semantic of the application can be considered.\n   We will\
    \ focus our description on a few mechanisms that are commonly\n   used throughout\
    \ the Internet.\n   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS [RFC5652]) is an encapsulation\n\
    \   syntax to sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt arbitrary message\n   content.\
    \  It also allows arbitrary attributes, such as signing time,\n   to be signed\
    \ along with the message content, and it provides for\n   other attributes such\
    \ as countersignatures to be associated with a\n   signature.  The CMS can support\
    \ a variety of architectures for\n   certificate-based key management, such as\
    \ the one defined by the PKIX\n   (Public Key Infrastructure using X.509) working\
    \ group [RFC5280].  The\n   CMS has been leveraged to supply security services\
    \ in a variety of\n   protocols, including secure email [RFC5751], key management\
    \ [RFC5958]\n   [RFC6031], and firmware updates [RFC4108].\n   Related work includes\
    \ the use of digital signatures on XML-encoded\n   documents, which has been jointly\
    \ standardized by W3C and the IETF\n   [RFC3275].  Digitally signed XML is a good\
    \ choice where applications\n   natively support XML-encoded data, such as the\
    \ Extensible Messaging\n   and Presence Protocol (XMPP).\n   More recently, the\
    \ work on delegated authentication and authorization\n   often demanded by Web\
    \ applications have been developed with the Open\n   Web Authentication (OAuth)\
    \ protocol [RFC5849] [OAUTHv2].  OAuth is\n   used by third-party applications\
    \ to gain access to protected\n   resources (such as energy consumption information\
    \ about a specific\n   household) without having the resource owner share its\
    \ long-term\n   credentials with that third-party.  In OAuth, the third-party\n\
    \   application requests access to resources controlled by the resource\n   owner\
    \ and hosted by the resource server, and is issued a different\n   set of credentials\
    \ than those of the resource owner.  More\n   specifically, the third-party applications\
    \ obtain an access token\n   during the OAuth protocol exchange.  This token denotes\
    \ a specific\n   scope, duration, and other access attributes.  As a result, it\n\
    \   securely gains access to the protected resource with the consent of\n   the\
    \ resource owner.\n"

    \   delay approval of protocols.  There are two generic key management\n   schemes\

    \   (a locally trusted copy of a CA public key) down to the public key of\n  \
    \ some protocol peer, PKI allows for secure binding between keys and\n   protocol-specific\
    \ names, such as email addresses, and hence enables\n   security services such\
    \ as data and peer authentication, data\n   integrity, and confidentiality (encryption).\n\
    \   The main Internet standard for PKI is [RFC5280], which is a profile\n   of\

    \ commercial CAs operating today providing the ability to\n   manage and securely\
    \ distribute keys for all protocols that use public\n   key certificates, e.g.,\
    \ TLS and S/MIME.  In addition to the profile\n   standard, the PKIX working group\

  contents:
  - "3.2.1.3.  Translation between IPv4 and IPv6 Networks\n   In those cases where\
    \ an IPv4-only host would like to communicate with\n   an IPv6-only host (or vice\
    \ versa), a need for protocol translation\n   may be indicated.  At first blush,\
    \ protocol translation may appear\n   trivial; on deeper inspection, it turns\
    \ out that protocol translation\n   can be complicated.\n   The most reliable\
    \ approach to protocol translation is to provide\n   application layer proxies\
    \ or gateways, which natively enable\n   application-to-application connections\
    \ using both protocols and can\n   use whichever is appropriate.  For example,\
    \ a web proxy might use\n   both protocols and as a result enable an IPv4-only\
    \ system to run HTTP\n   across an IPv6-only network or to a web server that implements\
    \ only\n   IPv6.  Since this approach is a service of a protocol-agnostic\n  \
    \ server, it is not the subject of standardization by the IETF.\n   For those\
    \ applications in which network layer translation is\n   indicated, the IETF has\
    \ designed a translation mechanism, which is\n   described in the following documents:\n\
    \   o  Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation [RFC6144]\n   o  IPv6 Addressing of\
    \ IPv4/IPv6 Translators [RFC6052]\n   o  DNS extensions [RFC6147]\n   o  IP/ICMP\
    \ Translation Algorithm [RFC6145]\n   o  Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4\
    \ Servers [RFC6146]\n   As with IPv4/IPv4 Network Address Translation, translation\
    \ between\n   IPv4 and IPv6 has limited real world applicability for an application\n\
    \   protocol that carries IP addresses in its payload and expects those\n   addresses\
    \ to be meaningful to both client and server.  However, for\n   those protocols\
    \ that do not, protocol translation can provide a\n   useful network extension.\n\
    \   Network-based translation provides for two types of services:\n   stateless\
    \ (and therefore scalable and load-sharable) translation\n   between IPv4 and\
    \ IPv6 addresses that embed an IPv4 address in them,\n   and stateful translation\
    \ similar to IPv4/IPv4 translation between\n   IPv4 addresses.  The stateless\
    \ mode is straightforward to implement,\n   but due to the embedding, requires\
    \ IPv4 addresses to be allocated to\n   an otherwise IPv6-only network, and is\
    \ primarily useful for IPv4-\n   accessible servers implemented in the IPv6 network.\
    \  The stateful\n   mode allows clients in the IPv6 network to access servers\
    \ in the IPv4\n   network, but does not provide such service for IPv4 clients\
    \ accessing\n   IPv6 peers or servers with general addresses; it has the advantage\n\
    \   that it does not require that a unique IPv4 address be embedded in\n   the\
    \ IPv6 address of hosts using this mechanism.\n   Finally, note that some site\
    \ networks are IPv6 only while some\n   transit networks are IPv4 only.  In these\
    \ cases, it may be necessary\n   to tunnel IPv6 over IPv4 or translate between\
    \ IPv6 and IPv4.\n"

    \ plane for\n   building distribution trees, and a forwarding plane that uses\
    \ the\n   distribution tree when forwarding multicast traffic.\n   The multicast\
    \ model works as follows: hosts express their interest in\n   receiving multicast\
    \ traffic from a source by sending a Join message\n   to their first-hop router.\
    \  That router in turn sends a Join message\n   upstream towards the root of the\
    \ tree, grafting the router (leaf\n   node) onto the distribution tree for the\
    \ group.  Data is delivered\n   down the tree toward the leaf nodes, which forward\
    \ it onto the local\n   network for delivery.\n   The initial multicast model\
    \ deployed in the Internet was known as\n   Any-Source Multicast (ASM).  In the\
    \ ASM model, any host could send to\n   the group and inter-domain multicast was\

    \ (S) and a group (G).\n   Distribution trees are rooted to the sending host (called\
    \ an \"(S,G)\n   tree\").  Since only the source S can send on to the group, SSM\
    \ has\n   inherent anti-jamming capability.  In addition, inter-domain\n   multicast\
    \ is simplified since finding the (S,G) channel they are\n   interested in receiving\

    \ UDP, SCTP, or TLS over TCP.  SIP is independent of the\n   transport layer,\
    \ and independent of the underlying IPv4/v6 version.\n   In fact, the transport\
    \ protocol used can change as the SIP message\n   traverses SIP entities from\
    \ source to destination.\n   SIP itself does not choose whether a session is voice\

    \ Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is intended for those purposes.\n\
    \   Within the SDP, which is transported by SIP, codecs are offered and\n   accepted\

    \ Markup Language (XML) elements in\n   order to exchange structured information\
    \ in close to real time\n   between any two network endpoints.  Since XMPP provides\
    \ a\n   generalized, extensible framework for exchanging XML data, it has\n  \
    \ been proposed as an application structure for interchange between\n   embedded\

  - "4.  A Simplified View of the Business Architecture\n   The Internet is a network\
    \ of networks in which networks are\n   interconnected in specific ways and are\
    \ independently operated.  It\n   is important to note that the underlying Internet\
    \ architecture puts\n   no restrictions on the ways that networks are interconnected;\n\
    \   interconnection is a business decision.  As such, the Internet\n   interconnection\
    \ architecture can be thought of as a \"business\n   structure\" for the Internet.\n\
    \   Central to the Internet business structure are the networks that\n   provide\
    \ connectivity to other networks, called \"transit networks\".\n   These networks\
    \ sell bulk bandwidth and routing services to each other\n   and to other networks\
    \ as customers.  Around the periphery of the\n   transit network are companies,\
    \ schools, and other networks that\n   provide services directly to individuals.\
    \  These might generally be\n   divided into \"enterprise networks\" and \"access\
    \ networks\"; enterprise\n   networks provide \"free\" connectivity to their own\
    \ employees or\n   members, and also provide them a set of services including\
    \ electronic\n   mail, web services, and so on.  Access networks sell broadband\n\
    \   connectivity (DSL, Cable Modem, 802.11 wireless, or 3GPP wireless) or\n  \
    \ \"dial\" services (including PSTN dial-up and ISDN) to subscribers.\n   The\
    \ subscribers are typically either residential or small office/home\n   office\
    \ (SOHO) customers.  Residential customers are generally\n   entirely dependent\
    \ on their access provider for all services, while a\n   SOHO buys some services\
    \ from the access provider and may provide\n   others for itself.  Networks that\
    \ sell transit services to nobody\n   else -- SOHO, residential, and enterprise\
    \ networks -- are generally\n   refereed to as \"edge networks\"; transit networks\
    \ are considered to be\n   part of the \"core\" of the Internet, and access networks\
    \ are between\n   the two.  This general structure is depicted in Figure 3.\n\

    \ across VPN\n   Note that in both cases, the home network uses private address\
    \ space\n   [RFC1918] while other networks generally use public address space,\n\
    \   and that three middleware technologies are in use here.  These are\n   the\
    \ uses of a firewall, a Network Address Translator (NAT), and a\n   Virtual Private\
    \ Network (VPN).\n   Firewalls are generally sold as and considered by many to\
    \ be a\n   security technology.  This is based on the fact that a firewall\n \
    \  imposes a border between two administrative domains.  Typically, a\n   firewall\
    \ will be deployed between a residential, SOHO, or enterprise\n   network and\
    \ its access or transit provider.  In its essence, a\n   firewall is a data diode,\
    \ imposing a policy on what sessions may pass\n   between a protected domain and\
    \ the rest of the Internet.  Simple\n   policies generally permit sessions to\
    \ be originated from the\n   protected network but not from the outside; more\
    \ complex policies may\n   permit additional sessions from the outside, such as\
    \ electronic mail\n   to a mail server or a web session to a web server, and may\
    \ prevent\n   certain applications from global access even though they are\n \
    \  originated from the inside.\n   Note that the effectiveness of firewalls remains\
    \ controversial.\n   While network managers often insist on deploying firewalls\
    \ as they\n   impose a boundary, others point out that their value as a security\n\
    \   solution is debatable.  This is because most attacks come from behind\n  \
    \ the firewall.  In addition, firewalls do not protect against\n   application\
    \ layer attacks such as viruses carried in email.  Thus, as\n   a security solution,\
    \ firewalls are justified as a layer in defense in\n   depth.  That is, while\
    \ an end system must in the end be responsible\n   for its own security, a firewall\
    \ can inhibit or prevent certain kinds\n   of attacks, for example the consumption\
    \ of CPU time on a critical\n   server.\n   Key documents describing firewall\
    \ technology and the issues it poses\n   include:\n   o  IP Multicast and Firewalls\
    \ [RFC2588]\n   o  Benchmarking Terminology for Firewall Performance [RFC2647]\n\
    \   o  Behavior of and Requirements for Internet Firewalls [RFC2979]\n   o  Benchmarking\

    \ Problem Statement [RFC4487]\n   o  NAT and Firewall Traversal Issues of Host\
    \ Identity Protocol\n      Communication [RFC5207]\n   Network Address Translation\
    \ is a technology that was developed in\n   response to ISP behaviors in the mid-1990's;\
    \ when [RFC1918] was\n   published, many ISPs started handing out single or small\
    \ numbers of\n   addresses, and edge networks were forced to translate.  In time,\
    \ this\n   became considered a good thing, or at least not a bad thing; it\n \
    \  amplified the public address space, and it was sold as if it were a\n   firewall.\
    \  It of course is not; while traditional dynamic NATs only\n   translate between\
    \ internal and external session address/port tuples\n   during the detected duration\
    \ of the session, that session state may\n   exist in the network much longer\
    \ than it exists on the end system,\n   and as a result constitutes an attack\
    \ vector.  The design, value, and\n   limitations of network address translation\
    \ are described in:\n   o  IP Network Address Translator Terminology and Considerations\n\

    \ it is in fact across a service provider's\n   network.  Examples include IPsec\

    \ the home itself and\n   its Home Area Network (HAN), the Neighborhood Area Network\
    \ (NAN) that\n   the utility uses to access the meter at the home, and the utility\n\
    \   access network that connects a set of NANs to the utility itself.\n   For\
    \ the purposes of this discussion, assume that the NAN contains a\n   distributed\
    \ application in a set collectors, which is of course only\n   one way the application\

    \ are several questions that have to be answered in describing\n   this picture,\
    \ which given possible answers yield different possible\n   models.  They include\
    \ at least:\n   o  How does Demand Response work?  Either:\n      *  The utility\
    \ presents pricing signals to the home,\n      *  The utility presents pricing\
    \ signals to individual devices\n         (e.g., a Pluggable Electric Vehicle),\n\
    \      *  The utility adjusts settings on individual appliances within\n     \
    \    the home.\n   o  How does the utility access meters at the home?\n      *\
    \  The AMI Headend manages the interfaces with the meters,\n         collecting\
    \ metering data and passing it on to the appropriate\n         applications over\
    \ the Enterprise Bus, or\n      *  Distributed application support (\"collectors\"\
    ) might access and\n         summarize the information; this device might be managed\
    \ by the\n         utility or by a service between the utility and its customers.\n\
    \   In implementation, these models are idealized; reality may include\n   some\
    \ aspects of each model in specified cases.\n   The examples include:\n   1. \
    \ Appendix A.2 presumes that the HAN, the NAN, and the utility's\n       network\
    \ are separate administrative domains and speak application\n       to application\
    \ across those domains.\n   2.  Appendix A.3 repeats the first example, but presuming\
    \ that the\n       utility directly accesses appliances within the HAN from the\n\
    \       collector.\n   3.  Appendix A.4 repeats the first example, but presuming\
    \ that the\n       collector directly forwards traffic as a router in addition\
    \ to\n       distributed application chores.  Note that this case implies\n  \
    \     numerous privacy and security concerns and as such is considered\n     \
    \  a less likely deployment model.\n"
- title: A.1.  How to Structure a Network
  contents:
  - "A.1.  How to Structure a Network\n   A key consideration in the Internet has\
    \ been the development of new\n   link layer technologies over time.  The ARPANET\
    \ originally used a BBN\n   proprietary link layer called BBN 1822 [r1822].  In\
    \ the late 1970's,\n   the ARPANET switched to X.25 as an interface to the 1822\
    \ network.\n   With the deployment of the IEEE 802 series technologies in the\
    \ early\n   1980's, IP was deployed on Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Token Ring (IEEE\n\
    \   802.5) and WiFi (IEEE 802.11), as well as Arcnet, serial lines of\n   various\
    \ kinds, Frame Relay, and ATM.  A key issue in this evolution\n   was that the\
    \ applications developed to run on the Internet use APIs\n   related to the IPS,\
    \ and as a result require little or no change to\n   continue operating in a new\
    \ link layer architecture or a mixture of\n   them.\n   The Smart Grid is likely\
    \ to see a similar evolution over time.\n   Consider the Home Area Network (HAN)\
    \ as a readily understandable\n   small network.  At this juncture, technologies\
    \ proposed for\n   residential networks include IEEE P1901, various versions of\
    \ IEEE\n   802.15.4, and IEEE 802.11.  It is reasonable to expect other\n   technologies\
    \ to be developed in the future.  As the Zigbee Alliance\n   has learned (and\
    \ as a resulted incorporated the IPS in Smart Energy\n   Profile 2.0), there is\
    \ significant value in providing a virtual\n   address that is mapped to interfaces\
    \ or nodes attached to each of\n   those technologies.\n                   Utility\

    \        Figure 7: Two Views of a Home Area Network\n   There are two possible\
    \ communication models within the HAN, both of\n   which are likely to be useful.\
    \  Devices may communicate directly with\n   each other, or they may be managed\
    \ by some central controller.  An\n   example of direct communications might be\
    \ a light switch that\n   directly commands a lamp to turn on or off.  An example\
    \ of indirect\n   communications might be a control application in a Customer\
    \ or\n   Building that accepts telemetry from a thermostat, applies some form\n\
    \   of policy, and controls the heating and air conditioning systems.  In\n  \
    \ addition, there are high-end appliances in the market today that use\n   residential\
    \ broadband to communicate with their manufacturers, and\n   obviously the meter\
    \ needs to communicate with the utility.\n   Figure 7 shows two simple networks,\
    \ one of which uses IEEE 802.15.4\n   and IEEE 1901 domains, and one of which\
    \ uses an arbitrary LAN within\n   the home, which could be IEEE 802.3/Ethernet,\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE\n   1901, IEEE 802.11, or anything else that made sense\
    \ in context.  Both\n   show the connectivity between them as a router separate\
    \ from the\n   energy management system (EMS).  This is for clarity; the two could\n\
    \   of course be incorporated into a single system, and one could imagine\n  \
    \ appliances that want to communicate with their manufacturers\n   supporting\
    \ both a HAN interface and a WiFi interface rather than\n   depending on the router.\
    \  These are all manufacturer design\n   decisions.\n"
- title: A.1.1.  HAN Routing
  contents:
  - "A.1.1.  HAN Routing\n   The HAN can be seen as communicating with two kinds of\
    \ non-HAN\n   networks.  One is the home LAN, which may in turn be attached to\
    \ the\n   Internet, and will generally either derive its prefix from the\n   upstream\
    \ ISP or use a self-generated Unique Local Addressing (ULA).\n   Another is the\
    \ utility's NAN, which through an ESI provides utility\n   connectivity to the\
    \ HAN; in this case the HAN will be addressed by a\n   self-generated ULA (note,\
    \ however, that in some cases ESI may also\n   provide a prefix via DHCP [RFC3315]).\
    \  In addition, the HAN will have\n   link-local addresses that can be used between\
    \ neighboring nodes.  In\n   general, an HAN will be comprised of both 802.15.4,\
    \ 802.11, and\n   possibly other networks.\n   The ESI is a node on the user's\
    \ residential network, and will not\n   typically provide stateful packet forwarding\
    \ or firewall services\n   between the HAN and the utility network(s).  In general,\
    \ the ESI is a\n   node on the home network; in some cases, the meter may act\
    \ as the\n   ESI.  However, the ESI must be capable of understanding that most\n\
    \   home networks are not 802.15.4 enabled (rather, they are typically\n   802.11\
    \ networks), and that it must be capable of setting up ad hoc\n   networks between\
    \ various sensors in the home (e.g., between the meter\n   and say, a thermostat)\
    \ in the event there aren't other networks\n   available.\n"
- title: A.1.2.  HAN Security
  contents:
  - "A.1.2.  HAN Security\n   In any network, we have a variety of threats and a variety\
    \ of\n   possible mitigations.  These include, at minimum:\n   Link Layer:  Why\
    \ is your machine able to talk in my network?  The\n      WiFi SSIDs often use\
    \ some form of authenticated access control,\n      which may be a simple encrypted\
    \ password mechanism or may use a\n      combination of encryption and IEEE 802.1X+EAP-TLS\
    \ Authentication/\n      Authorization to ensure that only authorized communicants\
    \ can use\n      it.  If a LAN has a router attached, the router may also implement\n\
    \      a firewall to filter remote accesses.\n   Network Layer:  Given that your\
    \ machine is authorized access to my\n      network, why is your machine talking\
    \ with my machine?  IPsec is a\n      way of ensuring that computers that can\
    \ use a network are allowed\n      to talk with each other, may also enforce confidentiality,\
    \ and may\n      provide VPN services to make a device or network appear to be\
    \ part\n      of a remote network.\n   Application:  Given that your machine is\
    \ authorized access to my\n      network and my machine, why is your application\
    \ talking with my\n      application?  The fact that your machine and mine are\
    \ allowed to\n      talk for some applications doesn't mean they are allowed to\
    \ for\n      all applications.  (D)TLS, https, and other such mechanisms enable\n\
    \      an application to impose application-to-application controls\n      similar\
    \ to the network layer controls provided by IPsec.\n   Remote Application:  How\
    \ do I know that the data I received is the\n      data you sent?  Especially\
    \ in applications like electronic mail,\n      where data passes through a number\
    \ of intermediaries that one may\n      or may not really want munging it (how\
    \ many times have you seen a\n      URL broken by a mail server?), we have tools\
    \ (DKIM, S/MIME, and\n      W3C XML Signatures to name a few) to provide non-repudiability\
    \ and\n      integrity verification.  This may also have legal ramifications:\n\
    \      if a record of a meter reading is to be used in billing, and the\n    \
    \  bill is disputed in court, one could imagine the court wanting\n      proof\
    \ that the record in fact came from that meter at that time\n      and contained\
    \ that data.\n   Application-specific security:  In addition, applications often\n\
    \      provide security services of their own.  The fact that I can\n      access\
    \ a file system, for example, doesn't mean that I am\n      authorized to access\
    \ everything in it; the file system may well\n      prevent my access to some\
    \ of its contents.  Routing protocols like\n      BGP are obsessed with the question\
    \ \"what statements that my peer\n      made am I willing to believe\", and monitoring\
    \ protocols like SNMP\n      may not be willing to answer every question they\
    \ are asked,\n      depending on access configuration.\n   Devices in the HAN\
    \ want controlled access to the LAN in question for\n   obvious reasons.  In addition,\
    \ there should be some form of mutual\n   authentication between devices -- the\
    \ lamp controller will want to\n   know that the light switch telling it to change\
    \ state is the right\n   light switch, for example.  The EMS may well want strong\n\
    \   authentication of accesses -- the parents may not want the children\n   changing\
    \ the settings, and while the utility and the customer are\n   routinely granted\
    \ access, other parties (especially parties with\n   criminal intent) need to\
    \ be excluded.\n"
- title: 'A.2.  Model 1: AMI with Separated Domains'
  contents:
  - "A.2.  Model 1: AMI with Separated Domains\n   With the background given in Appendix\
    \ A.1, we can now discuss the use\n   of IP (IPv4 or IPv6) in the AMI.\n   In\
    \ this first model, consider the three domains in Figure 6 to\n   literally be\
    \ separate administrative domains, potentially operated by\n   different entities.\
    \  For example, the NAN could be a WiMAX network\n   operated by a traditional\
    \ telecom operator, the utility's network\n   (including the collector) is its\
    \ own, and the residential network is\n   operated by the resident.  In this model,\
    \ while communications\n   between the collector and the Meter are normal, the\
    \ utility has no\n   other access to appliances in the home, and the collector\
    \ doesn't\n   directly forward messages from the NAN upstream.\n   In this case,\
    \ as shown in Figure 7, it would make the most sense to\n   design the collector,\
    \ the Meter, and the EMS as hosts on the NAN --\n   design them as systems whose\
    \ applications can originate and terminate\n   exchanges or sessions in the NAN,\
    \ but not forward traffic from or to\n   other devices.\n   In such a configuration,\
    \ Demand Response has to be performed by\n   having the EMS accept messages such\
    \ as price signals from the \"pole\n   top\", apply some form of policy, and then\
    \ orchestrate actions within\n   the home.  Another possibility is to have the\
    \ EMS communicate with\n   the ESI located in the meter.  If the thermostat has\
    \ high demand and\n   low demand (day/night or morning/day/evening/night) settings,\
    \ Demand\n   Response might result in it moving to a lower demand setting, and\
    \ the\n   EMS might also turn off specified circuits in the home to diminish\n\
    \   lighting.\n   In this scenario, Quality of Service (QoS) issues reportedly\
    \ arise\n   when high precedence messages must be sent through the collector to\n\
    \   the home; if the collector is occupied polling the meters or doing\n   some\
    \ other task, the application may not yield control of the\n   processor to the\
    \ application that services the message.  Clearly,\n   this is either an application\
    \ or an Operating System problem;\n   applications need to be designed in a manner\
    \ that doesn't block high\n   precedence messages.  The collector also needs to\
    \ use appropriate NAN\n   services, if they exist, to provide the NAN QoS it needs.\
    \  For\n   example, if WiMax is in use, it might use a routine-level service for\n\
    \   normal exchanges but a higher precedence service for these messages.\n"
