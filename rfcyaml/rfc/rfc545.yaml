    \      A Response to \"Feast of Famine\"\n   In RFC 531, M.A. Padlipsky complains\
    \ that the UCSB resource\n   evaluators were derelict in not consulting the Resource\
    \ Notebook for\n   available documentation.  In addition, Padlipsky equates the\
    \ goals of\n   the resource evaluators to the goals of the software repository\n\
    \   advocaters.  A misunderstanding exists and perhaps, with this note,\n   may\
    \ be cleared.\n   To respond to Padlipsky's example of UCSB botching login attempts\
    \ let\n   me make two comments.  First, more people than the resource\n   evaluators\
    \ were accessing the ARPANET.  The group of evaluators, at\n   least, knew the\
    \ login procedure from the Resource Notebook. (By the\n   way, we do have a Multics\
    \ Programmers Manual.) Second, the OLS TELNET\n   echoes no lower case, which\
    \ can generate confusion.  Even UCSB's\n   technical liaison, after consulting\
    \ the Resource Notebook, managed to\n   botch his login.\n   The first law of\
    \ resource evaluation, at least for UCSB evaluators,\n   is \"read the Resource\
    \ Notebook!\" (RFC 369, incidentally, was based on\n   a Resource Notebook that\
    \ was barren compared to the notebook of\n   today.)  Questions left unanswered\
    \ by the Notebook are resolved by\n   accessing online documentation first at\
    \ the NIC and second at the\n   site being evaluated.  If, after all this effort,\
    \ questions still\n   exist, then a consultant is contacted.  Consultation may\
    \ be either\n   online or by telephone and may entail purchasing appropriate user\n\
    \   manuals (for some of the resources we evaluated, no manuals existed).\n  \
    \ Our approach has been to consult the most publicly available\n   documentation\
    \ first.  Only if the advertised paths fail do we resort\n   to personal contact\
    \ with a (busy) technical liaison.  If technical\n   liaisons wish to be consultants\
    \ for uninitiated users and feel that\n   this is their role we will gladly modify\
    \ our behavior.\n   There certainly is a meal, to use Padlipsky's analogy, of\n\
    \   documentation already available on the Network.  However, a meal is\n   no\
    \ good without silverware.  Site specific and function specific\n   MINIMANS (see\
    \ RFC 369 and RFC 519) are attempts to provide this\n   tableware.  Our first-pass\
    \ MINIMANS are available on request for\n   those who would like to see what we\
    \ are trying to do.\n   Resource evaluators are concerned with much more than\
    \ documentation.\n   A closer reading of prior RFC's would have shown that we\
    \ investigate\n   dynamic phenomenon such as help facilities, online consultation,\n\
    \   response time, reliability, and human engineering.  We make\n   suggestions\
    \ for improvement.  Indeed we see ourselves, at least for\n   UCSB users, in the\
    \ role of plain clothes inspector.  We don't claim\n   absolute efficiency but\
    \ we do claim good intent and good results.  We\n   have spurred improvements\
    \ at local as well as foreign network sites.\n   We apologize to any we may have\
    \ offended in the past with poor\n   reviews.  We are learning, continually, how\
    \ best to say things in a\n   constructive rather than destructive way.\n    \
