    Experimental Ethernet Networks\n"
  title: __initial_text__
- contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This RFC specifies a standard method of encapsulating
    Internet\n   Protocol (IP) [1] datagrams on an Experimental Ethernet [2].  This\n
    \  RFC specifies a standard protocol for the ARPA Internet community.\n"
  title: Status of this Memo
- contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This memo applies to the Experimental Ethernet (3-megabit/second,\n
    \  8-bit addresses).  The procedure for transmission of IP datagrams on\n   the
    Ethernet (10-megabit/second, 48-bit addresses) is described in\n   [3].\n"

  - "Frame Format\n   IP datagrams are transmitted in standard Experimental Ethernet\n
    \  frames.  The type field of the Ethernet frame must contain the value\n   513
    (1001 octal).  The data field contains the IP header followed\n   immediately
    by the IP data.\n   If necessary, the data field should be padded to meet the\n
    \  Experimental Ethernet minimum frame size.  This padding is not part\n   of
    the IP packet and is not included in the total length field of the\n   IP header.\n
    \  The maximum length of an IP datagram sent over an Experimental\n   Ethernet
    is 1536 octets.  Implementations are encouraged to support\n   full-length packets.
    \ Gateway implementations MUST be prepared to\n   accept full-length packets and
    fragment them if necessary.  If a\n   system cannot receive full-length packets,
    it should take steps to\n   discourage others from sending them, such as using
    the TCP Maximum\n   Segment Size option [4].\n   Note:  Datagrams on the Ethernet
    may be longer than the general\n   Internet default maximum packet size of 576
    octets.  Hosts connected\n   to an Ethernet should keep this in mind when sending
    datagrams to\n   hosts not on the same Ethernet.  It may be appropriate to send\n
    \  smaller datagrams to avoid unnecessary fragmentation at intermediate\n   gateways.
    \ Please see [4] for further information on this point.\n"

  - "Address Mappings\n   The mapping between 32-bit Internet addresses to 8-bit Experimental\n
    \  Ethernet addresses can be done several ways.\n   The easiest thing to do is
    to use the last eight bits of host number\n   part of the Internet address as
    the host's address on the\n   Experimental Ethernet.  This is the recommended
    approach.\n   Broadcast Address\n      The broadcast Internet address (the address
    on that network with a\n      host part of all binary ones) should be mapped to
    the broadcast\n      Experimental Ethernet address (address zero).\n"

  - "Trailer Formats\n   Some versions of Unix 4.2bsd use a different encapsulation
    method in\n   order to get better network performance with the VAX virtual memory\n
    \  architecture.  Consenting systems on the same Ethernet may use this\n   format
    between themselves.\n   No host is required to implement it, and no datagrams
    in this format\n   should be sent to any host unless the sender has positive knowledge\n
    \  that the recipient will be able to interpret them.  Details of the\n   trailer
    encapsulation may be found in [6].\n   (Note:  At the present time Unix 4.2bsd
    will either always use\n   trailers or never use them (per interface), depending
    on a boot-time\n   option.  This is expected to be changed in the future.  Unix
    4.2bsd\n   also uses a non-standard Internet broadcast address with a host part\n
    \  of all zeroes, this will also be changed in the future.)\n"
