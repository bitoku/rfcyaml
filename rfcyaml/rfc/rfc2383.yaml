  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies an ATM-based protocol for communication\n\
    \   between ST2+ agents. The ST2+ over ATM protocol supports the matching\n  \
    \ of one hop in an ST2+ tree-structure stream with one ATM connection.\n   In\
    \ this document, ATM is a subnet technology for the ST2+ stream.\n   The ST2+\
    \ over ATM protocol is designed to achieve resource-\n   reservation communications\
    \ across ATM and non-ATM networks, to extend\n   the UNI 3.1/4.0 signaling functions,\
    \ and to reduce the UNI 4.0 LIJ\n   signaling limitations.\n   The specifications\
    \ of the ST2+ over ATM protocol consist of a\n   revision of RFC 1819 ST2+ and\
    \ specifications of protocol interaction\n   between ST2+ and ATM on the user\
    \ plane, management plane, and control\n   plane which correspond to the three\
    \ planes of the B-ISDN protocol\n   reference model.\n"

  - "1.1 Purpose of Document\n   The purpose of this document is to specify an ATM-based\
    \ protocol for\n   communication between ST2+ agents.\n   The ST2+ over ATM protocol\
    \ is designed to support the matching of one\n   hop in an ST2+ tree-structure\
    \ stream with one ATM connection; it is\n   not designed to support an entire\
    \ ST2+ tree-structure stream with a\n   point-to-multipoint ATM connection only.\n\
    \   Therefore, in this document, ATM is only a subnet technology for the\n   ST2+\
    \ stream.  This specification is designed to enable resource-\n   reservation\
    \ communications across ATM and non-ATM networks.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.2 Features of ST2+ over ATM Protocol\n   o Enables resource-reservation communications\
    \ across ATM and non-ATM\n     networks.\n     ATM native API supports resource-reservation\
    \ communications only\n     within an ATM network; it cannot support interworking\
    \ with non-ATM\n     networks. This is because\n     - ATM native API cannot connect\
    \ terminals without an ATM interface.\n     - ATM native API does not support\
    \ IP addressing and SAP (port)\n       addressing systems.\n   o Extends UNI 3.1/4.0\
    \ signaling functions.\n     ST2+ SCMP supports MTU-size negotiation at all hops\
    \ in an ST2+\n     tree-structure stream. UNI 3.1/4.0 supports only max CPCS_SDU\n\
    \     (i.e., MTU) negotiation with the called party of a point-to-point\n    \
    \ call or with the first leaf of a point-to-multipoint call.\n   o Reduces UNI\
    \ 4.0 LIJ signaling limitations.\n     The ST2+ over ATM protocol supports UNI\
    \ 4.0 LIJ Call Identifier\n     notification from the root to the leaf by using\
    \ an ST2+ SCMP\n     extension.  LIJ Call Identifier discovery at the leaf is\
    \ one of the\n     major unsolved problems of UNI 4.0, and the ST2+ over ATM protocol\n\
    \     provides a solution.\n     Note: The UNI 3.1 version of the ST2+ over ATM\
    \ protocol does not\n     support the above feature. It will be supported by the\
    \ UNI 3.1/4.0\n     version.\n"
- title: 1.3 Goals and Non-goals of ST2+ over ATM Protocol
  contents:
  - "1.3 Goals and Non-goals of ST2+ over ATM Protocol\n   The ST2+ over ATM protocol\
    \ is designed to achieve the following\n   goals.\n   o Specify protocol interaction\
    \ between ST2+ [4] and ATM on the ATM\n     Forum Private UNI 3.1/4.0 (Sb point)\
    \ [10, 11].\n     Note: The UNI 3.1 version of the ST2+ over ATM protocol does\
    \ not\n     support UNI 4.0. It will be supported by the UNI 3.1/4.0 version.\n\
    \   o Support ST2+ stream across ATM and non-ATM networks.\n   o Define one VC\
    \ on the UNI corresponding to one ST2+ hop; this VC is\n     not shared with other\
    \ ST2+ hops, and also this ST2+ hop is not\n     divided into multiple VCs.\n\
    \   o Support both SVC and PVC.\n   o Not require any ATM specification changes.\n\
    \   o Coexist with RFC 1483 [16] IPv4 encapsulation.\n   o Coexist with RFC 1577\
    \ [17] ATMarp.\n   o Coexist with RFC 1755 [18] ATM signaling for IPv4.\n   o\
    \ Coexist with NHRP [19].\n   Because ST2+ is independent of both routing and\
    \ IP address resolution\n   protocols, the ST2+ over ATM protocol does not specify\
    \ the following\n   protocols.\n   o IP-ATM address resolution protocol\n   o\
    \ Routing protocol\n   Because the ST2+ over ATM protocol is specified for the\
    \ UNI, it is\n   independent of:\n   o NNI protocol\n   o Router/switch architecture\n"

    \ 3.1 version of the ST2+ over ATM protocol does not\n   support Guaranteed Services.\
    \ It will be supported by the UNI 3.1/4.0\n   version.\n   The ST2+ over ATM protocol\
    \ specifies the ST FlowSpec format for the\n   Integrated Services.  Basically,\
    \ FlowSpec parameter negotiation,\n   except for the MTU, is not supported.  This\
    \ is because, in the ST2+\n   environment, negotiated FlowSpec parameters are\
    \ not always unique to\n   each target.  The current ATM standard does not support\
    \ heterogeneous\n   QoS to receivers.\n   The ST2+ over ATM protocol supports\
    \ FlowSpec changes by using the\n   CHANGE message (RFC 1819, Section 4.6.5) if\
    \ the I-bit in the CHANGE\n   message is set to one and if the CHANGE message\
    \ affects all targets\n   in the stream. This is because the UNI 3.1 does not\
    \ support QoS\n   changes. The ST2+ over ATM protocol supports FlowSpec changes\
    \ by\n   releasing old ATM connections and establishing new ones.\n   The ST2+\
    \ over ATM protocol does not support stream preemption (RFC\n   1819, Section\
    \ 6.3).  This is because the Integrated Services FlowSpec\n   does not support\
    \ the concept of precedence.\n   It does not support the ST2+ FlowSpec (RFC 1819,\
    \ Section 9.2).  ST2+\n   FlowSpec specifies useful services, but requires a datalink\
    \ layer to\n   support heterogeneous QoS to receivers.  The current ATM standard\n\
    \   does not support heterogeneous QoS to receivers.\n"

    \ 2.5: Example of ST2+ SCMP and UNI 3.1 signaling message flows.\n   UNI 3.1/4.0\
    \ specifies PVC, point-to-point SVC, and point-to-\n   multipoint SVC as VC styles.\
    \ However, in actual ATM network\n   environments, especially public ATM WANs,\
    \ only PVC and bi-directional\n   point-to-point SVC may be supported.  To support\
    \ the diverse VC\n   styles, the ST2+ over ATM protocol supports the following\
    \ VC styles\n   for ST2+ Data PDU transfer.\n   o PVC\n   o Reuse of reverse channel\
    \ of bi-directional point-to-point SVC that\n     is used by existing stream.\n\
    \   o Point-to-point SVC initiated from upstream side.\n   o Point-to-multipoint\
    \ SVC initiated from upstream side.\n   o Point-to-point SVC initiated from downstream\
    \ side.\n   o Point-to-multipoint SVC initiated from downstream side (LIJ).\n\
    \     Note: The UNI 3.1 version of the ST2+ over ATM protocol does not\n     support\
    \ LIJ.  LIJ will be supported by the UNI 3.1/4.0 version.\n   The second style\
    \ is needed in environments supporting bi-directional\n   point-to-point SVC only.\
    \  The selection of PVC and SVC styles in the\n   ST2+ agent is based on preconfigured\
    \ implementation-dependent rules.\n   SVC supports both upstream and downstream\
    \ call initiation styles.\n   Implementors should note that this is independent\
    \ of the sender-\n   oriented and receiver-oriented ST2+ stream-building process\
    \ (RFC\n   1819, Section 4.1.1).  This is because the ST2+ over ATM protocol\n\
    \   specifies the process for establishing ST2+ data hops on the UNI, and\n  \
    \ because the ST2+ stream building process belongs to another layer.\n   The SVC\
    \ initiation side should be determined based on the operational\n   and billing\
    \ policies between ST2+ agents; this is basically\n   independent of the sender-oriented\
    \ and receiver-oriented ST2+\n   stream-building process.\n   An example of ST2+\

    \ for the Controlled-Load Service,\n   if the value of the [m] field is more than\
    \ that of the [M] field, the\n   value of the [m] field is regarded as the same\
    \ value as the [M]\n   field, and must not generate an error. This is because\
    \ there is a\n   possibility that the value of the [M] field in the ACCEPT message\
    \ may\n   be decreased by negotiation.\n   In the ST2+ SCMP messages, the value\
    \ of the [M] field must be equal\n   to or less than 65,535.  In the ACCEPT message\
    \ that responds to\n   CONNECT, or the NOTIFY message that contains the FlowSpec\
    \ field, the\n   value of the [M] field must be equal to the MaxMsgSize field\
    \ in the\n   message.  If these values are not the same, FlowSpec is regarded\
    \ as\n   an error.\n   If the ST2+ agent receives the CONNECT message that contains\n\
    \   unacceptable FlowSpec, the agent must generate a REFUSE message.\n"
