  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a method of implementing V5.2 backhaul\n
    \  messaging over IP using a modified version of the ISDN User\n   Adaptation
    Layer Protocol (IUAP) [1].  V5UA builds on top of IUA,\n   defining the necessary
    extensions to IUA for a V5.2 implementation.\n   Since V5UA is meant to be an
    extension to IUAP, everything defined in\n   [1] is also valid for V5UA unless
    otherwise specified in this\n   document.\n   This document does not describe
    the V5 standard itself.  The V5\n   protocol is defined by ETSI standards [2,3].
    \ Any description of the\n   V5 protocol in this document is meant to make the
    text easier to\n   understand.\n"

      protocol\n   delivery from a V5.2 Signaling Gateway (SG) to a Media Gateway\n
      \  Controller (MGC), analogous to the implementation of the ISDN Q.921\n   User
      Adaptation Layer (IUA) as described in [1].\n   This document supports analog
      telephone access, ISDN basic rate\n   access and ISDN Primary rate access over
      a V5.2 interface.\n   Since the V5.2 Layer 2, and especially Layer 3, differs
      from the\n   Q.921 [4] and Q.931 Adaptation layer, the IUA standard must be\n
      \  extended to fulfil the needs for supporting V5.2.\n"

    - "1.3.  V5.2 Overview\n   V5.2 is an industry standard ETSI interface (reference
      ETS 300 347-1\n   [3]) defined between a Local Exchange (LE) and an Access Network
      (AN)\n   providing access to the following types:\n      -  Analog telephone
      access\n      -  ISDN Basic rate access\n      -  ISDN Primary Rate access\n
      \     -  Other analog or digital accesses for semi-permanent connections\n         without
      associated outband signaling information\n   The original V5 specification (V5.1
      [2]) uses 2048 kbps links in a\n   non-concentrating fashion.  In contrast,
      V5.2 may use up to 16 such\n   interface links and supports concentration.\n

      \ /\n            ----------              ----------         --\n   The LE and
      AN are connected with up to 16 E1 (PCM30) links.  Channels\n   16, 15 and 31
      on any E1 link can be reserved for data communication\n   between LE and AN.
      \ The channels reserved for data are called\n   \"Communication Channels\" or
      \"C-channels.\"\n   The C-channels are the physical media that exchange data
      between the\n   V5.2 protocol peer entities, as well as transfer the ISDN BRI\n
      \  D-channel messages between the terminals and the LE.  A logical\n   communication
      path between two peer entities for one protocol is\n   called a \"C-path\".\n

      are carried by means of the V5 PSTN protocol\n         (L3)\n      -  ISDN/analog
      ports are controlled by the V5 Control protocol\n         (L3)\n      -  ISDN
      protocol messages are mapped to LAPD frames, which are\n         carried by
      means of LAPV5-EF sublayer (L2)\n      -  V5 protocol messages are mapped to
      LAPV5-DL frames, which are\n         carried by means of LAPV5-EF sublayer (L2)\n
      \  In order to support more traffic and dynamic allocation of bearer\n   channels,
      the V5.2 protocol has several additions:\n      -  A bearer channel connection
      protocol establishes and\n         disestablishes bearer connections on demand,
      as determined by\n         the signaling information, under the control of the
      Local\n         Exchange.\n      -  A link control protocol is defined for multi-link
      management to\n         control link identification, link blocking and link
      failure\n         conditions.\n      -  A protection protocol, operating on
      two separate V5 data links\n         is defined to manage the protection switching
      of communication\n         channels in case of link failures.\n   The following
      protocols are defined for the various protocol layers:\n   Layer 2:\n      -
      LAPV5-EF\n      - LAPV5-DL\n   Layer 3:\n      - V5-Link Control\n      - V5-BCC\n

      - "1.6.1.  V5 specific boundary primitives\n   Extending IUAP to V5UA to support
        V5.2 backhaul requires the\n   introduction of new boundary primitives for
        the Q.921/Q.931 boundary,\n   in accordance with the definitions in the V5
        standards.\n   V5UA reuses some IUA primitives from the Q.921/Q.931 boundary:
        the\n   DL-DATA primitive and the DL-UNIT DATA primitive.  The DL-DATA\n   primitive
        is used for the transportation of both V5 Layer 3 messages\n   and V5 ISDN
        Layer 3 messages.  The DL-UNIT DATA primitive is only\n   used for V5 ISDN
        messages and is used and defined as described for\n   IUAP.\n   In the V5
        standards, V5 system management is responsible for\n   establishing and releasing
        data links.  Therefore, for V5UA the DL-\n   Establish and DL-Release primitives
        defined in IUAP are replaced by\n   new primitives between system management
        and the data link layer in\n   accordance with the definitions in [2]:\n   MDL-ESTABLISH\n
        \  The MDL-Establish primitives are used to request, indicate and\n   confirm
        the outcome of the procedures for establishing multiple frame\n   operation.\n
        \  MDL-RELEASE\n   The MDL-Release primitive is used to indicate the outcome
        of the\n   procedures for terminating multiple frame operation.\n   In contrast
        to ISDN, the V5 standards demand that V5.2 system\n   management interacts
        directly with V5.2 layer 1.  Since V5.2 Layer 1\n   (including the L1 FSM)
        and parts of V5 system management are\n   physically separated in a V5 backhaul
        scenario, V5UA must support\n   some services for the communication between
        these two entities.\n   Specifically, these services include an indication
        of the status of a\n   specific link, and messages to support the link identification\n
        \  procedure defined by the V5 standards.\n   The new primitive are defined
        as shown below:\n   MPH-LINK STATUS START REPORTING\n   The MPH-LINK STATUS
        START REPORTING primitive is used by V5 system\n   management to request that
        a link be brought into service for use in\n   a V5 interface.  On reception
        of this message, the L1 FSM on the SG\n   SHALL start reporting the status
        of the V5 link to the MGC.  This\n   primitive is used similarly to the MPH-proceed
        primitive defined by\n   V5.2, but it has a more extended meaning than MPH-proceed.\n
        \  MPH-LINK STATUS STOP REPORTING\n   The MPH-LINK STATUS STOP REPORTING primitive
        is used by V5 system\n   management to request that a link be taken out of
        service on a V5\n   interface.  On reception of this message, L1 FSM on the
        SG SHALL stop\n   reporting the status of the V5 link to the GWC.  This primitive
        is\n   used similarly to the MPH-stop primitive defined by V5.2, but it has\n
        \  a more extended meaning than MPH-stop.\n   MPH-LINK STATUS INDICATION\n
        \  The MPH-LINK STATUS INDICATION primitive is used by L1 FSM on the\n   Signaling
        Gateway to report the status (operational/non-operational)\n   of a V5 link
        to V5 system management.  This primitive is equivalent\n   to the MPH-AI and
        MPH-DI primitives in V5.2.\n   MPH-SA-BIT SET\n   The MPH-SA-BIT SET primitive
        is used by system management to request\n   that the L1 FSM in the SG sets
        or resets the value of a specified Sa\n   bit on the requested link.  The
        SG uses it to report the successful\n   setting or resetting of this bit back
        to system management.  For V5,\n   this message is used for the V5 specific
        Link Identification\n   procedure to set/reset the value of the Sa7 bit, or
        to confirm the\n   successful setting of the Sa bit.  The MPH-SA BIT SET REQUEST
        is\n   equivalent to the MPH-ID and MPH-NOR primitives in V5.2.\n   MPH-SA-BIT
        STATUS\n   The MPH-SA-BIT STATUS primitives are used by system management
        in the\n   MGC to request that the L1 FSM in the SG reports the status of
        a\n   specified Sa bit on the requested link.  The SG uses it to report\n
        \  (indicate) the status of this bit back to system management.  For V5,\n
        \  these messages are used for the V5 specific Link identification\n   procedure
        to request or report the status of the Sa7 bit.  This is\n   equivalent to
        the MPH-IDR, MPH-IDI or MPH-Elg primitives in V5.2.\n   Due to the separation
        of V5 System Management and V5 Layer1/Layer2 in\n   the V5UA backhaul architecture,
        it may be necessary to report error\n   conditions of the SG's V5 stack to
        V5 System Management.  For this\n   purpose, a new primitive is defined:\n
        \  MDL-ERROR INDICATION\n   The MDL-ERROR INDICATION primitive is used to
        indicate an error\n   condition to V5 System Management.  The only valid reason
        for this\n   primitive is 'Overload', indicating an overload condition of
        the\n   C-channel on the SG.  This reason is not defined in the V5/Q.921\n
        \  standards.\n"

    - "4.2.  V5 Naming Conventions for Interface Identifier\n   The V5 standard demands
      that V5 System Management keep track of the\n   states of all links on a V5
      interface.  To perform tasks like\n   protection switching and bearer channel
      allocation on the V5 links,\n   it is necessary that system management has the
      full picture of the\n   signaling and bearer channels located on each link.\n
      \  The IUA protocol identifies C-channels by endpoints without a defined\n   association
      with a specific link.  Since no naming convention exists,\n   there is no guarantee
      that a C-channel is actually located at the\n   link it claims to be.  Furthermore
      the V5 standard requires that the\n   MGC receives reports of the status of
      all links, and it defines a\n   link identification procedure to ensure that
      AN and LE are\n   referencing the same link when they address a link with a
      Link\n   Control Protocol message.\n   It would clearly be against the concept
      of V5.2 if there was no clear\n   association between E1 links and channels.
      \ To solve this problem, a\n   naming convention MUST be used for V5UA.\n   The

      \  The Link Status Messages are used between V5 System Management on the\n   MGC
      and the L1 FSM on the SG to track the status of a particular E1\n   link.  This
      is required whether or not the E1 link carries\n   C-channels.\n   All Link
      Status Messages contain the V5UA Message Header.  The Link\n   Identifier portion
      of the Interface Identifier identifies the\n   physical link on the SG addressed
      by the message.  For all link\n   status messages, the Chnl ID SHALL be set
      to '0' and SHALL be ignored\n   by the receiver.\n   The integer value used
      for the Link Identifier is of local\n   significance only, and is coordinated
      between the SG and MGC.  It\n   MUST be unique for every V5 link on the SG.\n
      \  As defined by the V5 standards, V5 System Management must know the\n   status
      of the links on all active V5 interfaces.  The Link Status\n   Start Reporting
      Message is used by V5 System Management on the MGC to\n   request that the L1
      FSM on the SG starts reporting the status of a\n   particular link.\n   V5 system
      management SHALL send this Message on interface activation\n   for all links
      on the interface.  The SG SHALL respond immediately to\n   this request with
      a Link Status Indication message, and it SHALL then\n   send a Link Status Indication
      message on all subsequent changes of\n   the link status.  Since the SG has
      no other way to determine whether\n   a link is on an active interface or not,
      this message SHALL always be\n   sent on interface startup.\n   If the L1 FSM
      in the SG receives a Link Status Start Reporting\n   Message for a link that
      is already active (the link status is\n   reported to System Management), the
      SG SHALL immediately report the\n   actual status of this link by sending a
      Link Status Indication\n   Message.  The SG SHALL then proceed with the automatic
      link status\n   reporting as described above.\n   To stop this reporting of
      the status of a link, e.g., at interface\n   deactivation, System Management
      sends a Link Status Stop Reporting\n   Message to the L1 FSM.  The SG will then
      immediately stop reporting\n   the status of the particular link and will assume
      the link to be out\n   of service.  It MUST NOT respond in any way to this message.\n
      \  Since there is no other way for the SG to know that an interface has\n   been
      deactivated, this message SHALL be sent on interface\n   deactivation for all
      links on the interface.  On reception of this\n   message, the SG SHALL take
      L2 down on this link.\n   If the L1 FSM in the SG receives a Link Status Stop
      Reporting Message\n   for a link that is not active (the link status is not
      reported to\n   System Management), the SG SHALL ignore the message.\n   The
      Link Status Start/Stop Reporting Messages contain the common\n   message header
      followed by the V5UA message header.  They do not\n   contain any additional
      parameters.\n   The Link Status Indication Message is used by L1 FSM in the
      SG in\n   response to a Link Status Start Reporting Message to indicate the\n
      \  status of the particular link.  After a Link Status Start Reporting\n   Message
      has been received by the L1 FSM, it SHALL automatically send\n   a Link Status

      is described in the V5\n   standards[2,3] as follows:\n      -  The L1 FSM detects
      the V5 Layer 1 failure.  It reports this to\n         V5 System management by
      sending a MPH-DI primitive for the\n         affected link.\n      -  V5 System
      management notifies V5 Layer 2 of the V5 Layer 1\n         outage by sending
      a MPH-Layer_1 Failure Ind primitive.\n   Since V5 Layer1/2 and V5 System Management
      are no longer co-located\n   in the backhaul architecture, it does not make
      sense to notify V5\n   Layer 2 about V5 Layer 1 failure via V5 system management.
      \ Instead,\n   V5 Layer 2 SHALL be notified directly by V5 Layer 1 on the SG.
      \ V5\n   Layer 1 SHALL report the outage to V5 system management by sending
      a\n   Link Status Indication message with status NON-OPERATIONAL,\n   corresponding
      to an MPH-DI primitive as defined by the V5.2 standard.\n   V5 system management
      SHALL NOT send an MPH-Layer_1 Failure Ind\n   primitive to V5 Layer 2 in response
      to this message.\n"

      on a C-channel, it SHOULD\n   indicate this by sending an Error Indication message,
      with the reason\n   Overload to the MGC.  The MGC SHOULD then take appropriate
      actions to\n   clear this overload condition.\n   The SG SHALL resend the Error
      Indication message with the reason\n   Overload as long as the overload condition
