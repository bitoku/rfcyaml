    an identifier of\n   \"vacation\" for use with the capability mechanism.\n"

  - "4.  Vacation Action\n   Usage:   vacation [\":days\" number] [\":subject\" string]\n
    \                    [\":from\" string] [\":addresses\" string-list]\n                     [\":mime\"]
    [\":handle\" string] <reason: string>\n   The \"vacation\" action implements a
    vacation autoresponder similar to\n   the vacation command available under many
    versions of Unix.  Its\n   purpose is to provide correspondents with notification
    that the user\n   is away for an extended period of time and that they should
    not\n   expect quick responses.\n   \"Vacation\" is used to respond to a message
    with another message.\n   Vacation's messages are always addressed to the Return-Path
    address\n   (that is, the envelope from address) of the message being responded\n
    \  to.\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Days Parameter\n   The \":days\" argument is used to specify the period
      in which addresses\n   are kept and are not responded to, and is always specified
      in days.\n   The minimum value used for this parameter is normally 1.  Sites
      MAY\n   define a different minimum value as long as the minimum is greater\n
      \  than 0.  Sites MAY also define a maximum days value, which MUST be\n   greater
      than 7, and SHOULD be greater than 30.\n   If \":days\" is omitted, the default
      value is either 7 or the minimum\n   value (as defined above), whichever is
      greater.\n   If the parameter given to \":days\" is less than the minimum value,\n
      \  then the minimum value is used instead.\n   If \":days\" exceeds the site-defined
      maximum, the site-defined maximum\n   is used instead.\n"
    title: 4.1.  Days Parameter

    - "4.2.  Previous Response Tracking\n   \"Vacation\" keeps track of all the responses
      it has sent to each\n   address in some period (as specified by the :days optional
      argument).\n   If vacation has not previously sent the response to this address\n
      \  within the given time period, it sends the \"reason\" argument to the\n   SMTP
      MAIL FROM address [RFC2821] of the message that is being\n   responded to.  (The
      SMTP MAIL FROM address should be available in the\n   Return-path: header field
      if Sieve processing occurs after final\n   delivery.)\n   Tracking is not just
      per address, but must also take the vacation\n   response itself into account.
      \ A script writer might, for example,\n   have a vacation action that will send
      a general notice only once in\n   any two-week period.  However, even if a sender
      has received this\n   general notice, it may be important to send a specific
      notice when a\n   message about something timely or something specific has been\n
      \  detected.\n   A particular vacation response can be identified in one of
      two ways.\n   The first way is via an explicit :handle argument, which attaches
      a\n   name to the response.  All vacation statements that use the same\n   handle
      will be considered the same response for tracking purposes.\n   The second way
      is via a synthesis of the :subject, :from, :mime, and\n   reason vacation command
      arguments.  All vacation actions that do not\n   contain an explicit handle
      and that use an identical combination of\n   these arguments are considered
      the same for tracking purposes.\n   For instance, if coyote@desert.example.org
      sends mail to\n   roadrunner@acme.example.com twice, once with the subject \"Cyrus
      bug\"\n   and once with the subject \"come over for dinner\", and\n   roadrunner@acme.example.com
      has the script shown below,\n   coyote@desert.example.org would receive two
      responses, one with the\n   first message, one with the second.\n   require
      \"vacation\";\n   if header :contains \"subject\" \"cyrus\" {\n       vacation
      \"I'm out -- send mail to cyrus-bugs\";\n   } else {\n       vacation \"I'm
      out -- call me at +1 304 555 0123\";\n   }\n   In the above example, coyote@desert.example.org
      gets the second\n   message despite having gotten the first one because separate
      vacation\n   responses have been triggered.  This behavior is REQUIRED.\n   There
      is one important exception to this rule, however.  If the Sieve\n   variables
      extension [RFC5229] is used, the arguments MUST NOT have\n   undergone variable
      expansion prior to their use in response tracking.\n   This is so that examples
      like the following script will only generate\n   a single response to each incoming
      message with a different subject\n   line.\n   require [\"vacation\", \"variables\"];\n
      \  if header :matches \"subject\" \"*\" {\n       vacation :subject \"Automatic
      response to: ${1}\"\n                \"I'm away -- send mail to foo in my absence\";\n
      \  }\n   As noted above, the optional \":handle\" parameter can be used to tell\n
      \  the Sieve interpreter to treat two vacation actions with different\n   arguments
      as the same command for purposes of response tracking.  The\n   argument to
      \":handle\" is a string that identifies the type of\n   response being sent.
      \ For instance, if tweety@cage.example.org sends\n   mail to spike@doghouse.example.com
      twice, one with the subject\n   \"lunch?\" and once with the subject \"dinner?\",
      and\n   spike@doghouse.example.com has the script shown below,\n   tweety@cage.example.org
      will only receive a single response.  (Which\n   response is sent depends on
      the order in which the messages are\n   processed.)\n   require \"vacation\";\n
      \  if header :contains \"subject\" \"lunch\" {\n       vacation :handle \"ran-away\"
      \"I'm out and can't meet for lunch\";\n   } else {\n       vacation :handle
      \"ran-away\" \"I'm out\";\n   }\n   NOTE: One way to implement the necessary
      mechanism here is to store a\n   hash of either the current handle and the recipient
      address or, if no\n   handle is provided, a hash of the vacation action parameters\n
      \  specifying the message content and the recipient address.  If a\n   script
      is changed, implementations MAY reset the records of who has\n   been responded
      to and when they have been responded to.\n   IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: Care must
      be taken in constructing a hash of\n   vacation action parameters.  In particular,
      since most parameters are\n   optional, it is important not to let the same
      string used as the\n   value for different parameters produce the same hash
      value.  One\n   possible way to accomplish this is to apply the hash to a series
      of\n   counted or null terminated strings, one for each possible parameter\n
      \  in particular order.\n   Implementations are free to limit the number of
      remembered responses;\n   however, the limit MUST NOT be less than 1000.  When
      limiting the\n   number of tracked responses, implementations SHOULD discard
      the\n   oldest ones first.\n"

    - "4.3.  Subject and From Parameters\n   The \":subject\" parameter specifies
      a subject line to attach to any\n   vacation response that is generated.  UTF-8
      characters can be used in\n   the string argument; implementations MUST convert
      the string to\n   [RFC2047] encoded words if and only if non-ASCII characters
      are\n   present.  Implementations MUST generate an appropriate default\n   subject
      line as specified below if no :subject parameter is\n   specified.\n   A \":from\"
      parameter may be used to specify an alternate address to\n   use in the From
      field of vacation messages.  The string must specify\n   a valid [RFC2822] mailbox-list.
      \ Implementations SHOULD check the\n   syntax and generate an error when a syntactically
      invalid \":from\"\n   parameter is specified.  Implementations MAY also impose
      restrictions\n   on what addresses can specified in a \":from\" parameter; it
      is\n   suggested that values that fail such a validity check simply be\n   ignored
      rather than cause the vacation action to fail.\n"

      parameter is not supplied, the reason string is\n   considered a UTF-8 string.\n

      like \"MAILER-DAEMON\", \"LISTSERV\", \"majordomo\", and other\n   addresses
      typically used only by automated systems.  Additionally,\n   addresses ending
      in \"-request\" or beginning in \"owner-\", i.e.,\n   reserved for mailing list

  - "7.  Internationalization Considerations\n   Internationalization capabilities
    provided by the base Sieve language\n   are discussed in [RFC5228].  However,
    the vacation extension is the\n   first Sieve extension to be defined that is
    capable of creating\n   entirely new messages.  This section deals with internationalization\n
    \  issues raised by the use of the vacation extension.\n   Vacation messages are
    normally written using the UTF-8 charset,\n   allowing text to be written in most
    of the world's languages.\n   Additionally, the :mime parameter allows specification
    of arbitrary\n   MIME content.  In particular, this makes it possible to use\n
    \  multipart/alternative objects to specify vacation responses in\n   multiple
    languages simultaneously.\n   The Sieve language itself allows a vacation response
    to be selected\n   based on the content of the original message.  For example,
    the\n   Accept-Language or Content-Language header fields [RFC3282] could be\n
    \  checked and used to select appropriate text:\n   require \"vacation\";\n   if
    header :contains [\"accept-language\", \"content-language\"] \"en\"\n   {\n       vacation
    \"I am away this week.\";\n   } else {\n       vacation \"Estoy ausente esta semana.\";\n
    \  }\n   Note that this rather simplistic test of the field values fails to\n
    \  take the structure of the fields into account and hence could be\n   fooled
    by some more complex field values.  A more elaborate test\n   could be used to
    deal with this problem.\n   The approach of explicitly coding language selection
    criteria in\n   scripts is preferred because in many cases language selection
    issues\n   are conflated with other selection issues.  For example, it may be\n
    \  appropriate to use informal text in one language for vacation\n   responses
    sent to a fellow employee while using more formal text in a\n   different language
    in a response sent to a total stranger outside the\n   company:\n   require \"vacation\";\n
    \  if address :matches \"from\" \"*@ourdivision.example.com\"\n   {\n       vacation
    :subject \"Gone fishing\"\n                \"Having lots of fun! Back in a day
    or two!\";\n   } else {\n       vacation :subject \"Je suis parti cette semaine\"\n
    \               \"Je lirai votre message quand je retourne.\";\n   }\n   IMPLEMENTATION
    NOTE: A graphical Sieve generation interface could in\n   principle be used to
    hide the complexity of specifying response\n   selection criteria from end users.
    \ Figuring out the right set of\n   options to present in a graphical interface
    is likely a nontrivial\n   proposition, but this is more because of the need to
    employ a variety\n   of criteria to select different sorts of responses to send
    to\n   different classes of people than because of the issues involved in\n   selecting
    a response in an appropriate language.\n"

    implement the behavior\n   and restrictions described throughout this document.
    \ Replies MUST\n   NOT be sent out in response to messages not sent directly to
    the\n   user, and replies MUST NOT be sent out more often than the :days\n   argument
    states unless the script changes.\n   If mail is forwarded from a site that uses
    subaddressing, it may be\n   impossible to list all recipient addresses with \":addresses\".\n
    \  Security issues associated with mail auto-responders are fully\n   discussed
    in the security considerations section of [RFC3834].  This\n   document is believed
    not to introduce any additional security\n   considerations in this general area.\n"
