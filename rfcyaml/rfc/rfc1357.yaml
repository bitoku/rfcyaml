  - "------------\n   Many Computer Science R&D organizations routinely announce new\n\
    \   technical reports by mailing (via the postal services) the\n   bibliographic\
    \ records of these reports.\n   These mailings have non-trivial cost and delay.\
    \  In addition, their\n   recipients cannot conveniently file them, electronically,\
    \ for later\n   retrieval and searches.\n   Therefore, it is suggested that the\
    \ publishing organizations would\n   e-mail these announcements by using the following\
    \ format.\n   Organizations may automate to any degree (or not at all) both the\n\
    \   creation of these records (about their own publications) and the\n   handling\
    \ of the records received from other organizations.\n   This format is designed\
    \ to be simple, for people and for machines,\n   to be easy to read (\"human readable\"\
    ) and create without any special\n   programs, and to be compatible with E-mail.\n\
    \   This format defines how bibliographic records are to be transmitted.\n   It\
    \ does not define what to do with them when received.\n   This format is a \"\
    tagged\" format with self-explaining alphabetic\n   tags. It should be possible\
    \ to prepare and to read bibliographic\n   records using any text editor, without\
    \ any special programs.\n   This format was developed with considerable help and\
    \ involvement of\n   Computer Science and Library personnel from several organizations,\n\
    \   including CMU, CNRI, Cornell, ISI, Meridian, MIT, Stanford, and UC.\n   Key\
    \ contributions were provided by Jerry Saltzer of MIT, and Larry\n   Lannom of\
    \ Meridian.  The initial draft was prepared by Danny Cohen\n   and Larry Miller\
    \ of ISI.\n   The use of this format is encouraged.  There are no limitations\
    \ on\n   its use.\n"

  - "-----------\n   * Keep It Simple.\n   * One bibliographic record for each publication,\
    \ where a\n     \"publication\" is whatever the publishing institution defines\n\
    \     as such.\n   * A record contains several fields.\n   * Each field starts\
    \ with its tag (aka the field-ID) which is a\n     reserved identifier (containing\
    \ no separators) at the beginning\n     of a new line with or without spaces before\
    \ it), followed by two\n     colons (\"::\"), followed by the field data.\n  \
    \ * Continuation lines:  Lines are limited to 79 characters.  When\n     needed,\
    \ fields may continue over several lines, with an implied\n     space in between.\
    \  In order to simplify the use no special marking\n     is used to indicate continuation\
    \ line.  Hence, fields are\n     terminated by a line that starts (apart from\
    \ white space) with\n     a word followed by two colons.  Except for the \"END::\"\
    \ that is\n     terminated by the end of line.)  For improved human readability\n\
    \     it is suggested to start continuation lines with some spaces.\n   * Several\
    \ fields are mandatory and must appear in the record.  All\n     fields (unless\
    \ specifically not permitted to) may be in any order\n     and may be repeated\
    \ as needed (e.g., the AUTHOR field).  The order\n     of the repeated fields\
    \ is always preserved.\n   * Only printable ASCII characters may be used.  Hence,\
    \ the\n     permissible characters are ASCII codes 040 (Space) through 176(~)\n\
    \     and line breaks which are \\012 (LF) or \\012\\015 (CRLF).  Empty\n    \
    \ lines indicate paragraph break.  \\009 (tab) must be replaced by\n     spaces\
    \ before submission.  This specifically forbids tabs, null\n     characters, DEL,\
    \ backspaces, etc.  (i.e., if used, the record is\n     invalid.)\n   Throughout\
    \ this document the word \"publisher\" means the publishing\n   organization of\
    \ a report (e.g., a university or a department\n   thereof), not necessarily an\
    \ organization authorized to issue ISBN\n   numbers.\n                       \

    \ of the \"ID:: XXX//YYY\") it is suggested\n   that the various organizations\
    \ that publish reports (such as\n   universities, departments, and laboratories)\
    \ register their\n   <publisher-ID> symbols and names, in a way similar to the\n\
    \   registration of other key parameters and names in the Internet.\n   Danny\
    \ Cohen <Cohen@ISI.EDU> of ISI, has agreed to coordinate this\n   registration\
    \ for the publishers of Computer Science technical\n   reports.  It is suggested\
    \ that before using this format the\n   publishing organizations would coordinate\
    \ with him (by e-mail) their\n   symbols and the names of their organizations.\
    \  [Discussions are in\n   progress to have these publisher-IDs registered with\
    \ the Internet\n   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and listed in future editions\
    \ of\n   the Assigned Numbers document.]\n   In order to help automated handling\
    \ of the received bibliographic\n   records, it is expected that the producers\
    \ of bibliographic records\n   will always use the same name, exactly, in the\
