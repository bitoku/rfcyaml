  - "1. Introduction\n   Security labels are an optional security service for S/MIME.\
    \  A\n   security label is a set of security information regarding the\n   sensitivity\
    \ of the content that is protected by S/MIME encapsulation.\n   A security label\
    \ can be included in the signed attributes of any\n   SignedData object.  A security\
    \ label attribute may be included in\n   either the inner signature, outer signature,\
    \ or both.  The syntax and\n   processing rules for security labels are described\
    \ in RFC 2634 [ESS].\n   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL',\
    \ 'SHALL NOT',\n   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL'\
    \ in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [MUSTSHOULD].\n"

  - "1.1 Information Classification Policies\n   Information is an asset, but not\
    \ all information has the same value\n   for a business.  Not all information\
    \ needs to be protected as\n   strongly as other information.\n   Research and\
    \ development plans, marketing strategies and\n   manufacturing quality specifications\
    \ developed and used by a company\n   provide competitive advantage.  This type\
    \ of information needs\n   stronger protective measures than other information,\
    \ which if\n   disclosed or modified, would cause moderate to severe damage to\
    \ the\n   company.\n   Other types of information such as internal organization\
    \ charts,\n   employee lists and policies may need little or no protective measures\n\
    \   based on value the organization places on it.\n   A corporate information\
    \ classification policy defines how its\n   information assets are to be protected.\
    \  It provides guidance to\n   employees on how to classify information assets.\
    \  It defines how to\n   label and protect an asset based on its classification\
    \ and state\n   (e.g., facsimile, electronic transfer, storage, shipping, etc.).\n"
- title: 1.2 Access Control and Security Labels
  contents:
  - "1.2 Access Control and Security Labels\n   \"Access control\" is a means of enforcing\
    \ authorizations.  There are a\n   variety of access control methods that are\
    \ based on different types\n   of policies and rely on different security mechanisms.\n\
    \   - Rule based access control is based on policies that can be\n     algorithmically\
    \ expressed.\n   - Identity based access control is based on a policy which applies\n\
    \     explicitly to an individual person or host entity, or to a defined\n   \
    \  group of such entities.  Once identity has been authenticated, if\n     the\
    \ identity is verified to be on the access list, then access is\n     granted.\n\
    \   - Rank base access control is based on a policy of hierarchical\n     positions\
    \ in an organization.  It is based on who you are in the\n     company structure.\
    \  A rank-based policy would define what\n     information that the position of\
    \ Partner or Senior Consultant could\n     access.\n   - Role based access control\
    \ is based on a policy of roles in an\n     organization.  It may or may not be\
    \ hierarchical.  It is based on\n     who you are in the company.  The role-based\
    \ policy would define\n     what information that the role of Database Administrator,\
    \ Network\n     Administrator, Mailroom Clerk or Purchaser could access.\n   Rule,\
    \ rank and role-based access control methods can rely on a\n   security label\
    \ as the security mechanism to convey the sensitivity or\n   classification of\
    \ the information.  When processing an S/MIME\n   encapsulated message, the sensitivity\
    \ information in the message's\n   security label can be compared with the recipient's\
    \ authorizations to\n   determine if the recipient is allowed to access the protected\n\
    \   content.\n   An S/MIME security label may be included as a signed attribute\
    \ in the\n   inner (or only) signature or the outer signature.  In the case of\
    \ a\n   triple-wrapped message as defined in RFC 2634, the inner signature\n \
    \  would be used for access control decisions related to the plaintext\n   original\
    \ content, while the outer signature would be used for access\n   control decisions\
    \ related to the encrypted message.\n"
- title: 1.3 User Authorizations
  contents:
  - "1.3 User Authorizations\n   Users need to be granted authorizations to access\
    \ information that\n   has been classified by an authority.  The sending and receiving\n\
    \   agents need to be able to securely determine the user's\n   authorizations\
    \ for access control processing.\n   X.509 [X.509] and the Internet profile for\
    \ X.509 certificates\n   [CERTCRL] do not define the means to represent and convey\n\
    \   authorizations in a certificate.\n   X.501 [X.501] defines how to represent\
    \ authorization in the form of a\n   clearance attribute.  The clearance attribute\
    \ identifies the security\n   policy in force to which a list of possible classifications\
    \ and\n   security categories relates.\n   X.501 also notes two means for binding\
    \ the clearance to a named\n   entity: an Attribute Certificate and a Certificate\
    \ extension field\n   (e.g., within the subjectDirectoryAttribute extension).\n\
    \   RFC 3281 [AC509] defines a profile of X.509 Attribute Certificate\n   (AC)\
    \ suitable for use with authorization information within Internet\n   Protocols.\
    \  One of the defined attributes is Clearance, which carries\n   clearance (security\
    \ labeling) information about the AC owner.  The\n   syntax for Clearance is imported\
    \ from X.501.\n"

    \ to assess the availability requirements of\n   data, applications and systems.\
    \  A business decision will be required\n   to determine the length of unavailability\
    \ that can be tolerated prior\n   to expending additional resources to ensure\

  contents:
  - "2.2.4 Additional ESSSecurityLabel Processing Guidance\n   An implementation issue\
    \ can be the mapping of the security label\n   values to displayable characters.\
    \  This is an issue for users who\n   want to develop and retire their own classifications\
    \ and categories\n   on a regular basis and when the values are encoded in non-human\n\
    \   readable form.  Applications should provide a means for the\n   enterprise\
    \ to manage these changes.  The practice of hard coding the\n   mapping into the\
    \ applications is discouraged.\n   This issue is viewed as local issue for the\
    \ application vendor, as\n   the solution does not need to be interoperable between\
    \ vendors.\n   An approach is the use of a Security Policy Information File (SPIF)\n\
    \   [ISO15816].  A SPIF is a construct that conveys domain-specific\n   security\
    \ policy information.  It is a signed object to protect it\n   from unauthorized\
    \ changes and to authenticate the source of the\n   policy information.  It contains\
    \ critical display information such as\n   the text string for security classifications\
    \ and security categories\n   to be displayed to the user, as well as additional\
    \ security policy\n   information.\n   Another implementation issue can be obtaining\
    \ the recipient's\n   certificate when sending a signed-only message with a security\
    \ label.\n   Normally the recipient's certificate is only needed when sending\
    \ an\n   encrypted message.  Applications will need to be able to retrieve the\n\
    \   recipient's certificate so that the recipient's clearance information\n  \
    \ is available for the access control check.\n"
