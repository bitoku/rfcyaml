  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system assigns unique\
    \ identifiers\n   to digital documents that can be queried and managed in a consistent\n\
    \   fashion.  The structure of DOIs is defined by ISO 26324:2012\n   [ISO-DOI]\
    \ and is implemented by a group of registration agencies\n   coordinated by the\
    \ International DOI Foundation.\n   Each DOI is associated with bibliographic\
    \ metadata about the object,\n   including one or more URIs where the object can\
    \ be found.  The\n   metadata is stored in a public database with entries retrieved\
    \ via\n   HTTP.\n   DOIs are widely used by publishers and consumers of technical\n\
    \   journals and other technical material published online.\n   Page 15 of [CITABILITY]\
    \ indicates that (note that citations have been\n   omitted):\n      Typical web\
    \ addresses are unreliable for locating online\n      resources, because they\
    \ can move, change or disappear entirely.\n      But persistent identifiers are\
    \ fixed, with an infrastructure that\n      allows for the location of the item\
    \ to be updated.  The result is\n      that the identifier can provide persistent\
    \ access to the data.\n      DataCite provides such a service, and DOIs (used\
    \ by DataCite) were\n      by far the identifier most commonly mentioned by interviewees,\n\
    \      closely followed by Handles (on which the DOI system is built).\n     \
    \ There was a keen preference for DOIs from interviewees because\n      this is\
    \ a system already used and understood by publishers for\n      traditional publications\
    \ and so the barrier to uptake would\n      presumably be lower than for an entirely\
    \ novel system.\n   Some scholarly publishers accept DOIs as references in published\n\
    \   documents, and some versions of BibTeX can automatically retrieve the\n  \
    \ bibliographic data for a DOI and format it.  DOIs may have other\n   advantages,\
    \ such as making it easier to find the free online versions\n   of RFCs rather\
    \ than paywalled copies when following references or\n   using some document indexes.\n\
    \   The benefits of DOIs apply equally to documents from all of the RFC\n   submission\
    \ streams, so all RFCs are assigned DOIs.\n"
- title: 2.  Structure and Resolution of DOIs
  contents:
  - "2.  Structure and Resolution of DOIs\n   DOIs are an application of the Handle\
    \ System defined by RFCs\n   [RFC3650], [RFC3651], and [RFC3652].  For example,\
    \ a DOI for an RFC\n   might be as follows:\n      10.17487/rfc1149\n   The first\
    \ part of a DOI is the number 10, which means a DOI within\n   the Handle System,\
    \ followed by a dot and a unique number assigned to\n   a publisher, in this case\
    \ 17487.  This part is the DOI prefix.\n   Following that is a slash and a text\
    \ string assigned by the\n   publisher, called the DOI suffix.\n   DOIs are treated\
    \ as opaque identifiers.  The DOI suffixes assigned to\n   RFCs are currently\
    \ based on the \"doc-id\" field of the RFC index in\n   XML (rfc-index.xml), but\
    \ the suffix of future RFCs might be based on\n   something else if circumstances\
    \ change.  Hence, the reliable way to\n   find the DOI for an RFC is not to guess,\
    \ but to look it up in the RFC\n   index or on the RFC Editor website <https://www.rfc-editor.org/>.\n\
    \   RFC references created from entries in the usual bibxml libraries\n   will\
    \ have DOIs included automatically.\n   Although the Handle System has its own\
    \ protocol described in\n   [RFC3652], the usual way to look up a DOI is to use\
    \ web lookup.  A\n   proposed \"doi:\" URN was never widely implemented, so the\
    \ standard way\n   to look up a DOI is to use the public HTTP proxy at\n   <https://dx.doi.org>.\
    \  The example DOI above could be looked up at:\n      https://dx.doi.org/10.17487/rfc1149\n\
    \   Whenever a publisher assigns a DOI, it provides the bibliographic\n   metadata\
    \ for the object (henceforth called a document, since that is\n   what they are\
    \ in this context) to its registration agency that then\n   makes it available\
    \ to clients that look up DOIs.  The document's\n   metadata is typically uploaded\
    \ to the registration agency in XML\n   using an HTTP-based API.  Users or publishing\
    \ software can retrieve\n   the metadata by fetching the DOI's URL and using standard\
    \ HTTP\n   content negotiation to request application/citeproc+json,\n   application/rdf+xml,\
    \ or other bibliographic formats.\n   Publishers have considerable flexibility\
    \ as to what resides at the\n   URI(s) to which a DOI refers.  Sometimes it's\
    \ the document itself,\n   while for commercial publishers it's typically a page\
    \ with the\n   abstract, bibliographic information, and some way to buy the actual\n\
    \   document.  Because some RFCs are in multiple formats (e.g.,\n   Postscript\
    \ and text), an appropriate URI is that of the RFC Editor's\n   info page that\
    \ has the document's abstract and links to the\n   document(s) in various formats.\
    \  Hence, the URI above, when fetched\n   via an HTTP request that accepts text/html,\
    \ redirects to:\n      https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc1149\n   More information\
    \ on the structure and use of DOIs is in the DOI\n   Handbook [DOI-HB].\n"
- title: 3.  DOIs for RFCs
  contents:
  - "3.  DOIs for RFCs\n   With DOIs assigned to each RFC, it is useful to include\
    \ DOI\n   information in the XML bibliography as a \"seriesInfo\" item, so that\n\
    \   rendering engines can display it if desired.  Online databases and\n   indexes\
    \ that include RFCs should be updated to include the DOI, e.g.,\n   the ACM Digital\
    \ Library.  (A practical advantage of this is that the\n   DOI would link directly\
    \ to the RFC Editor, rather than perhaps to a\n   copy of an RFC behind a paywall.)\n\
    \   Since RFCs are immutable, existing RFCs still don't mention their own\n  \
    \ DOIs within the RFCs themselves, but putting their DOIs into indexes\n   would\
    \ provide value.\n"
- title: 4.  The Process of Assigning DOIs
  contents:
  - "4.  The Process of Assigning DOIs\n   There are three phases to assigning DOIs\
    \ to RFCs: getting a DOI\n   prefix, retroactively assigning DOIs to existing\
    \ documents, and\n   updating the publication process to assign DOIs as new RFCs\
    \ are\n   published.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Getting a DOI Prefix
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Getting a DOI Prefix\n   There are ten registration agencies [DOI-RA] that\
    \ assign DOI\n   prefixes.  Most of them serve specialized audiences or limited\n\
    \   geographic areas, but there are a few that handle scholarly and\n   technical\
    \ materials.  All registration agencies charge for DOIs to\n   defray the cost\
    \ of maintaining the metadata databases.\n   The RFC Editor chose CrossRef, an\
    \ agency widely used by journal\n   publishers.  The prices associated with CrossRef\
    \ membership are on\n   the order of $660.00 per year for membership, deposit\
    \ fees of $0.15\n   cents per document for a bulk upload of the backfile (the\
    \ existing\n   RFCs), and $1.00 per document to deposit them as they are published.\n\
    \   The RFC Editor's DOI prefix is 10.17487.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Retroactively Assigning DOIs
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Retroactively Assigning DOIs\n   Other than paying the deposit fees, assigning\
    \ DOIs to all of the\n   existing RFCs was primarily a software problem.  The\
    \ RFC Production\n   Center's internal database was updated to include a DOI field\
    \ for\n   each RFC, the schema for rfc-index.xml was updated to include a DOI\n\
    \   field, and the scripts that create the XML and text indexes were\n   updated\
    \ to include the DOI for each RFC.  A specialized DOI\n   submission script extracted\
    \ the metadata for all of the RFCs from the\n   XML index and submitted it to\
    \ the registration agency using the\n   agency's online API.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Assigning DOIs to New RFCs
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Assigning DOIs to New RFCs\n   As RFCs are published, the publication software\
    \ assigns a DOI to each\n   new RFC.  The submission script extracts the metadata\
    \ for new RFCs\n   from the XML index and submits the information for new RFCs\
    \ to the\n   registration agency.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Use of DOIs in RFCs
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Use of DOIs in RFCs\n   The DOI agency requests that documents that are\
    \ assigned DOIs in turn\n   include DOIs when possible when referring to other\
    \ organizations'\n   documents.  DOIs can be listed using the existing seriesInfo\
    \ field in\n   the xml2rfc reference entity, and authors are requested provide\
    \ DOIs\n   for non-RFC documents when possible.  The RFC Production Center might\n\
    \   add missing DOIs when it's easy to do so, e.g., when the same\n   reference\
    \ with a DOI has appeared in a prior RFC, or a quick online\n   search finds the\
    \ DOI.  Where the citation libraries include DOIs, the\n   output (references\
    \ created from those citation libraries) will\n   include DOIs.\n   The RFC Style\
    \ Guide [RFC-STYLE] has been updated to describe the\n   rules for including DOIs\
    \ in the References sections of RFCs.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Possible Future Work
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Possible Future Work\n   Since it is usually possible to retrieve the bibliographic\n\
    \   information for a document from its DOI (as BibTeX can do, described\n   above),\
    \ it might also be worth adding this feature to xml2rfc, so a\n   reference with\
    \ only a DOI could be automatically fetched and\n   expanded.\n"
- title: 5.  Internationalization
  contents:
  - "5.  Internationalization\n   Adding DOIs presents no new internationalization\
    \ issues.\n   Since DOIs are opaque, the characters used in any particular DOI\
    \ are\n   unimportant beyond ensuring that they can be represented where\n   needed.\
    \  The Handle System says they are UTF-8-encoded Unicode, but\n   in practice\
    \ all DOIs appear to use only printable ASCII characters.\n   The metadata for\
    \ each RFC is uploaded as UTF-8-encoded XML.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The DOI system adds a new way to locate RFCs\
    \ and a bibliographic\n   database containing a description of each RFC.  The\
    \ existing\n   locations and bibliographic info are essentially unchanged, so\
    \ there\n   is no new dependency on the DOI system.\n   Were CrossRef or the DOI\
    \ database to suffer a security breach, it is\n   hypothetically possible that\
    \ users would be directed to locations\n   other than the RFC Editor's web site\
    \ or would retrieve incorrect\n   bibliographic data, but the actual RFCs would\
    \ remain intact.\n"
