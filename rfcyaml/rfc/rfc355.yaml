    \  John Davidson\n                              June 9, 1972\n   remote interactive\
    \ systems.  Since the University of Hawaii will, by\n   the end of this year,\
    \ be linked to the ARPANET via satellite, the\n   consequences of such delays\
    \ are perhaps of more immediate concern to\n   us than to current members of the\
    \ surface net.  Consequently the BCC\n   500 research group here has been studying\
    \ various solutions to the\n   problems of buffer allocation, partitioned echoing,\
    \ etc. re-introduced\n   in RFC 346.\n        Generally, the solutions come from\
    \ extensions to the original\n   design concepts of the BCC 500 distributed communication\
    \ system.  The\n   500 was designed to serve a large number of geographically-scattered\n\
    \   users each of whom accessed the central computing facility through one\n \
    \  of several remote concentrators.  [The concept is not too unlike that\n   of\
    \ users at different TIPs all accessing a single host.] Since it was\n   felt\
    \ that in full-duplex, character-by-character interaction, echo\n   delays of\
    \ any noticeable length should not be tolerated, a facility\n   was provide whereby\
    \ the concentrator could provide local (to the\n   terminal) echoing when deemed\
    \ appropriate.  (A character input/output\n   microprocessor, the CHIO, in implicit\
    \ conjunction with the terminal\n   user's process executing in the CPU dictated\
    \ when it was appropriate.)\n   The problems associated with coordinating the\
    \ concentrator and CHIO in\n   the partioning of echoing were solved for the BCC\
    \ 500, but are not\n   immediately extensible to the asynchronous message transmissions\
    \ of\n   the ARPANET - especially with the introduction of satellite delays.\n\
    \   As stated, we are working on some viable alternatives.\n        It is not\
    \ known, at present, what effects the incorporation of\n   these partitioned echoing\
    \ techniques might have on the existing net.\n   Perhaps local echoing will become\
    \ a function of User TELNETs; most\n   certainly local echoing should be available\
    \ in the TIP.  But could it\n   be incorporated into the IMP so that TIP and User\
    \ TELNETs can be used\n   without change?  If so, what happens to the concentrator's\
    \ local\n   echoing capability in a system such as the BCC 500?\n        These\
    \ questions do not have immediate answers.  Other problems\n   obviously exist\
    \ because of the differences in serving system\n   conventions for terminal control.\
    \  We, in conjunction with the ILLIAC\n   group at NASA-AMES, are seeking solutions\
    \ to such problems in general,\n   with an eye toward their implementation\n \
    \  our group with any interested parties.\n         [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp.\
    \ under the   ]\n         [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                      1/97\
    \ ]\n"
