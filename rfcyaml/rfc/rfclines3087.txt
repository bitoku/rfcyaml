Abstract This memo provides information for the Internet community.
It describes a useful way to conceptualize the use of the standard SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
Request URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
that the authors and many members of the SIP community think is suitable as a convention.
It does not define any new protocol with respect to RFC 2543.
In a conventional telephony environment, extended service applications often use call state information, such as calling party, called party, reason for forward, etc, to infer application context.
In a SIP/2.0 call, much of this information may be either non  existent or unreliable.
This document proposes a mechanism to communicate context information to an application.
Under this proposal, a client or proxy can communicate context through the use of a distinctive Request URI.
This document continues with examples of how this mechanism could be used in a voice mail application.
Introduction A communication service should make use of the information it has at hand when being accessed.
For example, in most current voice mail implementations, a subscriber retrieving messages from his own desk does not have to reenter his voice mailbox number
the service assumes that the store being accessed is the one associated with the endpoint being used to access the service.
Some services allow the user to validate this assumption using IVR techniques before prompting for a PIN.
This concept of context awareness can be captured in a voice mail service implementing SIP as defined in RFC 2543[1], without modification, through the standard use of that protocol's Request  URI.
Furthermore, the concept is applicable to any SIP based service where initial application state should be determined from context.
This concept is a usage convention of standard SIP as defined in RFC 2543[1] and does not modify or extend that protocol in any way.
In this document, we use the example of voice mail to illustrate the technique.
One motivation for applying this technique to this problem is allowing a proxy or location server to control the initial state of a voice service.
For example, a voice client might register a contact list ending with the URL that would accept voice messages for the client.
2.1 Using URIs to Control
Many conventional voice mail systems use call state information, such as the calling party, called party, reason for forward, etc, to decide the initial application state.
For example, it might play one outgoing message if the call reached voice mail because the called party did not answer and another if the line was busy.
It decides whom the message is for based on the called party information.
If the call originated from a subscriber's phone number, it might authenticate the caller and then go directly to the message retrieval and account maintenance menu.
When a new subscriber is added to a system, a set of identities could be generated, each given a unique sip URI.
The following tables show some of the identities that might be generated (it is not exhaustive).
The example schemes show that the URIs could, but don't necessarily have to, have mnemonic value.
In practical applications, it is important that an application does not apply semantic rules to the various URIs.
Instead, it should allow any arbitrary string to be provisioned, and map the string to the desired behavior.
The owner of the system may choose to provision mnemonic strings, but the application should not require it.
In any large installation, the system owner is likely to have pre existing rules for mnemonic URIs, and any attempt by an application to define its own rules may create a conflict.
For our example, this means a voice mail system should allow an arbitrary mix of URLs from these schemes, or any other scheme that renders valid SIP URIs to be provisioned, rather than enforce one particular scheme.
rjs@vm.wcom.com;mode deposit Deposit with on    sip:
rjs@vm.wcom.com;mode retrieve Retrieve prompt  sip:
sub rjs retrieve inpin.vm.wcom.com for PIN
rjs@vm.wcom.com;mode inpin When a service is first set up,
identities such as the following could be created.
deposit@vm.wcom.com;mode inband Retrieve prompt  sip:
In addition to providing this set of URIs to the subscriber (to use as he sees fit), an integrated service provider could add these to the set of contacts in a find me proxy.
The proxy could then route calls to the appropriate URI based on the origin of the request, the subscriber's preferences and current state.
In each of these scenarios, the PSTN gateway is configured to communicate only with a particular proxy registrar.
3.1 Deposits 3.1.1 Direct Request to Deposit to a particular mailbox 3.1.1.1 SIP source A SIP client that knew the URI for a particular deposit mailbox (sip:
sub rjs deposit@vm.wcom.com) could place a direct invitation to the voicemail service, or through a protecting proxy.
The proxy could restrict access to deposit identities with special greetings by authenticating the requester.
The gateway's proxy would map a call from an unrecognized PSTN number to a number associated with a subscriber's mailbox into an invite to the deposit with standard greeting URI (sip:
The gateway's proxy would map a call from a recognized (exact or pattern match)
PSTN number to a number associated with a subscriber's mailbox into an invite to the appropriate special greeting URI
The gateway's ability to identify the calling party (using calling party number) is trusted, so no further authentication of the requester is performed.
3.1.2 Direct Request to Deposit, mailbox to be determined 3.1.2.1 SIP source A voice mail service or its protecting proxy could expose a generic deposit URL for use when a caller wished to go directly to voice mail.
The service would likely play an IVR dialog to determine what message store to deposit a message into.
An application designer may be tempted to attempt to match the To: and From: headers on a call to infer information.
However, this approach could cause complications when multiple proxy forwards occur in a call.
For example, A calls B, who has all calls forwarded to C. C forwards the call to her voice mail service.
If the voice mail service matches the To: header to determine the message store, it will get the information for B instead of C.
But there is no reason to assume that C's voice mail service has any knowledge of B. 3.1.2.2 PSTN source The gateway's proxy would map a call from an unrecognized PSTN number to the top level voice mail service access number to an invite to the Deposit prompt for target mailbox in band URI
Getting the call to the target mailbox would proceed as in the SIP source case.
3.1.2.3 Indirect Request to Deposit, due to find me proxy decision
A find me proxy could map an invitation to a subscriber (sip:rjs@wcom.com) to the appropriate voice mail service URI depending on the subscriber's current state.
The normal deposit URI could be chosen if the subscriber's contact list has been otherwise exhausted with no answer.
The busy announcement URI would be chosen when a busy everywhere response is received from one of the contacts.
A DND announcement URI could be selected if the subscriber had activated DND.
Calls to sip:receptionist@wcom.com could be configured to roll to sip:deposit@wcom.com 3.2 Retrievals 3.2.1 Request to Retrieve from a particular mailbox 3.2.1.1 Trusted SIP source
A request to retrieve the contents of a particular mailbox (sip:sub  rjs retrieve@vm.wcom.com) coming from a trusted source could be honored without further authentication checks.
A trusted source is one with which the voice mail service has secure communications, and to which it is willing to delegate authentication.
This could be the service's protecting proxy for example.
3.2.1.2 Authenticated SIP source A service, or its protecting proxy, could choose to honor a retrieve request for a particular mailbox (sip:
If SIP level authentication failed, the service or proxy could be configured to send the call to the in band pin prompting URI
3.2.1.3 Unauthenticated SIP source A service, or its protecting proxy, receiving a retrieve request for a particular mailbox
with no other method of authenticating the requestor could send the request to the in band pin prompting URI (sip:sub rjs retrieve inpin@vm.wcom.com).
This scenario assumes that the service provider's network has been configured such that a PSTN number could be dialed explicitly for retrieving messages from a particular mailbox.
Such services currently exist, but are not common.
In such a network, the gateway's proxy would map the call to the in band pin prompting URI
3.2.2 Request to Retrieve, mailbox to be determined 3.2.2.1 SIP source As in the Request to Deposit scenario, when a service receives a request for the top level retrieve URI
it would most likely need to use in band IVR techniques to determine the target mailbox and authenticate the caller.
This scenario assumes there is a single PSTN number that subscribers dial to access the voice mail service to retrieve messages.
This is the most common access method provided by current voice mail services.
The gateway's proxy would map a call to the top level PSTN number to the top level retrieve in band prompting URI (sip:retrieve  in@vm.wcom.com).
Once the system identifies the target mailbox, the call would be transferred to the appropriate in band pin prompting URI (sip:sub rjs retrieve inpin@vm.wcom.com).
3.2.2.3 Recognized PSTN source This scenario also assumes there is a single PSTN number that subscribers dial to access the voice mail service to retrieve messages.
The gateway's proxy would recognize the calling party number as a subscriber, and map the call to the subscriber's in band prompting URI (sip:sub rjs retrieve inpin@vm.wcom.com) 4.
Voice Mail Call Flow Examples
The following section describes some example call flows for a hypothetical voice mail service, with the host name of vm.wcom.com.
All the call flows assume that a proxy protects the voice mail service and that a trust relationship exists between the voice mail service and the proxy.
4.1 Generic Scenario 4.1.1 Direct call to the voice mail system
User A calls the voice mail system directly.
The voice mail system invokes the top level menu, which might prompt the caller for an extension or the first few letters of a name.
