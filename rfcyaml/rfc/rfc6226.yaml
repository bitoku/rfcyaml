  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multiple mechanisms exist today to create and distribute
    Group-to-RP\n   mappings.  Each PIM-SM router may learn Group-to-RP mappings through\n
    \  various mechanisms, as described in Section 4.\n   It is critical that each
    router select the same 'RP' for a specific\n   multicast group address; otherwise,
    full multicast connectivity will\n   not be established.  This is true even when
    using an Anycast RP to\n   provide redundancy.  This RP address may correspond
    to a different\n   physical router, but it is one logical RP address and must
    be\n   consistent across the PIM domain.  This is usually achieved by using\n
    \  the same algorithm to select the RP in all the PIM routers in a\n   domain.\n
    \  PIM-SM [RFC4601] has defined an algorithm to select a 'RP' for a\n   given
    multicast group address, but it is not flexible enough for an\n   administrator
    to apply various policies.  Please refer to Section 3\n   for more details.\n
    \  The PIM-STD-MIB [RFC5060] includes a number of objects to allow an\n   administrator
    to set the precedence for Group-to-RP mappings that are\n   learned statically
    or dynamically and stored in the\n   'pimGroupMappingTable'.  The Management Information
    Base (MIB) module\n   also defines an algorithm that can be applied to the data
    contained\n   in the 'pimGroupMappingTable' to determine Group-to-RP mappings.\n
    \  However, this algorithm is not completely deterministic, because it\n   includes
    an implementation-specific 'precedence' value.\n   Network management stations
    will be able to deduce which RPs will be\n   selected by applying the algorithm
    from this document to the list of\n   Group-to-RP mappings from the 'pimGroupMappingTable'.
    \ The algorithm\n   provides MIB visibility into how routers will apply Group-to-RP\n
    \  mappings and also fixes the inconsistency introduced by the way that\n   different
    vendors implement the selection of the Group-to-RP mappings\n   to create multicast
    forwarding state.\n   Embedded-RP, as defined in Section 7.1 of \"Embedding the
    Rendezvous\n   Point (RP) Address in an IPv6 Multicast Address\" [RFC3956], specifies\n
    \  the following: \"To avoid loops and inconsistencies, for addresses in\n   the
    range ff70::/12, the Embedded-RP mapping MUST be considered the\n   longest possible
    match and higher priority than any other mechanism\".\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n
    \  This document also uses the following terms:\n   o  PIM Mode\n      PIM Mode
    is the mode of operation for which a particular multicast\n      group is used.
    \ Wherever this term is used in this document, it\n      refers to either Sparse
    Mode or Bidirectional (BIDIR) Mode.\n   o  Dynamic Group-to-RP Mapping Mechanisms\n
    \     The term \"dynamic Group-to-RP mapping mechanisms\" in this document\n      refers
    to Bootstrap Router (BSR) [RFC5059] and Auto-RP.\n   o  Dynamic Mappings and Dynamically
    Learned Mappings\n      The terms \"dynamic mappings\" and \"dynamically learned
    mappings\"\n      refer to Group-to-RP mappings that have been learned by either
    BSR\n      or Auto-RP.  Group-to-RP mappings that have been learned by\n      Embedded-RP
    are referred to as Embedded Group-to-RP mappings.\n   o  Filtering\n      Filtering
    is the selective discarding of dynamic Group-to-RP\n      mapping information,
    based on the group address, the type of\n      Group-to-RP mapping message, and
    the interface on which the\n      mapping message was received.\n   o  Multicast
    Domain and Boundaries\n      The term \"multicast domain\" used in this document
    refers to a\n      network topology that has a consistent set of Group-to-RP\n
    \     mappings.  The interface between two or more multicast domains is\n      a
    multicast domain boundary.  The multicast boundaries are usually\n      enforced
    by filtering the dynamic mapping messages and/or\n      configuring different
    static RP mappings.\n"

  - "3.  Existing Algorithm\n   The existing algorithm defined in PIM-SM (Section
    4.7.1 of [RFC4601])\n   does not consider the following constraints:\n   o  It
    does not consider the origin of a Group-to-RP mapping and\n      therefore will
    treat all of them equally.\n   o  It does not provide the flexibility to give
    higher priority to a\n      specific PIM mode.  For example, an entry learned
    for the PIM-\n      BIDIR Mode is treated with the same priority as an entry learned\n
    \     for PIM-SM.\n   The algorithm defined in this document updates the algorithm
    defined\n   in PIM-SM (Section 4.7.1 of [RFC4601]).  The new algorithm is\n   backward
    compatible and will produce the same result only if the\n   Group-to-RP mappings
    are learned from a single mapping source.  The\n   full benefits of the new algorithm
    will not be realized until it is\n   widely deployed.\n"
  title: 3.  Existing Algorithm
- contents:
  - "4.  Assumptions\n   We have made the following assumptions in defining this algorithm:\n
    \  o  A Group-to-RP mapping can be learned from various mechanisms.  We\n      assume
    that the following list is ordered by decreasing preference\n      for these mechanisms:\n
    \     *  Embedded Group-to-RP mappings\n      *  Dynamically learned mappings\n
    \     *  Static configuration\n      *  Other mapping method\n   o  Embedded Group-to-RP
    mappings are special and always have the\n      highest priority.  They cannot
    be overridden by static\n      configuration or by dynamic Group-to-RP mappings.\n
    \  o  Dynamic mappings will override a static RP configuration if they\n      have
    overlapping ranges.  However, it is possible to override\n      dynamic Group-to-RP
    mappings with static configurations, either by\n      filtering, or by configuring
    longer static group addresses that\n      override dynamic mappings when longest
    prefix matching is applied.\n   o  A Group-to-RP mapping learned for PIM-BIDIR
    Mode is preferred to\n      an entry learned for PIM-SM Mode as stipulated in
    Section 3.3 of\n      [RFC5059].\n   o  Dynamic Group-to-RP mapping mechanisms
    are filtered at domain\n      boundaries or for policy enforcement inside a domain.\n"
  title: 4.  Assumptions
- contents:
  - "5.  Common Use Cases\n   A network operator deploying IP Multicast will require
    a\n   deterministic way to select the precedence for Group-to-RP mappings\n   in
    the following use cases:\n   o  Default static Group-to-RP mappings with dynamically
    learned\n      entries\n      Many network operators will have a dedicated infrastructure
    for\n      the standard multicast group range (224/4) and so might be using\n
    \     statically configured Group-to-RP mappings for this range.  In\n      this
    case, to support some specific applications, they might want\n      to learn Group-to-RP
    mappings dynamically using either the BSR or\n      Auto-RP mechanism.  In this
    case, to select Group-to-RP mappings\n      for these specific applications, a
    longer prefix match should be\n      given preference over statically configured
    Group-to-RP mappings.\n      For example, 239.100.0.0/16, an administratively
    scoped multicast\n      address range, could be learned for a corporate communications\n
    \     application.  Network operators may change the Group-to-RP\n      mappings
    for these applications more often, and the mappings would\n      need to be learned
    dynamically.  This is not an issue for IPv6\n      Multicast address ranges.\n
    \  o  Migration situations\n      Network operators occasionally go through a
    migration due to an\n      acquisition or a change in their network design.  In
    order to\n      facilitate this migration, there is a need to have a deterministic\n
    \     behavior of Group-to-RP mapping selection for entries learned\n      using
    the BSR and Auto-RP mechanisms.  This will help in avoiding\n      any unforeseen
    interoperability issues between different vendors'\n      network elements.\n
    \  o  Use by management systems\n      A network management station can determine
    the RP for a specific\n      group in a specific router by running this algorithm
    on the Group-\n      to-RP mapping table fetched using MIB objects.\n"
  title: 5.  Common Use Cases
- contents:
  - "6.  Proposed Algorithm\n   The following algorithm deterministically chooses
    between several\n   Group-to-RP mappings for a specific group.  It also addresses
    the\n   above-mentioned shortcomings in the existing mechanism.\n   1.   If the
    multicast group address being looked up contains an\n        embedded RP, the
    RP address extracted from the group address is\n        selected as the Group-to-RP
    mapping.\n   2.   If the multicast group address being looked up is in the Source\n
    \       Specific Multicast (SSM) range or is configured for Dense Mode,\n        no
    Group-to-RP mapping is selected, and this algorithm\n        terminates.  The
    fact that no Group-to-RP mapping has been\n        selected can be represented
    in the PIM-STD-MIB module [RFC5060]\n        by setting the address type of the
    RP to 'unknown', as described\n        in Section 8.\n   3.   From the set of
    all Group-to-RP mapping entries, the subset\n        whose group prefix contains
    the multicast group that is being\n        looked up is selected.\n   4.   If
    there are no entries available, then the Group-to-RP mapping\n        is undefined,
    and this algorithm terminates.\n   5.   A longest prefix match is performed on
    the subset of Group-to-RP\n        mappings.\n        *  If there is only one
    entry available, then that entry is\n           selected as the Group-to-RP mapping.\n
    \       *  If there are multiple entries available, the algorithm\n           continues
    with this smaller set of Group-to-RP mappings.\n   6.   From the remaining set
    of Group-to-RP mappings, we select the\n        subset of entries based on the
    preference for the PIM modes to\n        which the multicast group addresses are
    assigned.  A Group-to-RP\n        mapping entry with PIM Mode 'BIDIR' will be
    preferred to an\n        entry with PIM Mode 'PIM-SM'.\n        *  If there is
    only one entry available, then that entry is\n           selected as the Group-to-RP
    mapping.\n        *  If there are multiple entries available, the algorithm\n
    \          continues with this smaller set of Group-to-RP mappings.\n   7.   From
    the remaining set of Group-to-RP mappings, we select the\n        subset of the
    entries based on the origin.  Group-to-RP mappings\n        learned dynamically
    are preferred over static mappings.  If the\n        remaining dynamic Group-to-RP
    mappings are from BSR and Auto-RP,\n        then the mappings from BSR are preferred.\n
    \       *  If there is only one entry available, then that entry is\n           selected
    as the Group-to-RP mapping.\n        *  If there are multiple entries available,
    the algorithm\n           continues with this smaller set of Group-to-RP mappings.\n
    \  8.   If the remaining Group-to-RP mappings were learned through BSR,\n        then
    the RP will be selected by comparing the RP Priority values\n        in the Candidate-RP-Advertisement
    messages.  The RP mapping with\n        the lowest value indicates the highest
    priority [RFC5059].\n        *  If more than one RP has the same highest priority
    (i.e., the\n           same lowest value), the algorithm continues with those
    Group-\n           to-RP mappings.\n        *  If the remaining Group-to-RP mappings
    were NOT learned from\n           BSR, the algorithm continues with the next step.\n
    \  9.   If the remaining Group-to-RP mappings were learned through BSR\n        and
    the PIM Mode of the group is 'PIM-SM', then the hash\n        function as defined
    in Section 4.7.2 of [RFC4601] will be used\n        to choose the RP.  The RP
    with the highest resulting hash value\n        will be selected.  Please see Section
    10 for consideration of\n        hash for BIDIR-PIM and BSR.\n        *  If more
    than one RP has the same highest hash value, the\n           algorithm continues
    with those Group-to-RP mappings.\n        *  If the remaining Group-to-RP mappings
    were NOT learned from\n           BSR, the algorithm continues with the next step.\n
    \  10.  From the remaining set of Group-to-RP mappings, the RP with the\n        highest
    IP address (numerically greater) will be selected.  This\n        will serve as
    a final tiebreaker.\n"

  - "7.  Interpretation of MIB Objects\n   As described in [RFC5060], the Group-to-RP
    mapping information is\n   summarized in the pimGroupMappingTable.  The precedence
    value is\n   stored in the 'pimGroupMappingPrecedence' object, which covers both\n
    \  the dynamically learned Group-to-RP mapping information and the\n   static
    configuration.  For static configurations, the\n   'pimGroupMappingPrecedence'
    object uses the value of the\n   'pimStaticRPPrecedence' object from the pimStaticRPTable.\n
    \  The algorithm defined in this document does not use the concept of\n   precedence,
    and therefore the values configured in the\n   'pimGroupMappingPrecedence' and
    'pimStaticRPPrecedence' objects in\n   the PIM-STD-MIB module [RFC5060] are not
    applicable to the new\n   algorithm.  The objects still retain their meaning for
    'legacy'\n   implementations, but since the algorithm defined in this document
    is\n   to be used in preference to those found in PIM-SM [RFC4601] and the\n   PIM-STD-MIB
    [RFC5060], the values of these objects will be ignored on\n   implementations
    that support the new algorithm.\n"

  - "8.  Clarification for MIB Objects\n   An implementation of this specification
    can continue to be managed\n   using the PIM-STD-MIB [RFC5060].  Group-to-RP mapping
    entries are\n   created in the pimGroupMappingTable for group ranges that are
    SSM or\n   Dense mode.  In these cases, the pimGroupMappingRPAddressType object\n
    \  is set to unknown(0), and the PIM Mode in the pimGroupMappingPimMode\n   object
    is set to either ssm(2) or dm(5) to reflect the type of the\n   group range.\n
    \  Also, all the entries that are already included in the SSM Range\n   table
    in the IP Multicast MIB [RFC5132] are copied to the\n   pimGroupMappingTable.
    \ Such entries have their type in the\n   pimGroupMappingOrigin object set to
    configSsm(3) and the RP address\n   type in the pimGroupMappingRPAddressType object
    set to unknown(0), as\n   described above.\n"

  - "9.  Use of Dynamic Group-to-RP Mapping Protocols\n   It is not usually necessary
    to run several dynamic Group-to-RP\n   mapping mechanisms in one administrative
    domain.  Specifically,\n   interoperation of BSR and Auto-RP is OPTIONAL.\n   However,
    if a router does receive two overlapping sets of Group-to-RP\n   mappings, for
    example from Auto-RP and BSR, then some algorithm is\n   needed to deterministically
    resolve the situation.  The algorithm in\n   this document MUST be used on all
    routers in the domain.  This can be\n   important at domain border routers, and
    is likely to avoid conflicts\n   caused by misconfiguration (when routers receive
    overlapping sets of\n   Group-to-RP mappings) and when configuration is changing.\n
    \  An implementation of PIM that supports only one mechanism for\n   learning
    Group-to-RP mappings MUST also use this algorithm.  The\n   algorithm has been
    chosen so that existing standard implementations\n   are already compliant.\n"

  - "10.  Considerations for Bidirectional-PIM and BSR Hash\n   BIDIR-PIM [RFC5015]
    is designed to avoid any data-driven events.\n   This is especially true in the
    case of a source-only branch.  The RP\n   mapping is determined based on a group
    mask when the mapping is\n   received through a dynamic mapping protocol or statically
    configured.\n   Therefore, based on the algorithm defined in this document, the
    hash\n   in BSR is ignored for PIM-BIDIR RP mappings.  It is RECOMMENDED that\n
    \  network operators configure only one PIM-BIDIR RP for each RP\n   Priority.\n"

  - "11.  Filtering Group-to-RP Mappings at Domain Boundaries\n   An implementation
    of PIM SHOULD support configuration to filter\n   specific dynamic mechanisms
    for a valid group prefix range.  For\n   example, it should be possible to allow
    an administratively scoped\n   address range, such as 239/8, for the Auto-RP protocol,
    but to filter\n   out the BSR advertisement for the same range.  Similarly, it
    should\n   be possible to filter out all Group-to-RP mappings learned from BSR\n
    \  or the Auto-RP protocol.\n"

  - "12.  Security Considerations\n   This document enhances an existing algorithm
    to deterministically\n   choose between several Group-to-RP mappings for a specific
    group.\n   Different routers may select a different Group-to-RP mapping for the\n
    \  same group if the Group-to-RP mappings learned in these routers are\n   not
    consistent.  For example, let us assume that BSR is not enabled\n   in one of
    the routers, and so it does not learn any Group-to-RP\n   mappings from BSR.  Now
    the Group-to-RP mappings learned in this\n   router may not be consistent with
    other routers in the network; it\n   may select a different RP or may not select
    any RP for a given group.\n   Such situations can be avoided if the mechanisms
    used to learn Group-\n   to-RP mappings are secure and consistent across the network.
    \ Secure\n   transport of the mapping protocols can be accomplished by using\n
    \  authentication with IPsec, as described in Section 6.3 of [RFC4601].\n"
