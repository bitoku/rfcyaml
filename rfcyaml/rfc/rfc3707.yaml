- title: 1.1.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Background\n   The expansion and growth of the Internet has seen the registry\n\
    \   function of a traditionally centralized and managed Network\n   Information\
    \ Center become the responsibility of various autonomous,\n   functionally disparate,\
    \ and globally distributed Internet registries.\n   With the broadening number\
    \ of Internet registries, the uses of their\n   administrative directory services\
    \ have expanded from the original and\n   traditional use of the whois [6] protocol\
    \ to include the use of whois\n   outside the scope of its specification, formal\
    \ and informal\n   definitions of syntax, undocumented security mechanisms, the\
    \ use of\n   other protocols, such as rwhois [5], to fulfill other needs, and\n\
    \   proposals for the use of other technologies such as LDAP [4] and XML.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Requirements Scope
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Requirements Scope\n   The scope of the requirements captured in this document\
    \ relate to the\n   directory services of Internet registries and their related\n\
    \   communities (Section 2.3, Section 2.4, and Section 2.5).  This\n   scoping\
    \ specifically targets the requirements of domain name\n   registries (Section\
    \ 2.1).  The requirements for other registry types\n   will be made available\
    \ in other memos.  The requirements are of both\n   the current use of these directory\
    \ services and the desired\n   functionality based on input from relevant forums\
    \ (Appendix B.1).\n   These requirements are not specific to any protocol.  Terms\
    \ used in\n   the definition of requirements in this document may be found in\
    \ the\n   glossary (Appendix A).\n   The scope of the requirements in this document\
    \ are also restricted to\n   access of data from Internet registries.  Requirements\
    \ for\n   modification, addition, or provisioning of data in Internet\n   registries\
    \ are out of the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Requirements Specification
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Requirements Specification\n   The requirements captured in this document\
    \ are for the purpose of\n   designing technical specifications.  The words used\
    \ in this document\n   for compliance with RFC 2119 [3] do not reference or specify\
    \ policy\n   and speak only to the capabilities in the derived technology.  For\n\
    \   instance, this document may say that the protocol \"MUST\" support\n   certain\
    \ features.  An actual service operator is always free to\n   disable it (and\
    \ then to return an error such as \"permission denied\".)\n   Requirements in\
    \ this document specifying the capabilities of the\n   protocol required for proper\
    \ interaction between a client and a\n   server will be specified with the \"\
    MUST/SHOULD\" language of RFC 2119\n   [3].  This document also contains language\
    \ relating to the\n   interaction of a client with multiple servers to form a\
    \ coherent,\n   cross-network service.  Such service requirements will not be\n\
    \   described using RFC 2119 language.\n   While individual servers/service operators\
    \ may not support all\n   features that the protocol can support, they must respect\
    \ the\n   semantics of the protocol queries and responses.  For example, a\n \
    \  server should not return referrals if it does not have referent data.\n"
- title: 2. Internet Registry Communities
  contents:
  - "2. Internet Registry Communities\n   The Internet registries are composed of\
    \ various communities which\n   provide scope for the requirements in this document.\
    \  These\n   communities can be generalized into the following categories:\n \
    \  registries, registrars, implementers, end-users, and other actors.\n"

- title: 2.1.1.  Domain Registries
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Domain Registries\n   Domain registries are responsible for the registration\
    \ of domains for\n   use with DNS [1] and forward lookups (i.e., does not include\
    \ the\n   .ARPA domain).  These registries have typically served two main\n  \
    \ domain functions: as the registry for a gTLD or as a registry for a\n   ccTLD.\
    \  In some instances, one entity will operate multiple TLD's,\n   both of the\
    \ gTLD and ccTLD type.  A gTLD or ccTLD domain registry\n   operator may be a\
    \ governmental entity, non-governmental,\n   non-commercial entity, or a commercial\
    \ entity.\n   Some ccTLD's have second-level domain registrations similar in nature\n\
    \   to gTLD's or have distinctly separate entities operating second-level\n  \
    \ domain registries similar in nature to gTLD's within the ccTLD.\n   Domain registries\
    \ usually follow one of two models for conducting\n   registrations of domains.\
    \  The \"thick\" model is the more traditional\n   model.  In a \"thick\" domain\
    \ registry, the registry contains both the\n   operational data for the domain\
    \ and the contact data (Appendix A) for\n   the domain.  In this model, the registry\
    \ is typically the interface\n   to the domain registrant but may also interface\
    \ with the domain\n   registrant through domain registrars.  The \"thin\" model\
    \ domain\n   registry contains only operational data for domains.  In the \"thin\"\
    \n   model, contact data for the domain are maintained by a domain\n   registrar.\n\
    \   Domain registries not described in this section (Section 2.1.1) are\n   not\
    \ the subject of this document and may have requirements that are\n   out of scope\
    \ for this subject matter.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Domain Registrars
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Domain Registrars\n   Domain registrars accept domain registrations from\
    \ registrants on\n   behalf of domain registries, both \"thick\" and \"thin\"\
    .  In a \"thin\"\n   model registry/registrar system, a domain registrar maintains\
    \ the\n   contact data of a domain while the registry maintains the operational\n\
    \   data of a domain.  In a \"thick\" model registry/registrar system, a\n   domain\
    \ registrar passes both the operational data and contact data to\n   the registry.\
    \  Domain registrars may register a domain on behalf of a\n   registrant in more\
    \ than one domain registry.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Other Registries
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Other Registries\n   This section describes Internet registries other than\
    \ those listed in\n   Section 2.1.  These descriptions are not definitive and\
    \ this list is\n   not absolute.  They are provided in this document for informational\n\
    \   purposes only.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Regional Internet Registries
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Regional Internet Registries\n   Regional Internet Registries (RIR's)\
    \ administer the allocation of IP\n   address space and autonomous system numbers.\
    \  Each RIR serves a\n   specific geographic region, and collectively they service\
    \ the entire\n   Internet.  Each RIR is a membership-based, non-profit organization\n\
    \   that facilitates and implements global addressing policy based on the\n  \
    \ direction of their regional community.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Local Internet Registries
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Local Internet Registries\n   Local Internet Registries (LIR's) and National\
    \ Internet Registries\n   (NIR's) are sub-registries of RIR's and coordinate the\
    \ same functions\n   of the RIR's for smaller, more specific geographic regions,\
    \ sovereign\n   nations, and localities.\n"
- title: 2.2.3.  Internet Routing Registries
  contents:
  - "2.2.3.  Internet Routing Registries\n   Internet Routing Registries are routing\
    \ policy databases.  Their\n   purpose is to provide information helpful in administering\
    \ Internet\n   routers.  Frequently, the syntax and contents are defined by RPSL\n\
    \   [7].\n   IRR's are operated by academic, commercial, governmental, and other\n\
    \   types of organizations, including several of the RIR's.  The contents\n  \
    \ of the databases vary and reflect the needs of the users directly\n   served\
    \ (e.g., an ISP may look up route entries, added by their\n   customers, to decide\
    \ whether to accept specific route advertisements\n   they receive).\n   Unlike\
    \ RIR and domain registry data, IRR data is often duplicated\n   between separate\
    \ organizations.  The IRR data has the unique\n   characteristics of being largely\
    \ available through other sources\n   (i.e., it is advertised by the Internet\
    \ routing protocols) and most\n   often having a common data format, RPSL.\n"
- title: 2.2.4.  Incident Coordination Contact Registries
  contents:
  - "2.2.4.  Incident Coordination Contact Registries\n   Incident coordination contact\
    \ registries allow operators of network\n   resources such as network infrastructure,\
    \ network names, or network\n   services to register contact information for the\
    \ purpose of providing\n   a means of incident notification.  Using this type\
    \ of registry, an\n   operator of network resources are provided information for\
    \ contacting\n   the operator of another network resource from which an incident\
    \ may\n   be occurring.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Implementers
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Implementers\n   Implementers of client software are often either affiliated\
    \ with\n   large network operators, registry operators, or commercial entities\n\
    \   offering value-added services, or are general citizens of the\n   Internet.\
    \  Much of the client software for use with the directory\n   services of Internet\
    \ registries is either freely available, open\n   source, or both, or available\
    \ as a service.  Implementers of server\n   software are often affiliated with\
    \ operators or commercial entities\n   specializing in the out-sourcing of development\
    \ for Internet\n   registries.\n"
- title: 2.4.  End Users
  contents:
  - "2.4.  End Users\n   This section describes the many types of end-users.  Individuals\
    \ and\n   organizations may have multiple roles and may concurrently occupy\n\
    \   many of the categories.\n"
- title: 2.4.1.  Internet Resource Registrants
  contents:
  - "2.4.1.  Internet Resource Registrants\n   Entities given authority over an Internet\

    \ directly or via the\n   services of a registrar.\n"
- title: 2.4.2.  Service Providers and Network Operators
  contents:
  - "2.4.2.  Service Providers and Network Operators\n   Service providers and network\
    \ operators provide connectivity,\n   routing, and naming services to many other\
    \ entities, some commercial\n   and some non-commercial, both large and small.\
    \  Their operational and\n   administrative staff often interact with Internet\
    \ registries on\n   behalf of other end-users.  Service providers and network\
    \ operators\n   interact with all of the Internet registry operators outlined\
    \ in this\n   document on a frequent and consistent basis.  For example, network\n\
    \   operators use the directory services of Internet registries to\n   determine\
    \ contact information for network resources that have\n   technical problems.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.3.  Intellectual Property Holders\n   A number of parties, such as trademark,\
    \ service mark and intellectual\n   property holders, individuals, governments\
    \ and other geopolitical\n   entities, have some legal rights on certain alphanumeric\
    \ strings.\n   They use the directory services of Internet registries, mostly\
    \ domain\n   registries and registrars, for purposes of maintaining and defending\n\
    \   claims to domain names consistent with applicable laws and\n   regulations.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.6.  DNS Users\n   Users of the Internet have client software that resolves\
    \ domain names\n   to IP addresses and IP addresses to domain names.  Often when\
    \ trouble\n   occurs in the resolution process of DNS, these users trouble shoot\n\
    \   system problems with the aid of information from the directory\n   services\
    \ of Internet registries.\n"
- title: 2.4.7.  Abusive Users
  contents:
  - "2.4.7.  Abusive Users\n   The administrative directory services of Internet registries\
    \ are\n   often the target of practices by abusive users.  Using information\n\
    \   obtained from Internet registries, abusive users undertake certain\n   activities\
    \ that are counter to the acceptable use of the information\n   as intended by\
    \ a registry, registrar, or registrant.  Many times,\n   these practices violate\
    \ law in the jurisdiction of the user,\n   registry, registrar, or registrant.\
    \  One example is the use of\n   Internet registry information for the use of\
    \ sending unsolicited bulk\n   or commercial email.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Client Authentication\n   Entities accessing the service (users) MUST be\
    \ provided a mechanism\n   for passing credentials to a server for the purpose\
    \ of\n   authentication.  The protocol MUST provide a mechanism capable of\n \
    \  employing many authentication types and capable of extension for\n   future\
    \ authentication types.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.4.  Structured Queries and Responses\n   To provide for machine consumption\
    \ as well as human consumption, the\n   protocol MUST employ structured queries\
    \ and responses.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Existing Schema Language
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Existing Schema Language\n   To provide structured queries and responses\
    \ and allow for minimal\n   technological reinvention, the protocol MUST employ\
    \ a pre-existing\n   schema language.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Defined Schemas
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Defined Schemas\n   To provide for machine consumption as well as human\
    \ consumption, the\n   protocol MUST define schemas for use by the structured\

  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA consideration for any service meeting these\
    \ requirements will\n   depend upon the technologies chosen and MUST be specified\
    \ by any\n   document describing such a service.\n"
- title: 7. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   This document contains requirements for the validation\
    \ of\n   authenticated entities and the access of authenticated entities\n   compared\
    \ with the access of non-authenticated entities.  This\n   document does not define\
    \ the mechanism for validation of\n   authenticated entities.  Requirements defined\
    \ in this document MUST\n   allow for the implementation of this mechanism according\
    \ best common\n   practices.\n   The requirement in Section 3.1.4 must be weighed\
    \ against other\n   requirements specifying search or lookup capabilities.\n \
    \  This document contains requirements for referrals and entity\n   references.\
    \  Client implementations based on these requirements\n   SHOULD take proper care\
    \ in the safe-guarding of credential\n   information when resolving referrals\
    \ or entity references according\n   to best common practices.\n   This document\
    \ contains requirements for the distribution of queries\n   among a mesh of participating\
    \ service providers.  Protocols proposed\n   to meet these requirements must be\
    \ able to protect against the use of\n   that distribution system as a vector\
    \ of distributed denial of service\n   attacks or unauthorized data mining.\n"
