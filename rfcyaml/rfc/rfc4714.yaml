- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The work of the IETF is to discuss, develop, and disseminate\n\
    \   technical specifications to support the Internet's operation.\n   Therefore,\
    \ an important output of the IETF is published technical\n   specifications. \
    \ The IETF technical publisher is responsible for the\n   final steps in the production\
    \ of the published technical\n   specifications.  This document sets forth requirements\
    \ on the duties\n   of the IETF technical publisher and how it interacts with\
    \ the IETF in\n   the production of those publications.\n   The term \"technical\
    \ specification\" is used here purposefully to refer\n   to the technical output\
    \ of the IETF.  This document does not engage\n   in the debate about whether\
    \ it is expressed as RFCs or otherwise,\n   what \"is\" an RFC, how to classify\
    \ them, etc.  These issues are\n   considered out of scope.\n   The intention\
    \ of this document is to clarify the IETF's consensus on\n   its requirements\
    \ for its technical publication service.  It is\n   expected to be used in the\
    \ preparation of future contracts.  This\n   document is not a discussion of how\
    \ well the current technical\n   publisher (the RFC Editor) fulfills those requirements.\n"
- title: 2.  Scope
  contents:
  - "2.  Scope\n   The scope of this document is the requirements for the technical\n\
    \   publication process for the IETF.  Requirements on a technical\n   publisher\
    \ can be expressed in terms of both what tasks the IETF\n   technical publisher\
    \ is responsible for and performance targets the\n   IETF technical publisher\
    \ should meet.  The functions provided by the\n   technical publisher are sometimes\
    \ referred to as editorial management\n   [RFC2850].\n   This document specifically\
    \ addresses those documents published by the\n   IETF technical standards process.\
    \  In all cases, the requirements\n   have been written in generic terms, so that\
    \ they may be used to\n   express the requirements of other publication streams,\
    \ elsewhere.\n   The list of potential technical publication tasks was derived\
    \ by\n   considering the tasks currently performed by the RFC Editor as well\n\
    \   as the responsibilities of the technical publishers in other\n   standards\
    \ organizations including 3GPP, ATIS, ETSI, IEEE, and ITU.\n   This requirements\
    \ document focuses on process issues in how the IETF\n   technical publisher serves\
    \ the IETF.  There are related issues\n   regarding non-technical aspects of document\
    \ content that are not\n   addressed in this requirements document.  Issues not\
    \ addressed in\n   this document are:\n   o  Policies governing the acceptable\
    \ input and output document\n      formats (including figures, etc.)\n   o  Policies\
    \ governing the acceptable character sets\n      (internationalization)\n   o\
    \  Policies governing the layout and style of published documents\n   o  Policies\
    \ governing the contents of non-technical sections\n      (acknowledgement sections,\
    \ reference classifications, etc.)\n   It is realized that the above policies\
    \ are also important aspects in\n   determining that the final published document\
    \ is a product of the\n   IETF.  These policies are likely to evolve as part of\
    \ the ongoing\n   IETF dialog.  The IETF technical publisher should be part of\
    \ the\n   discussions of these policies and be prepared to implement and\n   facilitate\
    \ policy changes as they are determined by IETF consensus.\n   This requirement\
    \ is captured under the discussion of process and\n   document evolution.\n"

  - "2.1.  Stages in the Technical Specification Publication Lifetime\n   Figure 1\
    \ below provides a useful summary of where technical\n   publication falls in\
    \ the current lifetime of a document in the IETF\n   standards process.  This\
    \ figure shows a Working Group (WG) document\n   and the reviews including Working\
    \ Group Last Call (WGLC), Area\n   Director (AD) review, IETF Last Call (IETF\
    \ LC), IANA review, and IESG\n   review.  The document shepherd (shown in the\
    \ diagram as \"Shepherd\")\n   is an individual designated by the IESG to shepherd\
    \ a document\n   through the reviews and the publication process and is often\
    \ not an\n   AD.  The lifetime is very similar for AD-sponsored IETF documents,\n\

- title: 3.  Technical Publication Tasks and Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Technical Publication Tasks and Requirements\n   Standards development organizations\
    \ all have technical publication as\n   part of their process.  However, the boundaries\
    \ between what is done\n   by the technical committees and the technical publisher\
    \ vary.\n   The following are potential tasks of a technical publisher.  The\n\
    \   following list was derived after analyzing the technical publication\n   policies\
    \ of the IETF and other standards development organizations.\n   1.  Pre-approval\
    \ review or editing\n   2.  Preliminary specification availability\n   3.  Post-approval\
    \ editorial cleanup (non-author editing)\n   4.  Validation of references\n  \
    \ 5.  Validation of formal languages\n   6.  Insertion of parameter values\n \
    \  7.  Post-approval, pre-publication technical corrections\n   8.  Allocation\
    \ of permanent stable identifiers\n   9.  Document format conversions\n   10.\
    \ Language translation\n   11. Publication status tracking\n   12. Expedited handling\n\
    \   13. Exception handling\n   14. Notification of publication\n   15. Post-publication\

    \ evolution\n   21. Tutorial and help services\n   22. Liaison and communication\
    \ support\n   For each of these tasks, we discuss its relevance to the IETF and\
    \ how\n   it is realized within the IETF processes.  Based upon this\n   information,\
    \ we derive requirements on the IETF technical publisher.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Pre-approval Review or Editing
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Pre-approval Review or Editing\n   Task Description: This provides a review\
    \ or editing service to\n   improve document quality prior to the approval of\
    \ a document.  This\n   review process would normally address issues such as grammar,\n\
    \   spelling, formatting, adherence to pre-approval boilerplate, document\n  \
    \ structure, etc.\n   Discussion: Pre-approval review is not part of the current\
    \ IETF\n   standards process, but this concept has been explored in the early\n\
    \   copyediting experiment.  Early feedback from the experiment has been\n   promising;\
    \ however, the effectiveness of early editing is still being\n   evaluated.\n\
    \   Derived Requirements:\n   Req-PREEDIT-1: The IETF technical publisher should\
    \ be capable of\n   performing an editorial review of documents early enough to\
    \ allow\n   changes to be reviewed within the technical review process, should\n\
    \   the IETF choose to implement pre-approval editing.  For the IETF\n   standards\
    \ process stream, this review should be performed before WG\n   Last Call and\
    \ provide feedback to the authors to improve the quality\n   of the documents.\
    \  For the IETF standards process stream, the\n   publisher should not perform\
    \ a technical review of the document.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Preliminary Specification Availability
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Preliminary Specification Availability\n   Task Description: Some standards\
    \ organizations require their\n   publisher to make available a preliminary version\
    \ of a document (with\n   appropriate caveats) to make the information available\
    \ to the\n   industry as early as possible.  This document is provided \"as is\"\
    \n   after the approval.  This document is withdrawn once the final\n   document\
    \ is published.\n   Discussion: This is not required.  A final approved version\
    \ is\n   available as an internet draft.  If publication can take more than 6\n\
    \   months, it may be necessary to request that the draft version remains\n  \
    \ available.\n   Derived Requirements: none\n"
- title: 3.3.  Post-approval Editorial Cleanup (Non-author Editing)
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Post-approval Editorial Cleanup (Non-author Editing)\n   Task Description:\
    \ Most technical publishers do an editorial review to\n   ensure the quality of\
    \ published documents.  Typically, this may\n   address issues such as grammar,\
    \ spelling, readability, formatting,\n   adherence to boilerplate, document structure,\
    \ etc.  Since any\n   proposed changes occur after approval, a review and signoff\
    \ mechanism\n   should usually be established to ensure that the required changes\
    \ are\n   truly editorial.  Since such changes occur outside of the normal\n \
    \  approval process, it is desirable that such changes are minimized.\n   Most\
    \ standards organizations target \"light\" editing due to the\n   dangers of changing\
    \ agreed-on text.\n   Discussion: Within the IETF, the RFC Editor does post-approval\n\
    \   cleanup review and editing.  The ambition level for cleanup can vary\n   from:\n\
    \   o  corrections to errors only,\n   o  light rewriting,\n   o  significant\
    \ editing of documents with less skillful WG editors,\n      and minimal editing\
    \ when the WG editors were skilled, to\n   o  rewriting of all documents to the\
    \ dictates of a style manual.\n   At times in the past year, stylistic editing\
    \ has resulted in a\n   substantial number of changes in many documents.  These\
    \ changes must\n   then be vetted by all the authors followed by subsequent rounds\
    \ of\n   author acceptance and re-vetting.  This can add up to a substantial\n\
    \   delay in the publication process, which must be weighed against the\n   incremental\
    \ gain in communication improvement accomplished by the\n   cleanup.\n   Changes\
    \ to improve readability (or possibly even grammar) can end up\n   inadvertently\
    \ affecting consensus wording or technical meaning.  Note\n   that pre-approval\
    \ editing to some extent avoids this problem.\n   In specific instances, it may\
    \ be necessary to require that text be\n   published \"verbatim\" even if doing\
    \ so introduces what is perceived as\n   poor readability or stylistic inconsistency.\
    \  Examples of this\n   include:\n   -  \"Boilerplate\" agreed on in an IETF working\
    \ group to apply to all\n      instances of derivative works (e.g., IANA registration\
    \ documents\n      and Management Information Bases (MIBs)).\n   -  Text referring\
    \ to other organizations' work that has been\n      carefully phrased and arranged\
    \ with representatives of that other\n      organization to deal with some politically\
    \ sensitive issue.\n   If pre-approval editing or review is done, it may be possible\
    \ to\n   reduce or even eliminate entirely the post-approval editing task in\n\
    \   some cases.  Pre-approval editing may be more efficient since a\n   separate\
    \ change control process is not required.\n   Derived Requirements:\n   o  Req-POSTEDIT-1\
    \ - The IETF technical publisher should review the\n      document for grammar,\
    \ spelling, formatting, alignment with\n      boilerplate, document structure,\
    \ etc.  The review should strive to\n      maintain consistency in appearance\
    \ with previously published\n      documents.  In the IETF standards process stream,\
    \ the publisher\n      should not perform a technical review of the document.\n\
    \   o  Req-POSTEDIT-2 - All changes made to post-approval documents\n      should\
    \ be tracked and the changes must be signed off on by the\n      appropriate technical\
    \ representatives.  For the IETF standards\n      process stream, this includes\
    \ the authors, the document shepherd\n      (if there is one), and the Area Director.\
    \  The Area Director is\n      the authority for approval of all changes.\n  \
    \ o  Req-POSTEDIT-3 - The IETF technical publisher should exercise\n      restraint\
    \ in making stylistic changes that introduce a substantial\n      review load\
    \ but only provide an incremental increase in the\n      clarity of the specification.\
    \  Specific guidelines on the types of\n      changes allowed may be further specified,\
    \ but ultimately restraint\n      in editing must be imposed by the IETF technical\
    \ publisher.\n      Changes for stylistic consistency should be done only when\
    \ there\n      are major problems with the quality of the document.\n   o  Req-POSTEDIT-4\
    \ - The IETF technical publisher should exercise\n      restraint in making changes\
    \ to improve readability that may change\n      technical and consensus wording.\
    \  Specific guidelines on the types\n      of changes allowed may be further specified,\
    \ but ultimately\n      restraint in editing must be imposed by the IETF technical\n\
    \      publisher.\n   o  Req-POSTEDIT-5 - In specific instances, where some or\
    \ all of\n      document text is the result of a careful negotiation of\n    \
    \  contributions (within or between working groups, reviewers, etc.),\n      the\
    \ technical publisher may be required to publish that text\n      verbatim.  In\
    \ the IETF standards process, verbatim publication may\n      be requested by\
    \ the IESG.  It is the expectation of the IETF\n      community that this will\
    \ not be done often.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Validation of References
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Validation of References\n   Task Description: Most standards organizations\
    \ require that normative\n   references be publicly available.  Some technical\
    \ publishers verify\n   the validity and availability of references (including\
    \ referenced\n   clauses and figures).  Although some editorial cleanup of references\n\
    \   may be obvious, the issue becomes more severe when reference links\n   are\
    \ broken, are not publicly available, or refer to obsoleted\n   documents.  Such\
    \ faults may be viewed as a post-approval fault found\n   in the document.  Most\
    \ publishers have the ability to put a document\n   on hold awaiting the publication\
    \ of a reference expected to be\n   available soon.\n   Discussion: The RFC Editor\
    \ may put a document on hold while waiting\n   for the availability of other IETF\
    \ documents.  Incorrect references\n   are handled like any other fault detected\
    \ in the editorial review.\n   Derived Requirements:\n   o  Req-REFVAL-1 - The\
    \ IETF technical publisher should ensure that all\n      references within specifications\
    \ are currently available and are\n      expected to remain available.\n   o \
    \ Req-REFVAL-2 - The IETF technical publisher should delay\n      publication\
    \ until all required (normative) references are ready\n      for publication.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Validation of Formal Languages
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Validation of Formal Languages\n   Task Description: If the specification\
    \ contains a formal language\n   section (such as a MIB), the technical publisher\
    \ may be required to\n   validate this using a tool.\n   Discussion: The RFC Editor\
    \ syntactically validates sections of a\n   document containing MIBs, Augmented\
    \ Backus Naur Form (ABNF),\n   eXtensible Markup Language (XML), Abstract Syntax\
    \ Notation One\n   (ASN.1), and possibly other formal languages.\n   Derived Requirements:\n\
    \   o  Req-FORMALVAL-1 - The IETF technical publisher should validate the\n  \
    \    syntax of sections of documents containing formal languages.  In\n      particular,\
    \ ASN.1, ABNF, and XML should be verified using\n      appropriate tools.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Insertion of Parameter Values
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Insertion of Parameter Values\n   Task Description: The technical publisher\
    \ is expected to work with\n   IANA (or possibly other organizations maintaining\
    \ registries) to\n   populate assigned protocol parameter values when required,\
    \ prior to\n   publication.  The population of these parameters values should\
    \ not\n   require technical expertise by the technical publisher.\n   Discussion:\
    \ Within the IETF, IANA normally does its allocations as an\n   early step in\
    \ the technical publication process.\n   Derived Requirements:\n   o  Req-PARAMEDIT-1\
    \ - The IETF technical publisher should work with\n      IANA in the population\
    \ of required parameter values into\n      documents.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Post-approval, Pre-publication Technical Corrections
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Post-approval, Pre-publication Technical Corrections\n   Task Description:\
    \ Regardless of efforts to minimize their occurrence,\n   it is always possible\
    \ that technical flaws will be discovered in the\n   window between document approval\
    \ and publication.  The technical\n   publisher may be requested to incorporate\
    \ technical changes into the\n   document prior to publication.  Such changes\
    \ necessitate a review and\n   sign-off procedure.  Another option is to disallow\
    \ such corrections\n   and treat them as post-publication errata would be treated.\
    \  Note\n   that this task is distinct from post-approval changes that might\n\
    \   originate due to editorial review because they originate from outside\n  \
    \ the technical publisher.  For severe flaws, it should always be\n   possible\
    \ to withdraw the document from the publication queue (see\n   Section 3.13).\n\
    \   Discussion: The IETF allows minor technical corrections during the\n   publication\
    \ process.  This should ideally be a rare occurrence.\n   Since any changes introduced\
    \ during the post-approval phase can lead\n   to publication delays, it is important\
    \ that only changes with\n   technical merit be permitted.  In particular, stylistic\
    \ changes\n   should be discouraged.  IETF processes must be in place to vet\n\
    \   changes proposed by the author, but this is not specifically a\n   requirement\
    \ on the technical publisher.\n   The interaction between the authors and the\
    \ technical publisher must\n   be sufficiently well policed that untracked and\
    \ unapproved changes\n   cannot be introduced by the author or other parties.\n\
    \   Derived Requirements:\n   o  Req-POSTCORR-1 - The IETF technical publisher\
    \ should permit the\n      incorporation of technical changes detected after approval\
    \ but\n      pre-publication.\n   o  Req-POSTCORR-2 - The IETF technical publisher\
    \ should only allow\n      post-approval technical changes that have been approved\
    \ by the\n      appropriate party.  In the IETF standards process stream, this\n\
    \      includes the authors and the Area Director.  The document shepherd\n  \
    \    (if there is one) should be kept informed of these changes.\n   o  Req-POSTCORR-3\
    \ - The IETF technical publisher should alert the\n      appropriate authority\
    \ when it feels that a requested change is\n      suspect (e.g., an unapproved\
    \ technical alteration) or unreasonable\n      (e.g., massive editorial changes).\
    \  Further processing of the\n      draft should be suspended pending a response\

    \ Post-approval Editorial Cleanup: The IETF must define under what\n      conditions\
    \ the publisher should be instructed to bypass or\n      minimize post-approval\
    \ editing.\n   o  Approval of Post-approval, Pre-publication Technical Corrections:\n\
    \      Since the technical publisher can only accept approved changes, it\n  \
    \    must be clear who is allowed to approve technical changes.  This\n      process\
    \ within the IETF needs to be decided and documented.\n   o  Allocation of Permanent\
    \ Stable Identifiers: The IETF needs to\n      clearly identify the naming/numbering\
    \ schemes and classes of\n      documents to which those names and numbers apply.\
    \  Furthermore,\n      the responsibility for allocation of those names/numbers\
    \ needs to\n      be identified.\n   o  Expedited Handling: If publication timelines\
    \ can be reduced\n      sufficiently, then expedited handling may no longer be\
    \ needed.\n   o  Post-publication Corrections: Appropriate processes must be\n\
    \      defined with the IETF to ensure that errata are appropriately\n      vetted\
    \ and authorized.\n   o  Indexing: Appropriate processes must be defined within\
    \ the IETF to\n      decide and inform the technical publisher of status changes\
    \ to\n      published documents as the result of an appeal, legal action, or\n\
    \      some other procedural action.\n"

  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   Any new requirements that result from this discussion\
    \ need to be\n   reviewed by IANA and the IETF to understand to what extent, if\
    \ any,\n   the work flow of the documents through IANA is affected.\n   Interactions\
    \ with IANA on population of parameter values is discussed\n   in Section 3.6.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There is a tussle between the sought-for improvements\
    \ in readability\n   and the specific language that has often been negotiated\
    \ carefully\n   for the security content of IETF documents.  As with other text,\n\
    \   extreme caution is needed in modifying any text in the security\n   considerations.\
    \  This issue is assumed to have been dealt with under\n   Section 3.3.\n   The\
    \ processes for the publication of documents should prevent the\n   introduction\
    \ of unapproved changes (see Section 3.7).  Since the IETF\n   publisher maintains\
    \ the index of publications, sufficient security\n   should be in place to prevent\
    \ these published documents from being\n   changed by external parties (see Section\
    \ 3.16)\n"
