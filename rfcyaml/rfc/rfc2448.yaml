- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   It is well known that every bit in a compressed video bitstream\
    \ is\n   not equal. Some bits belong to segments defining vital information\n\
    \   such as picture types, quantization values, parameter ranges, average\n  \
    \ intensity values for image blocks, etc. When transporting compressed\n   video\
    \ bitstreams over packet networks, packet losses from such\n   segments cause\
    \ a much longer lasting and severe degradation on the\n   output of a decoder\
    \ than that caused by packet losses from other\n   segments. We will call the\
    \ vital information-carrying segments \"High\n   Priority (HP)\" segments. The\
    \ rest of the bitstream consists of \"Low\n   Priority (LP)\" segments. Clearly,\
    \ the video outputs resulting from\n   transport techniques that protect the HP\
    \ segments against packet\n   losses are more resilient to packet losses in general.\n\
    \   Protection of the HP segments can be accomplished in many ways. These\n  \
    \ include:\n      - redundant transmission of the HP segments as described\n \
    \       in [3] for MPEG RTP payloads\n      - using forward error correction (FEC)\
    \ techniques\n      - transmitting HP segments over reserved channels or using\n\
    \        differentiated services.\n   Both redundant transmission and FEC techniques\
    \ increase the bandwidth\n   needed to transmit the compressed video bitstream.\
    \ FEC techniques\n   increase the effectiveness of this additional bandwidth for\
    \ packet\n   loss protection at the expense of increased processing at the\n \
    \  receiver and the transmitter ends and increased overall delay. Using\n   channel\
    \ reservations or differentiated services based approaches may\n   be the best\
    \ solutions for protecting the HP segments but, they\n   require network infrastructure\
    \ changes.\n   This document outlines another set of HP segment protection\n \
    \  techniques based on AT&T/Lucent patents [1, 2] that can be used for\n   reliable\
    \ video transmission over packet networks without a built-in\n   prioritization\
    \ mechanism. These techniques use reliable transport\n   protocols and \"out-of-band\"\
    \ delivery approaches. In this context, the\n   term \"out-of-band\" is used to\
    \ imply information transmission means\n   other than those used for transmitting\
    \ the main video stream.  The\n   details of these techniques are discussed in\
    \ the following sections.\n   An implementation of these, as applied to MPEG-2\
    \ video transmission\n   over IP networks, is described in [4].\n   The IESG/IETF\
    \ take no position regarding the validity or scope of any\n   intellectual property\
    \ right or other rights that might be claimed to\n   pertain to the implementation\
    \ or use of the technology, or the extent\n   to which any license under such\
    \ rights might or might not be\n   available.  See the IETF IPR web page at http://www.ietf.org/ipr.html\n\

- title: 2. Identification of the HP segments
  contents:
  - "2. Identification of the HP segments\n   The classification of a part of a video\
    \ bitstream as an HP segment\n   depends on two factors.  The first one is the\
    \ encoding algorithm used\n   in compressing the video data. It is impossible\
    \ to segment a\n   compressed video bitstream without knowing the syntax and the\n\
    \   semantics of the encoding algorithm. The second factor is the\n   determination\
    \ of a compromise between the HP segment size and the\n   corresponding loss resilience.\
    \ As the segment size increases, so does\n   the loss resilience.  On the other\
    \ hand, it may not be feasible to\n   deliver large HP segments reliably.\n  \
    \ As an example, the \"data partitioning\" method of the MPEG-2 standard\n   [5]\
    \ defines the syntax and semantics for one particular way of\n   partitioning\
    \ an MPEG-2 encoded video bitstream into HP and LP\n   segments.  In data partitioning,\
    \ the smallest useful HP segment can\n   be selected to contain only the header\
    \ information, which is usually\n   less than two percent of the video data. HP\
    \ segments defined this way\n   contain vital information including picture type,\
    \ quantization\n   factor, motion vector ranges, etc. without which the rest of\
    \ the\n   bitstream is not decodable.  As an alternative, the DC coefficients\n\
    \   (the average values) for each picture macroblock may be included in\n   the\
    \ HP segment increasing its size to about 40% of the bitstream.\n   This way HP\
    \ segments can be made to carry somewhat usable video\n   information also; however,\
    \ their reliable transmission may become a\n   demanding task.\n   Since it is\
    \ not possible to formulate a general technique that can be\n   used for identifying\
    \ the HP segments in any encoded video bitstream,\n   we will assume that such\
    \ segments are identified some way prior to\n   the transmission. For example,\
    \ some encoders can generate HP and LP\n   segments separately, a stored bitstream\
    \ can be in the partitioned\n   format, etc. Also, consistent with most of the\
    \ popular coding\n   techniques, we assume that the HP segments (HP1, HP2, ...)\
    \ are\n   dispersed on the entire bitstream over time as shown in Fig. 1.\n  \
    \ +---+----------------+---+----------------------+---+-----\n   |HP1|     LP1\
    \        |HP2|        LP2           |HP3| ...\n   +---+----------------+---+----------------------+---+-----\n\
    \                                Figure 1\n       HP segments dispersed on an\

- title: 3. Transmission of HP data using a reliable transport protocol [1]
  contents:
  - "3. Transmission of HP data using a reliable transport protocol [1]\n   In this\
    \ approach, one or more of the HP segments are transmitted\n   using a reliable\
    \ transport protocol prior to starting the\n   transmission of the LP segments.\
    \ For point-to-point applications,\n   TCP, for multipoint applications, an appropriate\
    \ reliable multicast\n   protocol [6] may be used for transporting the HP segments.\
    \ The number\n   of HP segments to be sent before starting the transmission of\
    \ the LP\n   segments depends on the application's tolerance to the start-up\n\
    \   delay.  Depending on the HP segment size and the path-MTU [7], one or\n  \
    \ more HP segments can be put in each packet carrying the HP data.\n   HP segments\
    \ can be packetized using RTP with the following\n   definitions for the header\
    \ fields:\n      Payload Type: A distinct payload type number, which may be\n\
    \      dynamic, should be assigned to HP segments of each video payload.\n   \
    \   M Bit: Set for packets containing HP data for key pictures.\n      timestamp:\
    \ Uses the same format as that of the video payload.\n      Shows the sampling\
    \ time for the video data following the first HP\n      segment in the packet.\n\
    \   The SSRC field may be defined following the rules developed for the\n   transmission\
    \ of layered media streams in [8]. That is:\n      - A single SSRC space is used\
    \ for the HP segment packets and the\n      main video stream. Only the latter\
    \ is used for SSRC allocation and\n      conflict resolution. When a source discovers\
    \ that it has collided,\n      it transmits an RTCP BYE message on only the main\
    \ video stream.\n      - A participant sends sender identification (SDES) on only\
    \ the\n      main video stream.\n   Most HP segments are self-identifying and\
    \ can be packed without any\n   additional headers. For others, techniques used\
    \ for packetizing\n   generic payload types may be used or special payload types\
    \ may be\n   defined.\n   It is possible to send the HP data along with the LP\
    \ data (i.e., the\n   original, unpartitioned bitstream) in addition to sending\
    \ the HP\n   segments separately. This way, the separately transmitted HP segments\n\
    \   are needed only when packet losses occur.\n"
- title: 4. Out-of-band transmission of the HP information [2]
  contents:
  - "4. Out-of-band transmission of the HP information [2]\n   In cases where a certain\
    \ sequence of HP segments is used periodically\n   for the entire duration of\
    \ the video bitstream, this sequence may be\n   transmitted once before the start\
    \ of video transmission using a\n   reliable transport protocol. The receiver\
    \ can save this information\n   and use it to recover lost HP segments during\
    \ the main video\n   transmission.\n   In this approach, the timestamps are not\
    \ meaningful for the HP data\n   and they may not be included in the transmitted\
    \ HP segment sequence.\n   In most cases, the synchronization between the stored\
    \ HP segments and\n   the LP data stream can be accomplished using the key-frames\
    \ because\n   the HP data sequence usually cover the video segment between two\n\
    \   key-frames (e.g. a group-of-pictures (GOP) in MPEG). If the sequence\n   of\
    \ HP segments covers a video sequence with more than one key-frame,\n   some indicator,\
    \ e.g. if available the M-bit may be used to indicate a\n   packet which carries\
    \ the beginning of LP data that follows the first\n   stored HP segment.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   RTP packets transmitted according to the techniques\
    \ outlined in this\n   document are subject to the security considerations discussed\
    \ in the\n   RTP specification [9]. This implies that confidentiality of the media\n\
    \   streams is achieved by encryption. Because the data compression used\n   is\
    \ applied end-to-end, encryption may be performed after compression\n   so there\
    \ is no conflict between the two operations. For certain\n   coding techniques\
    \ and applications, encrypting only the HP segments\n   may provide sufficent\
    \ confidentiality.\n   The described techniques do not introduce any significant\
    \ additional\n   non-uniformity in the receiver side computational complexity\
    \ for\n   packet processing to cause a potential denial-of-service threat.\n"
