  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies the requirements that the Middlebox\n  \
    \ Communication (midcom) protocol must satisfy in order to meet the\n   needs\
    \ of applications wishing to influence the middlebox function.\n   These requirements\
    \ were developed with a specific focus on network\n   address translation and\
    \ firewall middleboxes.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is one of two developed by the Middlebox Communication\n\
    \   (midcom) working group to address the requirements and framework for\n   a\
    \ protocol between middleboxes and \"midcom agents.\"  This document\n   presents\
    \ midcom requirements; [MCFW] presents the context and\n   framework.  [MCFW]\
    \ also presents terminology and definitions and\n   should be read in tandem with\
    \ this one.\n   These requirements were developed by examining the midcom framework\n\
    \   and extracting requirements, both explicit and implicit, that\n   appeared\
    \ there.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements\n   Each requirement is presented as a statement, followed by\
    \ brief\n   explanatory material as appropriate.  Terminology is defined in\n\
    \   [MCFW].  There may be overlap between requirements.\n"

- title: 2.1.1.
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.\n   The Midcom protocol must enable a Midcom agent requiring the services\n\
    \   of a middlebox to establish an authorized association between itself\n   and\
    \ the middlebox.\n   This states that the protocol must allow the middlebox to\
    \ identify an\n   agent requesting services and make a determination as to whether\
    \ or\n   not the agent will be permitted to do so.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.\n   The Midcom protocol must allow a Midcom agent to communicate with\n\
    \   more than one middlebox simultaneously.\n   In any but the most simple network,\
    \ an agent is likely to want to\n   influence the behavior of more than one middlebox.\
    \  The protocol\n   design must not preclude the ability to do this.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.\n   The Midcom protocol must allow a middlebox to communicate with more\n\
    \   than one Midcom agent simultaneously.\n   There may be multiple instances\
    \ of a single application or multiple\n   applications desiring service from a\
    \ single middlebox, and different\n   agents may represent them.  The protocol\
    \ design must not preclude the\n   ability to do so.\n"
- title: 2.1.4.
  contents:
  - "2.1.4.\n   Where a multiplicity of Midcom Agents are interacting with a given\n\
    \   middlebox, the Midcom protocol must provide mechanisms ensuring that\n   the\
    \ overall behavior is deterministic.\n   This states that the protocol must include\
    \ mechanisms for avoiding\n   race conditions or other situations in which the\
    \ requests of one\n   agent may influence the results of the requests of other\
    \ agents in an\n   unpredictable manner.\n"
- title: 2.1.5.
  contents:
  - "2.1.5.\n   The Midcom protocol must enable the middlebox and any associated\n\
    \   Midcom agents to establish a known and stable state.  This must\n   include\
    \ the case of power failure, or other failure, where the\n   protocol must ensure\
    \ that any resources used by a failed element can\n   be released.\n   This states\
    \ that the protocol must provide clear identification for\n   requests and results\
    \ and that protocol operations must be atomic with\n   respect to the midcom protocol.\n"
- title: 2.1.6.
  contents:
  - "2.1.6.\n   The middlebox must be able to report its status to a Midcom agent\n\
    \   with which it is associated.\n"
- title: 2.1.7.
  contents:
  - "2.1.7.\n   The protocol must support unsolicited messages from middlebox to\n\
    \   agent, for reporting conditions detected asynchronously at the\n   middlebox.\n\
    \   It may be the case that exceptional conditions or other events at the\n  \
    \ middlebox (resource shortages, intrusion mitigation) will cause the\n   middlebox\
    \ to close pinholes or release resources without consulting\n   the associated\
    \ Midcom agent.  In that event, the protocol must allow\n   the middlebox to notify\
    \ the agent.\n"
- title: 2.1.8.
  contents:
  - "2.1.8.\n   The Midcom protocol must provide for the mutual authentication of\n\
    \   Midcom agent and middlebox to one another.\n   In addition for the more obvious\
    \ need for the Midcom agent to\n   authenticate itself to the middlebox, there\
    \ are some attacks against\n   the protocol which can be mitigated by having the\
    \ middlebox\n   authenticate to the agent.  See [MCFW].\n"
- title: 2.1.9.
  contents:
  - "2.1.9.\n   The Midcom protocol must allow either the Midcom agent or the\n  \
    \ middlebox to terminate the Midcom session between a Midcom Agent and\n   a middlebox.\
    \  This allows either entity to close the session for\n   maintenance, security,\
    \ or other reasons.\n"
- title: 2.1.10.
  contents:
  - "2.1.10.\n   A Midcom agent must be able to determine whether or not a request\
    \ was\n   successful.\n   This states that a middlebox must return a success or\
    \ failure\n   indication to a request made by an agent.\n"
- title: 2.1.11.
  contents:
  - "2.1.11.\n   The Midcom protocol must contain version interworking capabilities\
    \ to\n   enable subsequent extensions to support different types of middlebox\n\
    \   and future requirements of applications not considered at this stage.\n  \
    \ We assume that there will be later revisions of this protocol.  The\n   initial\
    \ version will focus on communication with firewalls and NATs,\n   and it is possible\
    \ that the protocol will need to be modified, as\n   support for other middlebox\
    \ types is added.  These version\n   interworking capabilities may include (but\
    \ are not limited to) a\n   protocol version number.\n"
- title: 2.1.12.
  contents:
  - "2.1.12.\n   It must be possible to deterministically predict the behavior of\
    \ the\n   middlebox in the presence of overlapping rules.\n   The protocol must\
    \ preclude nondeterministic behavior in the case of\n   overlapping rulesets,\
    \ e.g. by ensuring that some known precedence is\n   imposed.\n"

- title: 2.2.1.
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.\n   The syntax and semantics of the Midcom protocol must be extensible\
    \ to\n   allow the requirements of future applications to be adopted.\n   This\
    \ is related to, but different from, the requirement for\n   versioning support.\
    \  As support for additional middlebox types is\n   added there may be a need\
    \ to add new message types.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.\n   The Midcom protocol must support the ability of an agent to install\
    \ a\n   ruleset that governs multiple types of middlebox actions (e.g.\n   firewall\
    \ and NAT).\n   This states that a the protocol must support rules and actions\
    \ for a\n   variety of types of middleboxes.  A Midcom agent ought to be able\
    \ to\n   have a single Midcom session with a middlebox and use the Midcom\n  \
    \ interface on the middlebox to interface with different middlebox\n   functions\
    \ on the same middlebox interface.\n"
- title: 2.2.3.
  contents:
  - "2.2.3.\n   The protocol must support the concept of a ruleset group comprising\
    \ a\n   multiple of individual rulesets to be treated as an aggregate.\n   Applications\
    \ using more than one data stream may find it more\n   convenient and more efficient\
    \ to be able to use single messages to\n   tear down, extend, and manipulate all\
    \ middlebox rulesets being used\n   by one instance of the application.\n"
- title: 2.2.4.
  contents:
  - "2.2.4.\n   The protocol must allow the midcom agent to extend the lifetime of\
    \ an\n   existing ruleset that otherwise would be deleted by the middlebox.\n"
- title: 2.2.5.
  contents:
  - "2.2.5.\n   If a peer does not understand an option, it must be clear whether\
    \ the\n   action required is to proceed without the unknown attribute being\n\
    \   taken into account or the request is to be rejected.  Where\n   attributes\
    \ may be ignored if not understood, a means may be provided\n   to inform the\
    \ client about what has been ignored.\n   This states that failure modes must\
    \ be robust, providing sufficient\n   information for the agent or middlebox,\
    \ to be able to accommodate the\n   failure or to retry with a new option that\
    \ is more likely to succeed.\n"
- title: 2.2.6.
  contents:
  - "2.2.6.\n   To enable management systems to interact with the Midcom environment,\n\
    \   the protocol must include failure reasons that allow the Midcom Agent\n  \
    \ behavior to be modified as a result of the information contained in\n   the\
    \ reason.  Failure reasons need to be chosen such that they do not\n   make an\
    \ attack on security easier.\n"
- title: 2.2.7.
  contents:
  - "2.2.7.\n   The Midcom protocol must not preclude multiple authorized agents from\n\
    \   working on the same ruleset.\n"
- title: 2.2.8.
  contents:
  - "2.2.8.\n   The Midcom protocol must be able to carry filtering rules, including\n\
    \   but not limited to the 5-tuple, from the midcom agent to the\n   middlebox.\n\
    \   By \"5-tuple\", we refer to the standard <source address, source port,\n \
    \  destination address, destination port, transport protocol> tuple.\n   Other\
    \ filtering elements may be carried, as well.\n"
- title: 2.2.9.
  contents:
  - "2.2.9.\n   When the middlebox performs a port mapping function, the protocol\n\
    \   should allow the Midcom agent to request that the external port\n   number\
    \ have the same oddity as the internal port.\n   This requirement is to support\
    \ RTP and RTCP [RFC1889] \"oddity\"\n   requirements.\n"
- title: 2.2.10.
  contents:
  - "2.2.10.\n   When the middlebox performs a port mapping function, the protocol\n\
    \   should allow the Midcom agent to request that a consecutive range of\n   external\
    \ port numbers be mapped to consecutive internal ports.  This\n   requirement\
    \ is to support RTP and RTCP \"sequence\" requirements.\n"
- title: 2.2.11.
  contents:
  - "2.2.11.\n   It should be possible to define rulesets that contain a more specific\n\
    \   filter spec than an overlapping ruleset.  This should allow agents to\n  \
    \ request actions for the subset that contradict those of the\n   overlapping\
    \ set.\n   This should allow a Midcom agent to request to a Midcom server\n  \
    \ controlling a firewall function that a subset of the traffic that\n   would\
    \ be allowed by the overlapping ruleset be specifically\n   disallowed.\n"
