  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In IPv4, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) commonly provide\n  \
    \ IN-ADDR.ARPA information for their customers by prepopulating the\n   zone with\
    \ one PTR record for every available address.  This practice\n   does not scale\
    \ in IPv6.  This document analyzes different approaches\n   and considerations\
    \ for ISPs in managing the IP6.ARPA zone.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC1912] recommended that \"every Internet-reachable host\
    \ should have\n   a name\" and says \"Failure to have matching PTR and A records\
    \ can\n   cause loss of Internet services similar to not being registered in\n\
    \   the DNS at all\".  While the need for a PTR record and for it to match\n \
    \  is debatable as a best practice, some network services (see\n   Section 4)\
    \ still do rely on PTR lookups, and some check the source\n   address of incoming\
    \ connections and verify that the PTR and A records\n   match before providing\
    \ service.\n   Individual Internet users on the residential or consumer scale,\n\
    \   including small and home businesses, are constantly connecting to or\n   moving\
    \ around the Internet.  For large ISPs who serve residential\n   users, maintenance\
    \ of individual PTR records is impractical.\n   Administrators at ISPs should\
    \ consider whether customer PTR records\n   are needed, and if so, evaluate methods\
    \ for responding to reverse DNS\n   queries in IPv6.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Reverse DNS in IPv4
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Reverse DNS in IPv4\n   ISPs that provide access to many residential users\
    \ typically assign\n   one or a few IPv4 addresses to each of those users and\
    \ populate an\n   IN-ADDR.ARPA zone with one PTR record for every IPv4 address.\
    \  Some\n   ISPs also configure forward zones with matching A records so that\n\
    \   lookups match.  For instance, if an ISP Example.com aggregated\n   192.0.2.0/24\
    \ at a network hub in one region, the reverse zone might\n   look like:\n   1.2.0.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\
    \  IN PTR 1.string.region.example.com.\n   2.2.0.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.  IN PTR 2.string.region.example.com.\n\
    \   3.2.0.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.  IN PTR 3.string.region.example.com.\n   .\n   .\n\
    \   .\n   254.2.0.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.  IN PTR 254.string.region.example.com.\n \
    \  The conscientious Example.com might then also have a zone:\n   1.string.region.example.com.\
    \  IN A 192.0.2.1\n   2.string.region.example.com.  IN A 192.0.2.2\n   3.string.region.example.com.\
    \  IN A 192.0.2.3\n   .\n   .\n   .\n   254.string.region.example.com.  IN A 192.0.2.254\n\
    \   Many ISPs generate PTR records for all IP addresses used for\n   customers,\
    \ and many create the matching A record.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Reverse DNS Considerations in IPv6
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Reverse DNS Considerations in IPv6\n   A sample entry for 2001:0db8:0f00:0000:0012:34ff:fe56:789a\
    \ might be:\n   a.9.8.7.6.5.e.f.f.f.4.3.2.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.f.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2\n\
    \   .IP6.ARPA.  IN PTR 1.string.region.example.com.\n   ISPs will often delegate\
    \ an IPv6 prefix to their customers.  Since\n   2^^80 possible addresses could\
    \ be configured in a single /48 zone\n   alone, it is impractical to write a zone\
    \ with every possible address\n   entered, even with automation.  If 1000 entries\
    \ could be written per\n   second, the zone would still not be complete after\
    \ 38 trillion years.\n   Furthermore, it is often impossible to associate hostnames\
    \ and\n   addresses, since the 64 bits in the Interface Identifier portion of\n\
    \   the address are frequently assigned using Stateless Address\n   Autoconfiguration\
    \ (SLAAC) [RFC4862] when the host comes online, and\n   they may be short-lived.\n\
    \   [RFC1912] is an Informational RFC that says \"PTR records must point\n   back\
    \ to a valid A record\" and further that the administrator should\n   \"Make sure\
    \ your PTR and A records match.\"  Herein are considerations\n   for how to follow\
    \ this advice for AAAA and PTR records.\n"
- title: 2.  Alternatives in IPv6
  contents:
  - "2.  Alternatives in IPv6\n   Several options exist for providing reverse DNS\
    \ in IPv6.  All of\n   these options also exist for IPv4, but the scaling problem\
    \ is much\n   less severe in IPv4.  Each option should be evaluated for its scaling\n\
    \   ability, compliance with existing standards and best practices, and\n   availability\
    \ in common systems.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Negative Response
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Negative Response\n   Some ISP DNS administrators may choose to provide\
    \ only an NXDOMAIN\n   response to PTR queries for subscriber addresses.  In some\
    \ ways, this\n   is the most accurate response, since no name information is known\n\
    \   about the host.  However, providing a negative response to PTR\n   queries\
    \ does not satisfy the expectation in [RFC1912] for entries to\n   match.  Users\
    \ of services that are dependent on a successful lookup\n   will have a poor experience.\
    \  For instance, some web services and\n   Secure Shell (SSH) connections wait\
    \ for a DNS response, even\n   NXDOMAIN, before responding.  For the best user\
    \ experience, then, it\n   is important to return a response, rather than time\
    \ out with no\n   answer.  On the other hand, external mail servers are likely\
    \ to\n   reject connections, which might be an advantage in fighting spam.\n \
    \  When evaluating this option, DNS administrators should consider the\n   uses\
    \ for reverse DNS records and the number of services affecting the\n   number\
    \ of users.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Wildcard Match
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Wildcard Match\n   The use of wildcards in the DNS is described in [RFC4592],\
    \ and their\n   use in IPv6 reverse DNS is described in [RFC4472].\n   While recording\
    \ all possible addresses is not scalable, it may be\n   possible to record a wildcard\
    \ entry for each prefix assigned to a\n   customer.  Consider also that \"inclusion\
    \ of wildcard NS RRSets in a\n   zone is discouraged, but not barred\".  [RFC4592]\n\
    \   This solution generally scales well.  However, since the response\n   will\
    \ match any address in the wildcard range (/48, /56, /64, etc.), a\n   forward\
    \ DNS lookup on the response given will not be able to return\n   the same hostname.\
    \  This method therefore fails the expectation in\n   [RFC1912] that forward and\
    \ reverse will match.  DNSSEC [RFC4035]\n   scalability is limited to signing\
    \ the wildcard zone, which may be\n   satisfactory.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Dynamic DNS
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Dynamic DNS\n   One way to ensure that forward and reverse records match\
    \ is for hosts\n   to update DNS servers dynamically once interface configuration\
    \ is\n   complete (whether by SLAAC, DHCPv6, or other means), as described in\n\
    \   [RFC4472].  Hosts would need to provide both AAAA and PTR updates and\n  \
    \ would need to know which servers would accept the information.\n   This option\
    \ should scale as well or as poorly as IPv4 dynamic DNS\n   (DDNS) does.  Dynamic\
    \ DNS may not scale effectively in large ISP\n   networks that have no single\
    \ master name server, but a single master\n   server is not best practice.  The\
    \ ISP's DNS system may provide a\n   point for Denial-of-Service attacks, including\
    \ many attempted DDNS\n   updates.  Accepting updates only from authenticated\
    \ sources may\n   mitigate this risk, but only if authentication itself does not\n\
    \   require excessive overhead.  No authentication of dynamic DNS updates\n  \
    \ is inherently provided.  Implementers should therefore consider use\n   of TSIG\
    \ [RFC2845], or at least ingress filtering, so that updates are\n   only accepted\
    \ from customer address space from internal network\n   interfaces.  They should\
    \ also rate limit the number of updates from a\n   customer per second and consider\
    \ impacts on scalability.  UDP is\n   allowed per [RFC2136], so connection reliability\
    \ is not assured,\n   though the host should expect an ERROR or NOERROR message\
    \ from the\n   server; TCP provides transmission control, but the updating host\n\
    \   would need to be configured to use TCP.\n   Administrators may want to consider\
    \ user creativity if they provide\n   hostnames, as described in Section 5.5,\
    \ \"User Creativity\".\n   There is no assurance of uniqueness if multiple hosts\
    \ try to update\n   with the same name (\"mycomputer.familyname.org\").  There\
    \ is no\n   standard way to indicate to a host what server it should send DDNS\n\
    \   updates to; the master listed in the SOA is often assumed to be a\n   DDNS\
    \ server, but this may not scale.\n"
- title: 2.3.1.  Dynamic DNS from Individual Hosts
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Dynamic DNS from Individual Hosts\n   In the simplest case, a residential\
    \ user will have a single host\n   connected to the ISP.  Since the typical residential\
    \ user cannot\n   configure IPv6 addresses or resolving name servers on their\
    \ hosts,\n   the ISP should provide address information conventionally -- i.e.,\n\
    \   using their normal combination of Router Advertisements (RAs), DHCP,\n   etc.\
    \  The ISP should also provide a DNS Recursive Name Server and\n   Domain Search\
    \ List as described in [RFC3646] or [RFC8106].  In\n   determining its Fully Qualified\
    \ Domain Name (FQDN), a host will\n   typically use a domain from the Domain Search\
    \ List.  This is an\n   overloading of the parameter; multiple domains could be\
    \ listed, since\n   hosts may need to search for unqualified names in multiple\
    \ domains\n   without necessarily being a member of those domains.  Administrators\n\
    \   should consider whether the Domain Search List actually provides an\n   appropriate\
    \ DNS suffix(es) when considering use of this option.  For\n   the purposes of\
    \ dynamic DNS, the host would concatenate its local\n   hostname (e.g., \"hostname\"\
    ) plus the domain(s) in the Domain Search\n   List (e.g., \"customer.example.com\"\
    ), as in\n   \"hostname.customer.example.com\".\n   Once it learns its address\
    \ and has a resolving name server, the host\n   must perform an SOA lookup on\
    \ the IP6.ARPA record to be added in\n   order to find the owner and eventually\
    \ the server that is\n   authoritative for the zone (which might accept dynamic\
    \ updates).\n   Several recursive lookups may be required to find the longest\
    \ prefix\n   that has been delegated.  The DNS administrator must designate the\n\
    \   Primary Master Server for the longest match required.  Once found,\n   the\
    \ host sends dynamic AAAA and PTR updates using the concatenation\n   defined\
    \ above (\"hostname.customer.example.com\").\n   In order to use this alternative,\
    \ hosts must be configured to use\n   dynamic DNS.  This is not default behavior\
    \ for many hosts, which is\n   an inhibitor for a large ISP.  This option may\
    \ be scalable, although\n   registration following an outage may cause significant\
    \ load, and\n   hosts using privacy extensions [RFC4941] may update records daily.\n\
    \   It is up to the host to provide matching forward and reverse records\n   and\
    \ update them when the address changes.\n"
- title: 2.3.2.  Dynamic DNS through Residential Gateways
  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Dynamic DNS through Residential Gateways\n   Residential customers may\
    \ have a gateway, which may provide DHCPv6\n   service to hosts from a delegated\
    \ prefix.  ISPs should provide a DNS\n   Recursive Name Server and Domain Search\
    \ List to the gateway, as\n   described above and in [RFC3646] and [RFC8106].\
    \  There are two\n   options for how the gateway uses this information.  The first\
    \ option\n   is for the gateway to respond to DHCPv6 requests with the same DNS\n\
    \   Recursive Name Server and Domain Search List provided by the ISP.\n   The\
    \ alternate option is for the gateway to relay dynamic DNS updates\n   from hosts\
    \ to the servers and domain provided by the ISP.  Host\n   behavior is unchanged;\
    \ the host sends the same dynamic updates,\n   either to the ISP's server (as\
    \ provided by the gateway) or to the\n   gateway for it to forward.  The gateway\
    \ would need to be capable of\n   and configured to use dynamic DNS.\n"
- title: 2.3.3.  Automatic DNS Delegations
  contents:
  - "2.3.3.  Automatic DNS Delegations\n   An ISP may delegate authority for a subdomain,\
    \ such as\n   \"customer12345.town.AW.customer.example.com\" or\n   \"customer12345.example.com\"\
    , to the customer's gateway.  Each domain\n   thus delegated must be unique within\
    \ the DNS.  The ISP may also then\n   delegate the IP6.ARPA zone for the prefix\
    \ delegated to the customer,\n   as in (for 2001:db8:f00::/48) \"0.0.f.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA\"\
    .\n   Then, the customer could provide updates to their own gateway, with\n  \
    \ forward and reverse.  However, individual hosts connected directly to\n   the\
    \ ISP rarely have the capability to run DNS for themselves;\n   therefore, an\
    \ ISP can only delegate to customers with gateways\n   capable of being authoritative\
    \ name servers.  If a device requests a\n   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation, that may\
    \ be considered a reasonably\n   reliable indicator that it is a gateway, rather\
    \ than an individual\n   host.  It is not necessarily an indicator that the gateway\
    \ is capable\n   of providing DNS services and therefore cannot be relied upon\
    \ as a\n   way to test whether this option is feasible.  In fact, this kind of\n\
    \   delegation will not work for devices complying with [RFC6092], which\n   includes\
    \ the requirement, \"By DEFAULT, inbound DNS queries received\n   on exterior\
    \ interfaces MUST NOT be processed by any integrated DNS\n   resolving server\"\
    .\n   If the customer's gateway is the name server, it provides its own\n   information\
    \ to hosts on the network, as described in [RFC2136], which\n   is often done\
    \ for enterprise networks.\n   An ISP could provide authoritative responses as\
    \ a secondary server to\n   the customer's master server.  For instance, the home\
    \ gateway name\n   server could be the master server, with the ISP providing the\
    \ only\n   published NS authoritative servers.\n   To implement this alternative,\
    \ users' residential gateways must be\n   capable of acting as authoritative name\
    \ servers capable of dynamic\n   DNS updates.  There is no mechanism for an ISP\
    \ to dynamically\n   communicate to a user's equipment that a zone has been delegated,\
    \ so\n   user action would be required.  Most users have neither the equipment\n\
    \   nor the expertise to run DNS servers, so this option is unavailable\n   to\
    \ the residential ISP.\n"
- title: 2.3.4.  Generate Dynamic Records
  contents:
  - "2.3.4.  Generate Dynamic Records\n   An ISP's name server that receives a dynamic\
    \ forward or reverse DNS\n   update may create a matching entry.  Since a host\
    \ capable of updating\n   one is generally capable of updating the other, this\
    \ should not be\n   required, but redundant record creation will ensure that a\
    \ record\n   exists.  ISPs implementing this method should check whether a record\n\
    \   already exists before accepting or creating updates.\n   This method is also\
    \ dependent on hosts being capable of providing\n   dynamic DNS updates, which\
    \ is not default behavior for many hosts.\n"
- title: 2.3.5.  Populate from DHCP Server
  contents:
  - "2.3.5.  Populate from DHCP Server\n   An ISP's DHCPv6 server may populate the\
    \ forward and reverse zones\n   when the DHCP request is received if the request\
    \ contains enough\n   information [RFC4704].\n   However, this method will only\
    \ work for a single host address\n   (IA_NA); the ISP's DHCP server would not\
    \ have enough information to\n   update all records for a prefix delegation. \
    \ If the zone authority is\n   delegated to a home gateway that used this method,\
    \ the gateway could\n   update records for residential hosts.  To implement this\
    \ alternative,\n   users' residential gateways would have to support the FQDN\
    \ DHCP\n   option and would have to either have the zones configured or send\n\
    \   DDNS messages to the ISP's name server.\n"
- title: 2.3.6.  Populate from RADIUS Server
  contents:
  - "2.3.6.  Populate from RADIUS Server\n   A user may receive an address or prefix\
    \ from a RADIUS server\n   [RFC2865], the details of which may be recorded via\
    \ RADIUS Accounting\n   data [RFC2866].  The ISP may populate the forward and\

    \  This\n   solution allows the ISP to populate data concerning allocated\n  \
    \ prefixes as per Section 2.2 (wildcards) and customer premise\n   equipment (CPE)\
    \ endpoints.  However, as with Section 2.3.5, it does\n   not allow the ISP to\

- title: 2.4.  Delegate DNS
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Delegate DNS\n   For customers who are able to run their own DNS servers,\
    \ such as\n   commercial customers, often the best option is to delegate the\n\

    \ since most residential users have neither the equipment nor\n   the expertise\
    \ to run DNS servers, this method is unavailable to\n   residential ISPs.\n  \
    \ This is a general case of the specific case described in\n   Section 2.3.3.\

  contents:
  - "2.5.  Dynamically Generate PTR When Queried (\"On the Fly\")\n   Common practice\
    \ in IPv4 is to provide PTR records for all addresses,\n   regardless of whether\

    \ directions.  This option has the advantage of\n   assuring matching forward\
    \ and reverse entries while being simpler\n   than dynamic DNS.  Administrators\
    \ should consider whether the lack of\n   user-specified hostnames is a drawback.\
    \  It may be possible to allow\n   user-specified hostnames for some records and\
    \ generate others on the\n   fly; looking up a record before generating on the\
    \ fly may slow\n   responses or may not scale well.\n   DNSSEC [RFC4035] signing\
    \ records on the fly may increase load;\n   unsigned records can indicate that\
    \ these records are less trusted,\n   which might be acceptable.\n   Another consideration\
    \ is that the algorithm used for generating the\n   record must be the same on\
    \ all servers for a zone.  In other words,\n   any server for the zone must produce\
    \ the same response for a given\n   query.  Administrators managing a variety\
    \ of rules within a zone\n   might find it difficult to keep those rules synchronized\
    \ on all\n   servers.\n"

  - "3.  Manual User Updates\n   It is possible to create a user interface, such as\
    \ a web page, that\n   would allow end users to enter a hostname to associate\
    \ with an\n   address.  Such an interface would need to be authenticated; only\
    \ the\n   authorized user could add/change/delete entries.  If the ISP changes\n\
    \   prefixes assigned to customers, the interface would need to specify\n   only\
    \ the host bits.  The backend would therefore need to be\n   integrated with prefix\
    \ assignments so that when a new prefix was\n   assigned to a customer, the DNS\
    \ service would look up user-generated\n   hostnames, delete the old record, and\
    \ create the new one.\n   Considerations about some records being static and others\
    \ dynamic or\n   dynamically generated (Section 2.5) and the creativity of users\n\
    \   (Section 5.5) still apply.\n"
- title: 4.  Considerations and Recommendations
  contents:
  - "4.  Considerations and Recommendations\n   There are six common uses for PTR\
    \ lookups:\n   Rejecting mail: A PTR with a certain string may indicate \"This\
    \ host\n   is not a mail server\", which may be useful for rejecting probable\n\
    \   spam.  The absence of a PTR leads to the desired behavior.\n   Serving ads:\
    \ \"This host is probably in town.province.\"  An ISP that\n   does not provide\
    \ PTR records might affect somebody else's geolocation\n   (also see privacy consideration\
    \ about location).\n   Accepting SSH connections: The presence of a PTR may be\
    \ inferred to\n   mean \"This host has an administrator with enough clue to set\
    \ up\n   forward and reverse DNS\".  This is a poor inference.\n   Log files:\
    \ Many systems will record the PTR of remote hosts in their\n   log files to make\
    \ it easier when reading logs later to see what\n   network the remote host uses.\n\
    \   Traceroute: The ability to identify an interface and name of any\n   intermediate\
    \ node or router is important for troubleshooting.\n   Service discovery: [RFC6763]\
    \ specifies \"DNS-Based Service Discovery\",\n   and Section 11 specifically describes\
    \ how PTRs are used.\n   As a general guideline, when address assignment and name\
    \ are under\n   the same authority, or when a host has a static address and name,\n\
    \   AAAA and PTR records should exist and match.  For residential users,\n   if\
    \ these use cases are important to the ISP, the administrator will\n   then need\
    \ to consider how to provide PTR records.\n   The best accuracy would be achieved\
    \ if ISPs delegated authority along\n   with address delegation, but residential\
    \ users rarely have domain\n   names or authoritative name servers.\n   Dynamic\
    \ DNS updates can provide accurate data, but there is no\n   standard way to indicate\
    \ to residential devices where to send\n   updates, whether the hosts support\
    \ DDNS, or whether it scales.\n   An ISP has no knowledge of its residential users'\
    \ hostnames and\n   therefore can either provide a wildcard response or a dynamically\n\
    \   generated response.  A valid negative response (such as NXDOMAIN) is\n   a\
    \ valid response if the four cases above are not essential;\n   delegation where\
    \ no name server exists should be avoided.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Using Reverse DNS for Security
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Using Reverse DNS for Security\n   Some people think the existence of reverse\
    \ DNS records, or matching\n   forward and reverse DNS records, provides useful\
    \ information about\n   the hosts with those records.  For example, one might\
    \ infer that the\n   administrator of a network with properly configured DNS records\
    \ was\n   better informed, and by further inference more responsible, than the\n\
    \   administrator of a less thoroughly configured network.  For instance,\n  \
    \ most email providers will not accept incoming connections on port 25\n   unless\
    \ forward and reverse DNS entries match.  If they match, but\n   information higher\
    \ in the stack (for instance, mail source) is\n   inconsistent, the packet is\
    \ questionable.  However, these records may\n   be easily forged unless DNSSEC\
    \ or other measures are taken.  The\n   string of inferences is questionable and\
    \ may become unneeded if other\n   means for evaluating trustworthiness (such\
    \ as positive reputations)\n   become predominant in IPv6.\n   Providing location\
    \ information in PTR records is useful for\n   troubleshooting, law enforcement,\
    \ and geolocation services, but for\n   the same reasons, it can be considered\
    \ sensitive information.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.2.  DNS Security with Dynamic DNS\n   The security considerations for using\
    \ dynamic DNS are described in\n   [RFC3007].  DNS Security Extensions are documented\
    \ in [RFC4033].\n   Interactions with DNSSEC are described throughout this document.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Considerations for Other Uses of the DNS
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Considerations for Other Uses of the DNS\n   Several methods exist for\
    \ providing encryption keys in the DNS.  Any\n   of the options presented here\
    \ may interfere with these key\n   techniques.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Privacy Considerations\n   Given the considerations in [RFC8117], hostnames\
    \ that provide\n   information about a user compromise that user's privacy.  Some\
    \ users\n   may want to identify their hosts using user-specified hostnames, but\n\
    \   the default behavior should not be to identify a user, their\n   location,\
    \ their connectivity, or other information in a PTR record.\n"
- title: 5.5.  User Creativity
  contents:
  - "5.5.  User Creativity\n   Though not precisely a security consideration, administrators\
    \ may\n   want to consider what domain will contain the records and who will\n\
    \   provide the names.  If subscribers provide hostnames, they may\n   provide\
    \ inappropriate strings.  Consider \"ihate.example.com\" or\n   \"badword.customer.example.com\"\
    \ or\n   \"celebrityname.committed.illegal.acts.example.com\".\n"
