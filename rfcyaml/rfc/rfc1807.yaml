  - "Abstract\n   This RFC defines a format for bibliographic records describing\n\
    \   technical reports.  This format is used by the Cornell University\n   Dienst\
    \ protocol and the Stanford University SIFT system.  The\n   original RFC (RFC\
    \ 1357) was written by D. Cohen, ISI, July 1992.\n   This is a revision of RFC\
    \ 1357.  New fields include handle,\n   other_access, keyword, and withdraw.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   Many universities and other R&D organizations routinely announce\
    \ new\n   technical reports by mailing (via the postal services) the\n   bibliographic\
    \ records of these reports.\n   These mailings have non-trivial cost and delay.\
    \  In addition, their\n   recipients cannot conveniently file them, electronically,\
    \ for later\n   retrieval and searches.\n   Publishing organizations that wish\
    \ to use e-mail or file transfer to\n   obtain these announcements can do so by\
    \ using the following format.\n   Organizations may automate to any degree (or\
    \ not at all) both the\n   creation of these records (about their own publications)\
    \ and the\n   handling of the records received from other organizations.\n   This\
    \ format is designed to be simple, for people and for machines, to\n   be easy\
    \ to read (\"human readable\") and create without any special\n   programs.\n\
    \   This RFC defines the format of bibliographic records, not how to\n   process\
    \ them.\n   This format is a \"tagged\" format with self-explaining alphabetic\n\
    \   tags. It should be possible to prepare and to read bibliographic\n   records\
    \ using any text editor, without any special programs.\n   This RFC includes the\
    \ CR-CATEGORY, a field useful for Computer\n   Science publications.  It is expected\
    \ that similar fields will be\n   added for other domains.\n   This format, as\
    \ described in RFC 1357, was implemented as part of the\n   Dienst system and\
    \ has been in use by the five ARPA-funded computer\n   science institutions to\
    \ exchange bibliographic records (Cornell, SU,\n   UC, MIT, and CMU).  Programs\
    \ have been written to map between this\n   RFC and structured USMARC (format\
    \ developed at the Library of\n   Congress) cataloging records, also from USMARC\
    \ to the RFC.\n   The focus of this ARPA-funded research has been into many aspects\
    \ of\n   digital libraries including searching and accessing techniques that\n\
    \   do not necessarily use bibliographic records (for example, natural\n   language\
    \ processing, automatic and full-text indexing).  However, the\n   continued use\
    \ of bibliographic records is expected to remain an\n   important part of the\
    \ library system environment of the future and\n   its use is an important link\
    \ between the physical world of scientific\n   works and the on-line world of\
    \ digital objects. The format described\n   in this paper allows a link between\
    \ these two worlds to be created.\n   This format was developed with considerable\
    \ help and involvement of\n   Computer Science and Library personnel from several\
    \ organizations,\n   including Carnegie Mellon University, Corporation for National\n\
    \   Research Initiatives (CNRI), Cornell University, University of\n   Southern\
    \ California/Information Sciences Institute (ISI), Meridian\n   (now called DynCorp),\
    \ Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford\n   University, and the University\
    \ of California.  Key contributions were\n   provided by Jerry Saltzer of MIT,\
    \ and Larry Lannom of DynCorp.  The\n   initial draft was prepared by Danny Cohen\
    \ and Larry Miller of ISI.\n   The revision was done by Rebecca Lasher from Stanford\
    \ with assistance\n   from the CS-TR participants.\n   This RFC does not place\
    \ any limitations on the dissemination of the\n   bibliographic records.  If there\
    \ are limitations on the dissemination\n   of the publication, it should be protected\
    \ by some means such as\n   passwords.  This RFC does not address this protection.\n\
    \   The use of this format is encouraged.  There are no limitations on\n   its\
    \ use.\n"

  - "Meta Format\n    * Keep It Simple.\n    * One bibliographic record for each publication,\
    \ where a\n      \"publication\" is whatever the publishing institution\n    \
    \  defines as such.\n   * A record contains several fields.\n   * Each field starts\
    \ with its tag (aka the field-ID) which is a\n     reserved identifier (containing\
    \ no separators) at the\n     beginning of a new line with or without spaces before\
    \ it),\n     followed by two colons (\"::\"), followed by the field data.\n  \
    \ * Continuation lines:  Lines are limited to 79 characters.\n     When needed,\
    \ fields may continue over several lines, with an\n     implied space in between.\
    \  In order to simplify the use no\n     special marking is used to indicate continuation\
    \ line.\n     Hence, fields are terminated by a line that starts (apart\n    \
    \ from white space) with a word followed by two colons.  Except\n     for the\
    \ \"END::\" that is terminated by the end of line.)  For\n     improved human\
    \ readability it is suggested to start\n     continuation lines with some spaces.\n\
    \   * Several fields are mandatory and must appear in the record.\n     All fields\
    \ (unless specifically not permitted to) may be in\n     any order and may be\
    \ repeated as needed (e.g., the AUTHOR\n     field).  The order of the repeated\
    \ fields is always\n     preserved.\n   * Only printable ASCII characters are\
    \ to be used.  The permissible\n     characters are ASCII codes 040 (Space) through\
    \ 176(~)\n     and line breaks which are \\012 (LF) or \\012\\015 (CRLF).\n  \
    \   Empty lines indicate paragraph break.  \\009 (tab) must be\n     replaced\
    \ by spaces.  This specifically forbids tabs, null\n     characters, DEL, backspaces,\
    \ etc.  (i.e., if used, the record is\n     invalid.)\n     However full 8 bit\
    \ ASCII may be used.  WARNING: some\n     electronic mailers cannot handle 8 bit\
    \ ASCII and these\n     records may need to be transported via other mechanisms.\n\
    \     Throughout this document the word \"publisher\" means the\n     publishing\
    \ organization of a report (e.g., a university or a\n     department thereof),\
    \ not necessarily an organization authorized\n     to issue ISBN numbers.\n  \

    \ that publish reports (such as\n   universities, departments, and laboratories)\

    \   registration of other key parameters and names in the Internet.\n   Rebecca\
    \ Lasher (RLASHER@Forsythe.stanford.edu), of Stanford working\n   with CNRI has\
    \ agreed to coordinate this registration with the IANA\n   for the publishers\
    \ of Computer Science technical reports.  It is\n   suggested that before using\
    \ this format the publishing organizations\n   would coordinate with her (by e-mail)\
    \ their symbols and the names of\n   their organizations.\n   In order to help\
    \ automated handling of the received bibliographic\n   records, it is expected\
