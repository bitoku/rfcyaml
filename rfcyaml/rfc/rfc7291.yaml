  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315]
    options\n   that can be used to configure hosts with PCP server [RFC6887] IP\n
    \  addresses.\n   This specification assumes a PCP server is reachable with one
    or\n   multiple IP addresses.  As such, a list of IP addresses can be\n   returned
    in the DHCP PCP server option.\n   This specification allows returning one or
    multiple lists of PCP\n   server IP addresses.  This is used as a hint to guide
    the PCP client\n   when determining whether to send PCP requests to one or multiple
    PCP\n   servers.  Concretely, the PCP client needs an indication to decide\n   whether
    entries need to be instantiated in all PCP servers (e.g.,\n   multi-homing, multiple
    PCP-controlled devices providing distinct\n   services, etc.) or use one IP address
    from the list (e.g., redundancy\n   group scenario, proxy-based model, etc.).
    \ Refer to [PCP-DEPLOYMENT]\n   for a discussion on PCP deployment scenarios.\n
    \  For guidelines on how a PCP client can use multiple IP addresses and\n   multiple
    PCP servers, see [PCP-SERVER].\n"

  - "5.  DHCP Server Configuration Guidelines\n   DHCP servers supporting the DHCP
    PCP server option can be configured\n   with a list of IP addresses of the PCP
    server(s).  If multiple IP\n   addresses are configured, the DHCP server MUST
    be explicitly\n   configured whether all or some of these addresses refer to:\n
    \  1.  the same PCP server: the DHCP server returns multiple addresses\n       in
    the same instance of the DHCP PCP server option.\n   2.  distinct PCP servers:
    the DHCP server returns multiple lists of\n       PCP server IP addresses to the
    requesting DHCP client (encoded as\n       multiple OPTION_V6_PCP_SERVERs or in
    the same\n       OPTION_V4_PCP_SERVER); each list is referring to a distinct PCP\n
    \      server.  For example, multiple PCP servers may be configured to a\n       PCP
    client in some deployment contexts such as multi-homing.  It\n       is out of
    the scope of this document to enumerate all deployment\n       scenarios that
    require multiple PCP servers to be returned.\n   Precisely how DHCP servers are
    configured to separate lists of IP\n   addresses according to which PCP server
    they address is out of the\n   scope of this document.  However, DHCP servers
    MUST NOT combine the\n   IP addresses of multiple PCP servers and return them
    to the DHCP\n   client as if they belong to a single PCP server, and DHCP servers\n
    \  MUST NOT separate the addresses of a single PCP server and return\n   them
    as if they belong to distinct PCP servers.  For example, if an\n   administrator
    configures the DHCP server by providing a Fully\n   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
    for a PCP server, even if that FQDN\n   resolves to multiple addresses, the DHCP
    server MUST deliver them\n   within a single server address block.\n   DHCPv6
    servers that implement this option and that can populate the\n   option by resolving
    FQDNs will need a mechanism for indicating\n   whether to query for A records
    or only AAAA records.  When a query\n   returns A records, the IP addresses in
    those records are returned in\n   the DHCPv6 response as IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.\n
    \     Discussion: The motivation for this design is to accommodate\n      deployment
    cases where an IPv4 connectivity service is provided\n      while only DHCPv6
    is in use (e.g., an IPv4-only PCP server in a\n      Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite)
    context [RFC6333]).\n   Since this option requires support for IPv4-mapped IPv6
    addresses, a\n   DHCPv6 server implementation will not be complete if it does
    not\n   query for A records and represent any that are returned as\n   IPv4-mapped
    IPv6 addresses in DHCPv6 responses.  This behavior is\n   neither required nor
    suggested for DHCPv6 options in general: it is\n   specific to OPTION_V6_PCP_SERVER.
    \ The mechanism whereby DHCPv6\n   implementations provide this functionality
    is beyond the scope of\n   this document.\n   For guidelines on providing context-specific
    configuration\n   information (e.g., returning a regional-based configuration)
    and\n   information on how a DHCP server might be configured with FQDNs that\n
