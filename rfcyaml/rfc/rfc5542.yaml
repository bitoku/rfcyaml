    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).  Objects\n   in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the Structure\n   of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
    module\n   that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC\n
    \  2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
