The current IETF process has two types of RFCs: standards track documents and other RFCs (e.g., informational, experimental, FYIs).
The intent of the standards track documents is clear, and culminates in an official Internet Standard.
Informational RFCs can be published on a less formal basis, subject to the reasonable constraints of the RFC Editor.
Informational RFCs are not subject to peer review and carry no significance whatsoever within the IETF process.
The IETF currently has no mechanism or means of publishing documents that express its deep concern about something important, but otherwise contain absolutely no useful information whatsoever.
This document creates a new subseries of RFCs, entitled, IETF Statements Of Boredom (SOBs).
The SOB process is similar to that of the normal standards track.
The SOB is submitted to the IAB, the IRSG, the IESG, the SOB Editor (Morpheus), and the Academie Francais for review, analysis, reproduction in triplicate, translation into ASN.1, and distribution to Internet insomniacs.
However, once everyone has approved the document by falling asleep over it, the process ends and the document is discarded.
The resulting vacuum is viewed as having the technical approval of the IETF, but it is not, and cannot become, an official Internet Standard.
Security Considerations Security issues are not discussed in this memo, but then again, no other issues of any importance are discussed in this memo either.
