  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies a method for secondary DNS servers to honour\n\
    \   the SOA EXPIRE field as if they were always transferring from the\n   primary,\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The expire field of a DNS zone's SOA record [RFC1035] is\
    \ supposed to\n   indicate when a secondary server shall discard the contents\
    \ of the\n   zone when it has been unable to contact the primary [RFC1034].\n\
    \   Current practice only works when all the secondaries contact the\n   primary\
    \ directly to perform refresh queries and zone transfers.\n   While secondaries\
    \ are expected to be able to, and often are\n   configured to, transfer from other\
    \ secondaries for robustness reasons\n   as well as reachability constraints,\
    \ there is no mechanism provided\n   to preserve the expiry behaviour when using\
    \ a secondary.  Instead,\n   secondaries have to know whether they are talking\
    \ directly to the\n   primary or another secondary and use that to decide whether\
    \ or not to\n   update the expire timer.  This, however, fails to take into account\n\
    \   delays in transferring from one secondary to another.\n   There are also zone-transfer\
    \ graphs in which the secondary never\n   talks to the primary, so the effective\
    \ expiry period becomes\n   multiplied by the length of the zone-transfer graph,\
    \ which is\n   infinite when it contains loops.\n   This document provides a mechanism\
    \ to preserve the expiry behaviour\n   regardless of what zone-transfer graph\
    \ is constructed and whether the\n   secondary is talking to the primary or another\
    \ secondary.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Expire EDNS Option (Query)\n   The EDNS [RFC6891] EXPIRE option has the value\
    \ <9>.  The EDNS EXPIRE\n   option MAY be included on any QUERY, though usually\
    \ this is only done\n   on SOA, AXFR, and IXFR queries involved in zone maintenance.\
    \  This is\n   done by adding a zero-length EDNS EXPIRE option to the options\
    \ field\n   of the OPT record when the query is made.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Primary Server\n   When the query is directed to the primary server for\
    \ the zone, the\n   response will be an EDNS EXPIRE option of length 4 containing\

- title: 3.2.  Secondary Server
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Secondary Server\n   When the query is directed to a secondary server for\

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Non-authoritative Server\n   If an EDNS EXPIRE option is sent to a server\

    \ to\n   the response.\n"
- title: 4.  Secondary Behaviour
  contents:
  - "4.  Secondary Behaviour\n   When a secondary server performs a zone-transfer\
    \ request or a zone-\n   refresh query, it SHALL add an EDNS EXPIRE option to\
    \ the query\n   message.\n   If a secondary receives an EDNS EXPIRE option in\
    \ a response to an SOA\n   query, it SHALL update its expire timer to be the maximum\
    \ of the\n   value returned in the EDNS EXPIRE option and the current timer value.\n\
    \   Similarly, if a secondary receives an EDNS EXPIRE option in its\n   response\
    \ to an IXFR query that indicated the secondary is up to date\n   (serial matches\
    \ current serial), the secondary SHALL update the\n   expire timer to be the maximum\
    \ of the value returned in the EDNS\n   EXPIRE option and the current timer value.\n\
    \   If the zone is transferred or updated as the result of an AXFR or\n   IXFR\
    \ query and there is an EDNS EXPIRE option with the response, then\n   the value\
    \ of the EDNS EXPIRE option SHOULD be used instead of the\n   value of the SOA\
    \ EXPIRE field to initialise the expire timer.\n   In all cases, if the value\
    \ of the SOA EXPIRE field is less than the\n   value of the EDNS EXPIRE option,\
    \ then the value of the SOA EXPIRE\n   field MUST be used and MUST be treated\
    \ as a maximum when updating or\n   initialising the expire timer.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has assigned an EDNS option code point for the\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The method described in this document ensures\
    \ that servers that no\n   longer have a connection to the primary server, direct\
    \ or indirectly,\n   cease serving the zone content when SOA EXPIRE timer is reached.\n\
    \   This prevents stale data from being served indefinitely.\n   The EDNS EXPIRE\
    \ option exposes how long the secondaries have been out\n   of communication with\
    \ the primary server.  This is not believed to be\n   a problem and may provide\
    \ some benefit to monitoring systems.\n"
