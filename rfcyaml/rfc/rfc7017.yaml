  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.\
    \  This\n   often involves accessing the archived history of those email lists.\n\
    \   Requirements for improved web-based browsing and searching of these\n   archives\
    \ are captured in [RFC6778].  Participants would like to have\n   the ability\
    \ to browse and search those archives using standard IMAP\n   clients.  This memo\
    \ captures the requirements for providing a service\n   that would allow such\
    \ browsing and searching, and it is intended as\n   input to a later activity\
    \ for the design and development of such a\n   service.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements for IMAP Access to Archived IETF Lists
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements for IMAP Access to Archived IETF Lists\n   Many participants\
    \ would prefer to access the list archives using IMAP\n   [RFC3501].  Providing\
    \ this access while meeting the following\n   requirements will likely require\
    \ an IMAP server with specialized\n   capabilities.\n   o  The system should expose\
    \ the archive using an IMAP interface, with\n      each list represented as a\
    \ mailbox.\n   o  This interface must work with standard IMAP clients.\n   o \
    \ The interface should allow users that have provided credentials to\n      each\
    \ have their own read/unread marks for messages.  Allowing\n      other annotation\
    \ is desirable.  The implementation should consider\n      taking advantage of\
    \ the IMAP extensions for ANNOTATE [RFC5257] and\n      METADATA [RFC5464].\n\
    \   o  It must be possible for administrators to set per-user storage\n      quotas,\
    \ limiting the space a user can consume with annotations.\n   o  The interface\
    \ must not allow users to modify the underlying\n      message or metadata other\
    \ than the read/unread marks and\n      annotations described above.  Specifically,\
    \ users must not be able\n      to delete or insert messages, or move them between\
    \ mailboxes in\n      the archive.  (Clients will, of course, be able to make\
    \ local\n      copies of messages from the archive.)\n   o  The interface must\
    \ have server-side searching enabled and should\n      scale to support multiple\
    \ simultaneous extensive searches.  The\n      server should provide the enhanced\
    \ search capabilities described\n      in [RFC6778].  The implementation should\
    \ consider taking advantage\n      of the extensions defined for IMAP SORT and\
    \ THREAD [RFC5256],\n      multimailbox search [RFC6237], and fuzzy search [RFC6203].\n\
    \   o  When the system requires credentials, it must use the\n      datatracker's\
    \ authentication system.\n      -     While the vast majority of archived lists\
    \ have an open\n            access policy, some archived lists have restricted\
    \ archives.\n            The system must make it possible to limit access to a\n\
    \            restricted archive based on login credentials.\n      -     The system\
    \ must allow access to open archives with or\n            without providing credentials.\
    \  Specifically, the system\n            will allow anonymous access using the\
    \ Simple Authentication\n            and Security Layer (SASL) ANONYMOUS mechanism\
    \ [RFC4505] or a\n            LOGIN command with a special username (such as \"\
    anonymous\")\n            determined by the administrator.\n"
- title: 3.  Internationalized Address Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Internationalized Address Considerations\n   The implementation should anticipate\
    \ internationalized email\n   addresses as discussed in the following three documents:\
    \ [RFC6532],\n   [RFC6531], and [RFC6855].  There is no firm requirement at this\
    \ time.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Allowing IMAP as an interface for browsing and\
    \ searching the archives\n   of IETF email lists does not affect the security\
    \ of the Internet in\n   any significant fashion.\n   Searching can be input/output\
    \ (I/O) and CPU intensive.  Clients that\n   make local copies of all messages\
    \ in a mailbox can also present an\n   I/O burden, particularly when synchronizing\
    \ for the first time.  The\n   implementors of this interface should consider\
    \ the potential for\n   maliciously crafted searches attempting to consume a damaging\
    \ amount\n   of resources.  The implementors should consider the potential for\n\
    \   denial-of-service attacks through making many connections to the\n   interface.\
    \  The implementors should consider ways to rate limit I/O\n   due to making local\
    \ copies of messages.\n   Storing read/unread marks and other annotations requires\
    \ potentially\n   unbounded storage space.  The implementors of this interface\
    \ should\n   consider the potential for maliciously crafted annotations attempting\n\
    \   to consume a damaging amount of storage space.  The implementors\n   should\
    \ consider making it easy to alert the administrator when a user\n   begins consuming\
    \ exceptional amounts of space.\n"
