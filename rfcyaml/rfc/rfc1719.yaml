  - "1. Introduction\n   At the Amsterdam IETF meeting, we held a BOF, entitled the\
    \ \"IPDecide\n   BOF\", on the process and progress of the IPng activities.\n\
    \   (\"IPng\" stands for \"IP, the next generation\".   The IPDecide BOF was\n\
    \   chaired by Brian Carpenter.  Minutes are available in the IETF\n   directories,\
    \ with the file name </ietf/93jul/ipdecide-minutes-\n   93jul.txt>.)\n   The IPDecide\
    \ BOF explored several facets of the IPng process, such\n   as:\n      \"What\
    \ is the basis for choosing the next generation IP (i.e., what\n      are the\
    \ technical requirements and decision criteria).\"\n      \"With the advent of\
    \ CIDR and new, more stringent address\n      assignment policies, are we comfortable\
    \ that we truly understand\n      the level of urgency?\"\n      \"Should the\
    \ IETF or the marketplace make the final IPng decision\".\n   The BOF was held\
    \ in a productive atmosphere, but did not achieve what\n   could be called a clear\
    \ consensus among the assembled attendees.  In\n   fact, despite its generally\
    \ productive spirit, it did more to\n   highlight the lack of a firm direction\
    \ than to create it.\n   The IPDecide BOF was followed the next evening by the\
    \ open IESG\n   plenary. During this session, the IESG and the assembled attendees\n\
    \   discussed the IPng issues and seemed to arrive at a consensus based\n   on\
    \ the following set of bullets presented by the IETF chair:\n      \"The IETF\
    \ needs to move toward closure on IPng.\"  That is, the\n      IETF should take\
    \ active steps toward a technical decision, rather\n      than waiting for the\
    \ \"marketplace\" to decide.\n      \"The IESG has the responsibility for developing\
    \ an IPng\n      recommendation for the Internet community.\"  That is, the IESG\n\
    \      should provide leadership and take specific actions to help move\n    \
    \  the IETF toward a technical decision.\n      \"The procedures of the recommendation-making\
    \ process should be\n      open and published well in advance by the IESG.\"\n\
    \      \"As a part of the process, the IPng WGs may be given new\n      milestones\
    \ and other guidance to aid the IESG.\"\n      \"There should be ample opportunity\
    \ for community comment prior to\n      final IESG recommendation (e.g., there\
    \ will be an extended Last\n      Call).\"\n"

  - "2. A Direction For IPng\n   Building on this consensus, I'd like to announce\
    \ a set of specific\n   directions in the IESG that I hope will move us toward\
    \ timely\n   resolution of many of the key IPng issues.\n   The IESG will establish\
    \ a temporary, ad hoc, \"area\" to deal\n   specifically with IPng  issues.  The\
    \ charter for this new IESG area\n   is to develop a recommendation on which,\
    \ if any, of the current\n   proposals should be adopted as the \"next IP\". \
    \ This recommendation\n   will be submitted to the IESG and to the Internet community\
    \ for\n   review.  Following an adequate period of review to surface any\n   community\
    \ concerns, the IESG will issue a final IPng recommendation.\n   All of the current\
    \ IPng-related working groups will be moved\n   immediately into this new area.\n\
    \   This new area will be headed by two co-Area Directors from within the\n  \
    \ IESG. I have asked Allison Mankin (NRL), current Transport Services\n   AD,\
    \ and Scott Bradner (Harvard), current Operational Requirements AD,\n   to serve\
    \ as co-AD's for this temporary area.  I am very pleased to\n   report that they\
    \ have agreed to take this important assignment.\n   (Because this is expected\
    \ to be a temporary assignment, Scott and\n   Allison will also continue to serve\
    \ in their current IESG positions\n   during this period.)\n   All IETF Areas\
    \ are now expected to have Area Directorates.  For the\n   IPng Area, a Directorate\
    \ will be especially important to bring\n   additional viewpoints into the process.\
    \  Therefore, I am asking that,\n   as their first action, Scott and Allison form\
    \ a specific IPng\n   Directorate to act as a direction-setting and preliminary\
    \ review\n   body.  The IPng process will continue to be completely open, and\n\
    \   therefore reports and meeting notes from any IPng Directorate\n   meetings\
    \ will be published in timely fashion.\n"
- title: 3. Issues Toward IPng Resolution
  contents:
  - "3. Issues Toward IPng Resolution\n   Two important issues need resolution immediately\
    \ before we can expect\n   progress toward an IPng recommendation:\n      - What\
    \ is the scope of the effort?\n      That is, should IPng be limited to solving\
    \ the well known scaling\n      and address exhaustion issues; or should IPng\
    \ also include\n      advanced features such as resource reservation for real-time\n\
    \      traffic?\n      The argument in favor of considering advanced features\
    \ is that\n      migration to a new IP is (hopefully, only!) a once-in-a-generation\n\
    \      occurrence, and therefore all advanced features should at least be\n  \
    \    considered.\n      Arguments opposed to considering advanced features include\
    \ the\n      fact that we may not have time for this level of effort before the\n\
    \      scaling and address exhaustion problems confront us, and that we\n    \
    \  may not have the necessary understanding and experience to make\n      all\
    \ the correct choices at this time.\n      - What is the available timeframe?\n\
    \      That is, before we can even begin to make an informed decision\n      about\
    \ the scope, we need a better understanding of the urgency and\n      time constraints\
    \ facing us.\n      Factors that affect the available time include the current\
    \ rate of\n      address assignments (which can give us an estimate of when we\
    \ are\n      currently projected to run out of addresses), the current policies\n\
    \      governing address assignment (which can give us an understanding\n    \
    \  of how policies affect the assignment and utilization rates), the\n      impact\
    \ of CIDR aggregation, the development time for IPng, and the\n      time needed\
    \ to field and migrate to the new IPng.\n   Therefore, I am asking the new AD's\
    \ and the Directorate to start\n   immediately the following specific activities\
    \ to help guide their\n   ultimate IPng recommendation:\n      1. Develop an understanding\
    \ of the available timeframe, covering\n      at least the following issues:\n\
    \         - Review Internet growth metrics, such as the current address\n    \
    \     assignment and utilization rates.  Develop an understanding of\n       \
    \  how the new address assignment policies impact the assignment\n         and\
    \ utilization rates.\n         - Review the expected impact of CIDR address aggregation.\n\
    \         Develop an understanding of the expected savings due to CIDR\n     \
    \    aggregation.\n         - Develop new technical guidelines for classless Internet\n\
    \         addressing.  Specific examples include guidelines for how to\n     \
    \    utilize variable length subnet masks, and how to utilize\n         currently\
    \ unused Class A and B addresses in a classless fashion\n         in hosts and\
    \ routers.\n         - Develop a strong understanding of the time required for\
    \ the\n         development, fielding, and migration for a new IP.\n         -\
    \ Based on all the above issues,\n            (a) develop an estimate for how\
    \ long we have to develop\n            and deploy an IPng.  This could be a set\
    \ of estimates\n            based on best/worst case estimates for how each of\
    \ the\n            above factors will affect the available timeframe.\n      \
    \      (b) Consider whether more stringent assignment policies\n            might\
    \ provide additional time.  If so, recommend such\n            policies.\n   \
    \         (c) make a recommendation on whether it is worthwhile to\n         \
    \   mount a serious effort to reclaim addresses and/or to\n            renumber\
    \ significant portions of the Internet.\n      2. Based on an informed judgment\
    \ of the time constraints above,\n      make a recommendation regarding the scope\
    \ for IPng, i.e., should\n      IPng consider scaling issues only or advanced\
    \ topics also.\n      3. Based on the scope and time constraints, develop a clear\
    \ and\n      concise set of technical requirements and decision criteria for\n\
    \      IPng.  These should include, but not be limited to, the criteria\n    \
    \  outlined in the IESG statement (RFC1380).\n      4. Based on the decision criteria,\
    \ scope, and time constraints,\n      make a recommendation on which of the current\
    \ IPng candidates to\n      accept, if any.\n      Finally, I am asking Scott\
    \ and Allison to make a detailed report\n      at the opening plenary of the next\
    \ IETF meeting in November on the\n      status of setting up their new area,\
    \ and on their progress toward\n      organizing the above work items.  In particular,\
    \ the status of the\n      work items on timeframe should be fully reported. This\
    \ will be\n      followed by regular progress reports to the Internet community,\
    \ at\n      IETF meetings and in other appropriate forums.\n   Please join me\
    \ in giving Scott and Allison our full cooperation, and\n   in thanking them for\
    \ accepting this daunting assignment.  I feel\n   confident that we will now make\
    \ significant progress on the important\n   IPng issues facing the Internet community.\n"
