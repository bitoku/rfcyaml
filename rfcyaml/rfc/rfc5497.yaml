  - "1.  Introduction\n   The generalized packet/message format [RFC5444] specifies
    a signaling\n   format that MANET routing protocols can employ for exchanging\n
    \  protocol information.  This format presents the ability to express\n   and
    associate attributes to packets, messages, or addresses, by way\n   of a general
    TLV (type-length-value) mechanism.\n   This document specifies a general Time
    TLV structure, which can be\n   used by any MANET routing protocol that needs
    to express either\n   single time-values or a set of time-values with each time-value\n
    \  associated with a range of hop counts, as provided by the Message\n   Header
    of [RFC5444].  This allows a receiving node to determine a\n   single time-value
    if either it knows its hop count from the\n   originator node or the Time TLV
    specifies a single time-value.\n   A time-value is, in this context, not an \"absolute
    point in time\",\n   but rather an interval or a duration.  An instance of a Time
    TLV can,\n   therefore, express an interval or a duration such as \"10 seconds\".\n
    \  This document also specifies two Message TLV Types, which use the TLV\n   structure
    proposed.  These TLV Types are INTERVAL_TIME and\n   VALIDITY_TIME, specifying,
    respectively, the maximum time before\n   another message of the same type as
    this message from the same\n   originator should be received, and the duration
    for which the\n   information in this message is valid after receipt.  Note that,
    if\n   both are present, then the latter will usually be greater than the\n   former
    in order to allow for possible message loss.\n   This document also specifies
    two Address Block TLV Types, which use\n   the TLV structure proposed.  These
    TLV Types are INTERVAL_TIME and\n   VALIDITY_TIME, defined equivalently to the
    two Message TLVs with the\n   same names.\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Motivation and Rationale\n   The Time TLV structure, specified in this
      document, is intended to be\n   used as a component in a MANET routing protocol,
      e.g., to indicate\n   the expected spacing between successive transmissions
      of a given\n   Message Type, by including a Time TLV in transmitted messages.\n
      \  Some MANET routing protocols may employ very short spacing for some\n   messages
      and very long spacing for others, or may change the message\n   transmission
      rate according to observed behavior.  For example, if a\n   network is observed
      at some point in time to exhibit a highly dynamic\n   topology, a very short
      (sub-second) message spacing could be\n   appropriate, whereas if the network
      later is observed to stabilize,\n   multi-hour message spacing may become appropriate.
      \ Different MANET\n   routing protocols and different deployments of MANET routing\n
      \  protocols may have different granularity requirements and bounds on\n   shortest
      and longest spacing between successive message\n   transmissions.\n   In addition,
      MANET routing protocol deployments typically use\n   bandwidth-limited wireless
      network interfaces, and therefore prefer\n   to trade off computational complexity
      for a saving in the number of\n   bits transmitted.  This is practical in this
      case, because the\n   intended usages of Time TLVs, including the specified
      examples of\n   message interval time and information validity time, do not
      require\n   high-precision values of time.\n   The Time TLV structure, specified
      in this document, caters to these\n   characteristics by:\n   o  encoding time-values,
      such as an interval or a duration, in an\n      8-bit field; while\n   o  allowing
      these time-values to range from \"very small\" (e.g.,\n      1/1024 second)
      to \"very long\" (e.g., 45 days); and\n   o  allowing a MANET routing protocol,
      or a deployment, to\n      parameterize this (e.g., to attain finer granularity
      at the\n      expense of a lower upper bound) through a single parameter, C.\n
      \  The parameter C must be the same for all MANET routers in the same\n   deployment.\n
      \  The TLV mechanism as specified in [RFC5444] allows associating a\n   \"value\"
      to either a packet, a message, or to addresses.  The data\n   structure for
      doing so -- the TLV -- is identical in each of the\n   three cases; however,
      the TLV's position in a received packet allows\n   determining if that TLV is
      a \"Packet TLV\" (it appears in the Packet\n   Header, before any messages),
      a \"Message TLV\" (it appears in the TLV\n   Block immediately following a Message
      Header), or an \"Address Block\n   TLV\" (it appears in the TLV Block immediately
      following an Address\n   Block).\n   While TLVs may be structurally identical,
      that which they express may\n   be different.  This is determined from the kind
      (packet, message, or\n   Address Block) and type of the TLV.  For example, one
      TLV might\n   associate a lifetime to an address, another a content sequence
      number\n   to a message, and another a cryptographic signature to a packet.
      \ For\n   this reason, [RFC5444] specifies separate registries for Packet TLV\n
      \  Types, Message TLV Types, and Address Block TLV Types, and it does\n   not
      specify any structure in the TLV Value field.\n   The TLVs defined in this document
      express, essentially, that \"this\n   information will be refreshed within X
      seconds\" and that \"this\n   information is valid for X seconds after being
      received\", each\n   allowing the \"X seconds\" to be specified as a function
      of the number\n   of hops from the originator of the information.  This document\n
      \  specifies a general format allowing expressing and encoding this as\n   the
      value field of a TLV.  This representation uses a compact (8-bit)\n   representation
      of time, as message size is an issue in many MANETs,\n   and the offered precision
      and range is appropriate for MANET routing\n   protocols.\n   A TLV of this
      format may be used for packets, messages, or addresses.\n   For example, a proactive
      MANET routing protocol periodically\n   reporting link-state information could
      include a TLV of this format\n   as a Message TLV.  This may indicate a different
      periodicity in\n   different scopes (possibly frequently up to a few hops, less\n
      \  frequently beyond that) because some messages may be sent with\n   limited
      scope, as specified in [RFC5444].  A reactive MANET routing\n   protocol could
      include a TLV of this format as an Address Block TLV\n   for reporting the lifetime
      of routes to individual addresses.\n   In addition to defining the general format
      as outlined above, this\n   document requests IANA assignments for INTERVAL_TIME
      and\n   VALIDITY_TIME TLVs.  These IANA assignments are requested in this\n
      \  document in order to avoid interdependencies between otherwise\n   unrelated
      MANET protocols and in order to not exhaust the TLV Type\n   spaces by having
      different protocols request types for essentially\n   identical data structures.
      \ Only Message TLVs and Address Block TLVs\n   are requested, as these are those
      for which a need has been\n   demonstrated.\n"

  - "4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning\n   This document does not specify a protocol
    nor does it mandate\n   specific node or protocol behavior.  Rather, it outlines
    mechanisms\n   for encoding time-values using the TLV mechanism of [RFC5444].\n"
  title: 4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning
- contents:
  - "5.  Representing Time\n   This document specifies a TLV structure in which time-values
    are each\n   represented in an 8-bit time-code, one or more of which may be used\n
    \  in a TLV's <value> field.  Of these 8 bits, the least significant 3\n   bits
    represent the mantissa (a), and the most significant 5 bits\n   represent the
    exponent (b), so that:\n   o  time-value := (1 + a/8) * 2^b * C\n   o  time-code
    := 8 * b + a\n   All nodes in the MANET MUST use the same value of the constant
    C,\n   which will be specified in seconds, hence so will be all time-values.\n
    \  C MUST be greater than 0 seconds.  Note that ascending values of the\n   time-code
    represent ascending time-values; time-values may thus be\n   compared by comparison
    of time-codes.\n   An algorithm for computing the time-code representing the smallest\n
    \  representable time-value not less than the time-value t is:\n   1.  find the
    largest integer b such that t/C >= 2^b;\n   2.  set a := 8 * (t / (C * 2^b) -
    1), rounded up to the nearest\n       integer;\n   3.  if a = 8, then set b :=
    b + 1 and set a := 0;\n   4.  if 0 <= a <= 7, and 0 <= b <= 31, then the required
    time-value\n       can be represented by the time-code 8 * b + a, otherwise it\n
    \      cannot.\n   The minimum time-value that can be represented in this manner
    is C.\n   The maximum time-value that can be represented in this manner is 15
    *\n   2^28 * C, or about 4.0 * 10^9 * C.  If, for example, C = 1/1024\n   second,
    then this is about 45 days.\n   A protocol using this time representation MUST
    define the value of C.\n   A protocol using this specification MAY specify that
    the all-bits\n   zero time-value (0) represents a time-value of zero and/or that
    the\n   all-bits one time-value (255) represents an indefinitely large time-\n
    \  value.\n"

  - "6.  General Time TLV Structure\n   The following data structure allows the representation
    of a single\n   time-value, or of a default time-value plus pairs of (time-values,\n
    \  hop counts) for when hop-count-dependent time-values are required.\n   The
    time-values are represented as time-codes as defined in\n   Section 5.  This <time-data>
    data structure is specified, using the\n   regular expression syntax of [RFC5444],
    by:\n       <time-data> = (<time-code><hop-count>)*<time-code>\n   where:\n   <time-code>
    \ is an 8-bit unsigned integer field containing a time-\n      code as defined
    in Section 5.\n   <hop-count>  is an 8-bit unsigned integer field specifying a
    hop\n      count from the message originator.\n   A <time-data> structure thus
    consists of an odd number of octets;\n   with a repetition factor of n for the
    (time, hop count) pairs in the\n   regular expression syntax, it contains 2n+1
    octets.  On reception, n\n   is determined from the length.\n   A <time-data>
    field may be thus represented by:\n       <t_1><d_1><t_2><d_2> ... <t_i><d_i>
    ...  <t_n><d_n><t_default>\n   <d_1>, ... <d_n>, if present, MUST be a strictly
    increasing sequence,\n   with <d_n> < 255.  Then, at the receiving node's hop
    count from the\n   originator node, the time-value indicated is that represented
    by the\n   time-code:\n   o  <t_1>, if n > 0 and hop count <= <d_1>;\n   o  <t_i+1>,
    if n > 1 and <d_i> < hop count <= <d_i+1> for some i such\n      that 1 <= i <
    n;\n   o  <t_default> otherwise, i.e. if n = 0 or hop count > <d_n>.\n   If included
    in a message without a <msg-hop-count> field in its\n   Message Header, or in
    a Packet TLV, then the form of this data\n   structure with a single time-code
    in <time-data> (i.e., n = 0) SHOULD\n   be used.\n"

  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies how to add data structures
    (TLVs) that\n   provide timing information to packets and messages specified using\n
    \  [RFC5444].  In particular, information validity durations and\n   reporting
    intervals may be added.\n   The general security threats that apply are those
    general to\n   [RFC5444] and described therein, problems of integrity and\n   confidentiality.
    \ With regard to the former, modification of a Time\n   TLV can cause information
    to have an invalid validity time, or\n   expected interval time.  This may cause
    incorrect protocol\n   performance.  Modification or addition of timed information
    can add\n   to a protocol's workload (especially if a short validity time is\n
    \  specified) and storage requirements (especially if a long validity\n   time
    is specified).\n   To counter these threats, the security suggestions in [RFC5444],
    for\n   the use of authentication and encryption, are appropriate.\n"
