  - "                   A DoD Statement on the NRC Report\nSTATUS OF THIS MEMO\n \
    \  This RFC reproduces a letter from the Assistant Secretary of Defense\n   for\
    \ Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASDC3I) to\n   the Director\
    \ of the Defense Communications Agency (DCA).  This letter\n   is distributed\
    \ for information only.  Distribution of this memo is\n   unlimited.\nCONTEXT\n\
    \   In December 1978, the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for\n  \
    \ Research and Engineering, Gerald P. Dinneen, USDR&E, issued a\n   memorandum\
    \ mandating the use of TCP/IP for all packet-oriented data\n   networks where\
    \ there is potential for host-to-host connectivity\n   across network or subnetwork\
    \ boundaries, and designating the Defense\n   Communications Agency as the DoD\
    \ Executive Agent for computer\n   communications protocols (see IEN-152).\n \
    \  In April 1980, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Communications,\n   Command,\
    \ Control, and Intelligence, Gerald P. Dinneen, ASDC3I, issued\n   a memorandum\
    \ reaffirming the requirement of TCP/IP, confirming the\n   role of DCA as the\
    \ Executive Agent, and approving a plan for the\n   organization and activities\
    \ of the Executive Agent (see IEN-152).\n   In March 1982, Richard D. DeLauer,\
    \ ASDC3I, issued a memorandum\n   reaffirming the requirement for the use of TCP/IP,\
    \ and reaffirming\n   the role of DCA as Executive Agent (see IEN-207).\n   However,\
    \ there is also a DoD policy of long standing to use non-DoD\n   standards when\
    \ such standards are available and meet the military\n   requirements.  This policy\
    \ is cited in DeLauer's memorandum.\n   Because questions were raised about the\
    \ DoD use of TCP/IP as a\n   protocol standard, while the ISO is developing an\
    \ differing set of\n   standards, and the NBS is working toward establishing the\
    \ ISO\n   standards as FIPS, in May 1983 the National Research Council (NRC)\n\
    \   was asked jointly by DoD and NBS to study the issues and recommend a\n   course\
    \ of action.  The final report of the NRC committee was\n   published in February\
    \ 1985 (see RFC-942).\n   The enclosed letter is from Donald C. Latham (ASDC3I)\
    \ to DCA\n   transmitting the NRC report and requesting specific actions relative\n\
    \   to the recommendations of the report.\nPostel                            \

    \                          April 1985\n                     Assistant Secretary\
    \ of Defense\n                     Washington, D.C.,  20301-3040\nCommand, Control,\n\
    Communications\n     and\nIntelligence\nMEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR, DEFENSE COMMUNICATIONS\
    \ AGENCY\nSUBJECT:  National Research Council Report on Transport Protocols for\n\
    \          DoD Data Networks\n     Attached is the final report on \"Transport\
    \ Protocols for Department\nof Defense Data Networks\" from the National Research\
    \ Council (Board on\nTelecommunications and Computer Applications, Commission\
    \ on Engineering\nand Technical Systems).  The report recommends that DoD immediately\n\
    adopt the International Standards Organization Transport Protocol (TP-4)\nand\
    \ Internetwork Protocol (IP) as a DoD co-standard to the current DoD\nstandard\
    \ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and IP and move ultimately\ntoward exclusive\
    \ use of TP-4.\n     Whenever international standards are available and can be\
    \ used to\nsupport military requirements, they will be implemented as rapidly\
    \ as\npossible to obtain maximum economic and interoperability benefits.\nHowever,\
    \ TP as a proven commercial offering is not available at this\ntime.  The progress\
    \ of TP will be monitored carefully and once\ncommercially available, TP will\
    \ be tested and evaluated for use in\nmilitary application.\n     In order to\
    \ insure that DoD is in a posture to evaluate TP once it\nis in wider use in the\
    \ commercial sector, request you initiate the\nfollowing actions:\n   (1)  develop\
    \ the DoD military requirement specification for TP to\n        insure that industry\
    \ is aware of DoD needs as TP is commercially\n        implemented.\n   (2)  insure\
    \ that appropriate advisory representation is provided to\n        commercial\
    \ standards working groups that are currently refining\n        TP under the auspices\
    \ of the National Bureau of Standards.\n   (3)  insure that the DCA protocol test\
    \ facility can accommodate TP\n        testing as required when commercial implementations\
    \ are\n        available.\n   (4)  develop a transition strategy for Option 2\
    \ of the report to\n        include estimated resource requirements.\n   (5) \
    \ evaluate the detailed recommendations presented in the Report\n        (pages\
    \ 61-64) as they apply to Option 2.\n"
