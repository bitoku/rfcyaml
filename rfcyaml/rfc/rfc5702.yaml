  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) is the global, hierarchical
    distributed\n   database for Internet Naming.  The DNS has been extended to use\n
    \  cryptographic keys and digital signatures for the verification of the\n   authenticity
    and integrity of its data.  [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and\n   [RFC4035] describe these
    DNS Security Extensions, called DNSSEC.\n   RFC 4034 describes how to store DNSKEY
    and RRSIG resource records,\n   and specifies a list of cryptographic algorithms
    to use.  This\n   document extends that list with the algorithms RSA/SHA-256 and
    RSA/\n   SHA-512, and specifies how to store DNSKEY data and how to produce\n
    \  RRSIG resource records with these hash algorithms.\n   Familiarity with DNSSEC,
    RSA, and the SHA-2 [FIPS.180-3.2008] family\n   of algorithms is assumed in this
    document.\n   To refer to both SHA-256 and SHA-512, this document will use the
    name\n   SHA-2.  This is done to improve readability.  When a part of text is\n
    \  specific for either SHA-256 or SHA-512, their specific names are\n   used.
    \ The same goes for RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/SHA-512, which will be\n   grouped using
    the name RSA/SHA-2.\n   The term \"SHA-2\" is not officially defined but is usually
    used to\n   refer to the collection of the algorithms SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384,\n
    \  and SHA-512.  Since SHA-224 and SHA-384 are not used in DNSSEC, SHA-2\n   will
    only refer to SHA-256 and SHA-512 in this document.\n   The key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD
    NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to
    be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"

    RR follows the RSASSA-\n   PKCS1-v1_5 signature scheme and is calculated as follows.
    \ The values\n   for the RDATA fields that precede the signature data are specified
    in\n   [RFC4034].\n   hash = SHA-XXX(data)\n   Here XXX is either 256 or 512,
    depending on the algorithm used, as\n   specified in FIPS PUB 180-3; \"data\"
    is the wire format data of the\n   resource record set that is signed, as specified
    in [RFC4034].\n   signature = ( 00 | 01 | FF* | 00 | prefix | hash ) ** e (mod
    n)\n   Here \"|\" is concatenation; \"00\", \"01\", \"FF\", and \"00\" are fixed\n
    \  octets of corresponding hexadecimal value; \"e\" is the private\n   exponent
    of the signing RSA key; and \"n\" is the public modulus of the\n   signing key.
    \ The FF octet MUST be repeated the exact number of times\n   so that the total
    length of the concatenated term in parentheses\n   equals the length of the modulus
    of the signer's public key (\"n\").\n   The \"prefix\" is intended to make the
    use of standard cryptographic\n   libraries easier.  These specifications are
    taken directly from the\n   specifications of RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 in PKCS #1 v2.1
    (Section 8.2 of\n   [RFC3447]), and EMSA-PKCS1-v1_5 encoding in PKCS #1 v2.1 (Section
