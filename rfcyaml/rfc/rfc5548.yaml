  - "Abstract\n   The application-specific routing requirements for Urban Low-Power\
    \ and\n   Lossy Networks (U-LLNs) are presented in this document.  In the near\n\
    \   future, sensing and actuating nodes will be placed outdoors in urban\n   environments\
    \ so as to improve people's living conditions as well as\n   to monitor compliance\
    \ with increasingly strict environmental laws.\n   These field nodes are expected\
    \ to measure and report a wide gamut of\n   data (for example, the data required\
    \ by applications that perform\n   smart-metering or that monitor meteorological,\
    \ pollution, and allergy\n   conditions).  The majority of these nodes are expected\
    \ to communicate\n   wirelessly over a variety of links such as IEEE 802.15.4,\
    \ low-power\n   IEEE 802.11, or IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), which given the limited\n\
    \   radio range and the large number of nodes requires the use of\n   suitable\
    \ routing protocols.  The design of such protocols will be\n   mainly impacted\
    \ by the limited resources of the nodes (memory,\n   processing power, battery,\
    \ etc.) and the particularities of the\n   outdoor urban application scenarios.\
    \  As such, for a wireless\n   solution for Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy (ROLL)\
    \ networks to be\n   useful, the protocol(s) ought to be energy-efficient, scalable,\
    \ and\n   autonomous.  This documents aims to specify a set of IPv6 routing\n\
    \   requirements reflecting these and further U-LLNs' tailored\n   characteristics.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Canonical Network Elements
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Canonical Network Elements\n   A U-LLN is understood to be a network composed\
    \ of three key elements,\n   i.e.,\n   1.  sensors,\n   2.  actuators, and\n \
    \  3.  routers\n   that communicate wirelessly.  The aim of the following sections\n\
    \   (3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.3) is to illustrate the functional nature of a\n  \
    \ sensor, actuator, and router in this context.  That said, it must be\n   understood\
    \ that these functionalities are not exclusive.  A\n   particular device may act\
    \ as a simple router or may alternatively be\n   a router equipped with a sensing\
    \ functionality, in which case it will\n   be seen as a \"regular\" router as\
    \ far as routing is concerned.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Sensors
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Sensors\n   Sensing nodes measure a wide gamut of physical data, including\
    \ but\n   not limited to:\n   1.  municipal consumption data, such as smart-metering\
    \ of gas, water,\n       electricity, waste, etc.;\n   2.  meteorological data,\
    \ such as temperature, pressure, humidity, UV\n       index, strength and direction\
    \ of wind, etc.;\n   3.  pollution data, such as gases (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen\
    \ oxide,\n       carbon monoxide, ozone), heavy metals (e.g., mercury), pH,\n\
    \       radioactivity, etc.;\n   4.  ambient data, such as levels of allergens\
    \ (pollen, dust),\n       electromagnetic pollution, noise, etc.\n   Sensor nodes\
    \ run applications that typically gather the measurement\n   data and send it\
    \ to data collection and processing application(s) on\n   other node(s) (often\
    \ outside the U-LLN).\n   Sensor nodes are capable of forwarding data.  Sensor\
    \ nodes are\n   generally not mobile in the majority of near-future roll-outs.\
    \  In\n   many anticipated roll-outs, sensor nodes may suffer from long-term\n\
    \   resource constraints.\n   A prominent example is a \"smart grid\" application\
    \ that consists of a\n   city-wide network of smart meters and distribution monitoring\n\
    \   sensors.  Smart meters in an urban \"smart grid\" application will\n   include\
    \ electric, gas, and/or water meters typically administered by\n   one or multiple\
    \ utility companies.  These meters will be capable of\n   advanced sensing functionalities\
    \ such as measuring the quality of\n   electrical service provided to a customer,\
    \ providing granular\n   interval data, or automating the detection of alarm conditions.\
    \  In\n   addition, they may be capable of advanced interactive\n   functionalities,\
    \ which may invoke an actuator component, such as\n   remote service disconnect\
    \ or remote demand reset.  More advanced\n   scenarios include demand response\
    \ systems for managing peak load, and\n   distribution automation systems to monitor\
    \ the infrastructure that\n   delivers energy throughout the urban environment.\
    \  Sensor nodes\n   capable of providing this type of functionality may sometimes\
    \ be\n   referred to as Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI).\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Actuators
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Actuators\n   Actuator nodes are capable of controlling urban devices;\
    \ examples are\n   street or traffic lights.  They run applications that receive\n\
    \   instructions from control applications on other nodes (possibly\n   outside\
    \ the U-LLN).  The amount of actuator points is well below the\n   number of sensing\
    \ nodes.  Some sensing nodes may include an actuator\n   component, e.g., an electric\
    \ meter node with integrated support for\n   remote service disconnect.  Actuators\
    \ are capable of forwarding data.\n   Actuators are not likely to be mobile in\
    \ the majority of near-future\n   roll-outs.  Actuator nodes may also suffer from\
    \ long-term resource\n   constraints, e.g., in the case where they are battery\
    \ powered.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  Routers
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  Routers\n   Routers generally act to close coverage and routing gaps\
    \ within the\n   interior of the U-LLN; examples of their use are:\n   1.  prolong\
    \ the U-LLN's lifetime,\n   2.  balance nodes' energy depletion, and\n   3.  build\
    \ advanced sensing infrastructures.\n   There can be several routers supporting\
    \ the same U-LLN; however, the\n   number of routers is well below the amount\
    \ of sensing nodes.  The\n   routers are generally not mobile, i.e., fixed to\
    \ a random or pre-\n   planned location.  Routers may, but generally do not, suffer\
    \ from any\n   form of (long-term) resource constraint, except that they need\
    \ to be\n   small and sufficiently cheap.  Routers differ from actuator and\n\
    \   sensing nodes in that they neither control nor sense.  That being\n   said,\
    \ a sensing node or actuator may also be a router within the\n   U-LLN.\n   Some\
    \ routers provide access to wider infrastructures, such as the\n   Internet, and\
    \ are named Low-Power and Lossy Network Border Routers\n   (LBRs) in that context.\n\
    \   LBR nodes in particular may also run applications that communicate\n   with\
    \ sensor and actuator nodes (e.g., collecting and processing data\n   from sensor\
    \ applications, or sending instructions to actuator\n   applications).\n"
- title: 3.2.  Topology
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Topology\n   Whilst millions of sensing nodes may very well be deployed\
    \ in an\n   urban area, they are likely to be associated with more than one\n\
    \   network.  These networks may or may not communicate between one\n   another.\
    \  The number of sensing nodes deployed in the urban\n   environment in support\
    \ of some applications is expected to be in the\n   order of 10^2 to 10^7; this\
    \ is still very large and unprecedented in\n   current roll-outs.\n   Deployment\
    \ of nodes is likely to happen in batches, e.g., boxes of\n   hundreds to thousands\
    \ of nodes arrive and are deployed.  The location\n   of the nodes is random within\
    \ given topological constraints, e.g.,\n   placement along a road, river, or at\
    \ individual residences.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Resource Constraints
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Resource Constraints\n   The nodes are highly resource constrained, i.e.,\
    \ cheap hardware, low\n   memory, and no infinite energy source.  Different node\
    \ powering\n   mechanisms are available, such as:\n   1.  non-rechargeable battery;\n\
    \   2.  rechargeable battery with regular recharging (e.g., sunlight);\n   3.\
    \  rechargeable battery with irregular recharging (e.g.,\n       opportunistic\
    \ energy scavenging);\n   4.  capacitive/inductive energy provision (e.g., passive\
    \ Radio\n       Frequency IDentification (RFID));\n   5.  always on (e.g., powered\
    \ electricity meter).\n   In the case of a battery-powered sensing node, the battery\
    \ shelf life\n   is usually in the order of 10 to 15 years, rendering network\
    \ lifetime\n   maximization with battery-powered nodes beyond this lifespan useless.\n\
    \   The physical and electromagnetic distances between the three key\n   elements,\
    \ i.e., sensors, actuators, and routers, can generally be\n   very large, i.e.,\
    \ from several hundreds of meters to one kilometer.\n   Not every field node is\
    \ likely to reach the LBR in a single hop,\n   thereby requiring suitable routing\
    \ protocols that manage the\n   information flow in an energy-efficient manner.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Link Reliability
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Link Reliability\n   The links between the network elements are volatile\
    \ due to the\n   following set of non-exclusive effects:\n   1.  packet errors\
    \ due to wireless channel effects;\n   2.  packet errors due to MAC (Medium Access\
    \ Control) (e.g.,\n       collision);\n   3.  packet errors due to interference\
    \ from other systems;\n   4.  link unavailability due to network dynamicity; etc.\n\
    \   The wireless channel causes the received power to drop below a given\n   threshold\
    \ in a random fashion, thereby causing detection errors in\n   the receiving node.\
    \  The underlying effects are path loss, shadowing\n   and fading.\n   Since the\
    \ wireless medium is broadcast in nature, nodes in their\n   communication radios\
    \ require suitable medium access control protocols\n   that are capable of resolving\
    \ any arising contention.  Some available\n   protocols may not be able to prevent\
    \ packets of neighboring nodes\n   from colliding, possibly leading to a high\
    \ Packet Error Rate (PER)\n   and causing a link outage.\n   Furthermore, the\
    \ outdoor deployment of U-LLNs also has implications\n   for the interference\
    \ temperature and hence link reliability and range\n   if Industrial, Scientific,\
    \ and Medical (ISM) bands are to be used.\n   For instance, if the 2.4 GHz ISM\
    \ band is used to facilitate\n   communication between U-LLN nodes, then heavily\
    \ loaded Wireless Local\n   Area Network (WLAN) hot-spots may become a detrimental\
    \ performance\n   factor, leading to high PER and jeopardizing the functioning\
    \ of the\n   U-LLN.\n   Finally, nodes appearing and disappearing causes dynamics\
    \ in the\n   network that can yield link outages and changes of topologies.\n"
- title: 4.  Urban LLN Application Scenarios
  contents:
  - "4.  Urban LLN Application Scenarios\n   Urban applications represent a special\
    \ segment of LLNs with its\n   unique set of requirements.  To facilitate the\
    \ requirements\n   discussion in Section 6, this section lists a few typical but\
    \ not\n   exhaustive deployment problems and usage cases of U-LLN.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Deployment of Nodes
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Deployment of Nodes\n   Contrary to other LLN applications, deployment\
    \ of nodes is likely to\n   happen in batches out of a box.  Typically, hundreds\
    \ to thousands of\n   nodes are being shipped by the manufacturer with pre-programmed\n\
    \   functionalities which are then rolled-out by a service provider or\n   subcontracted\
    \ entities.  Prior to or after roll-out, the network\n   needs to be ramped-up.\
    \  This initialization phase may include, among\n   others, allocation of addresses,\
    \ (possibly hierarchical) roles in the\n   network, synchronization, determination\
    \ of schedules, etc.\n   If initialization is performed prior to roll-out, all\
    \ nodes are\n   likely to be in one another's one-hop radio neighborhood.  Pre-\n\
    \   programmed Media Access Control (MAC) and routing protocols may hence\n  \
    \ fail to function properly, thereby wasting a large amount of energy.\n   Whilst\
    \ the major burden will be on resolving MAC conflicts, any\n   proposed U-LLN\
    \ routing protocol needs to cater for such a case.  For\n   instance, zero-configuration\
    \ and network address allocation needs to\n   be properly supported, etc.\n  \
    \ After roll-out, nodes will have a finite set of one-hop neighbors,\n   likely\
    \ of low cardinality (in the order of 5 to 10).  However, some\n   nodes may be\
    \ deployed in areas where there are hundreds of\n   neighboring devices.  In the\
    \ resulting topology, there may be regions\n   where many (redundant) paths are\
    \ possible through the network.  Other\n   regions may be dependent on critical\
    \ links to achieve connectivity\n   with the rest of the network.  Any proposed\
    \ LLN routing protocol\n   ought to support the autonomous self-organization and\
    \ self-\n   configuration of the network at lowest possible energy cost [Lu2007],\n\
    \   where autonomy is understood to be the ability of the network to\n   operate\
    \ without external influence.  The result of such organization\n   should be that\
    \ each node or set of nodes is uniquely addressable so\n   as to facilitate the\
    \ set up of schedules, etc.\n   Unless exceptionally needed, broadcast forwarding\
    \ schemes are not\n   advised in urban sensor networking environments.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Association and Disassociation/Disappearance of Nodes
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Association and Disassociation/Disappearance of Nodes\n   After the initialization\
    \ phase and possibly some operational time,\n   new nodes may be injected into\
    \ the network as well as existing nodes\n   removed from the network.  The former\
    \ might be because a removed node\n   is replaced as part of maintenance, or new\
    \ nodes are added because\n   more sensors for denser readings/actuations are\
    \ needed, or because\n   routing protocols report connectivity problems.  The\
    \ latter might be\n   because a node's battery is depleted, the node is removed\
    \ for\n   maintenance, the node is stolen or accidentally destroyed, etc.\n  \
    \ The protocol(s) hence should be able to convey information about\n   malfunctioning\
    \ nodes that may affect or jeopardize the overall\n   routing efficiency, so that\
    \ self-organization and self-configuration\n   capabilities of the sensor network\
    \ might be solicited to facilitate\n   the appropriate reconfiguration.  This\
    \ information may include, e.g.,\n   exact or relative geographical position,\
    \ etc.  The reconfiguration\n   may include the change of hierarchies, routing\
    \ paths, packet\n   forwarding schedules, etc.  Furthermore, to inform the LBR(s)\
    \ of the\n   node's arrival and association with the network as well as freshly\n\
    \   associated nodes about packet forwarding schedules, roles, etc.,\n   appropriate\
    \ updating mechanisms should be supported.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Regular Measurement Reporting
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Regular Measurement Reporting\n   The majority of sensing nodes will be\
    \ configured to report their\n   readings on a regular basis.  The frequency of\
    \ data sensing and\n   reporting may be different but is generally expected to\
    \ be fairly\n   low, i.e., in the range of once per hour, per day, etc.  The ratio\n\
    \   between data sensing and reporting frequencies will determine the\n   memory\
    \ and data aggregation capabilities of the nodes.  Latency of an\n   end-to-end\
    \ delivery and acknowledgements of a successful data\n   delivery may not be vital\
    \ as sensing outages can be observed at data\n   collection applications -- when,\
    \ for instance, there is no reading\n   arriving from a given sensor or cluster\
    \ of sensors within a day.  In\n   this case, a query can be launched to check\
    \ upon the state and\n   availability of a sensing node or sensing cluster.\n\
    \   It is not uncommon to gather data on a few servers located outside of\n  \
    \ the U-LLN.  In such cases, a large number of highly directional\n   unicast\
    \ flows from the sensing nodes or sensing clusters are likely\n   to transit through\
    \ a LBR.  Thus, the protocol(s) should be optimized\n   to support a large number\
    \ of unicast flows from the sensing nodes or\n   sensing clusters towards a LBR,\
    \ or highly directed multicast or\n   anycast flows from the nodes towards multiple\
    \ LBRs.\n   Route computation and selection may depend on the transmitted\n  \
    \ information, the frequency of reporting, the amount of energy\n   remaining\
    \ in the nodes, the recharging pattern of energy-scavenged\n   nodes, etc.  For\
    \ instance, temperature readings could be reported\n   every hour via one set\
    \ of battery-powered nodes, whereas air quality\n   indicators are reported only\
    \ during the daytime via nodes powered by\n   solar energy.  More generally, entire\
    \ routing areas may be avoided\n   (e.g., at night) but heavily used during the\
    \ day when nodes are\n   scavenging energy from sunlight.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Queried Measurement Reporting
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Queried Measurement Reporting\n   Occasionally, network-external data queries\
    \ can be launched by one or\n   several applications.  For instance, it is desirable\
    \ to know the\n   level of pollution at a specific point or along a given road\
    \ in the\n   urban environment.  The queries' rates of occurrence are not regular\n\
    \   but rather random, where heavy-tail distributions seem appropriate to\n  \
    \ model their behavior.  Queries do not necessarily need to be reported\n   back\
    \ to the same node from where the query was launched.  Round-trip\n   times, i.e.,\
    \ from the launch of a query from a node until the\n   delivery of the measured\
    \ data to a node, are of importance.  However,\n   they are not very stringent\
    \ where latencies should simply be\n   sufficiently smaller than typical reporting\
    \ intervals; for instance,\n   in the order of seconds or minutes.  The routing\
    \ protocol(s) should\n   consider the selection of paths with appropriate (e.g.,\
    \ latency)\n   metrics to support queried measurement reporting.  To facilitate\
    \ the\n   query process, U-LLN devices should support unicast and multicast\n\

- title: 4.5.  Alert Reporting
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Alert Reporting\n   Rarely, the sensing nodes will measure an event that\
    \ classifies as an\n   alarm where such a classification is typically done locally\
    \ within\n   each node by means of a pre-programmed or prior-diffused threshold.\n\
    \   Note that on approaching the alert threshold level, nodes may wish to\n  \
    \ change their sensing and reporting cycles.  An alarm is likely being\n   registered\
    \ by a plurality of sensing nodes where the delivery of a\n   single alert message\
    \ with its location of origin suffices in most,\n   but not all, cases.  One example\
    \ of alert reporting is if the level\n   of toxic gases rises above a threshold;\
    \ thereupon, the sensing nodes\n   in the vicinity of this event report the danger.\
    \  Another example of\n   alert reporting is when a recycling glass container\
    \ -- equipped with\n   a sensor measuring its level of occupancy -- reports that\
    \ the\n   container is full and hence needs to be emptied.\n   Routes clearly\
    \ need to be unicast (towards one LBR) or multicast\n   (towards multiple LBRs).\
    \  Delays and latencies are important;\n   however, for a U-LLN deployed in support\
    \ of a typical application,\n   deliveries within seconds should suffice in most\
    \ of the cases.\n"
- title: 5.  Traffic Pattern
  contents:
  - "5.  Traffic Pattern\n   Unlike traditional ad hoc networks, the information flow\
    \ in U-LLNs is\n   highly directional.  There are three main flows to be distinguished:\n\
    \   1.  sensed information from the sensing nodes to applications outside\n  \
    \     the U-LLN, going through one or a subset of the LBR(s);\n   2.  query requests\
    \ from applications outside the U-LLN, going through\n       the LBR(s) towards\
    \ the sensing nodes;\n   3.  control information from applications outside the\
    \ U-LLN, going\n       through the LBR(s) towards the actuators.\n   Some of the\
    \ flows may need the reverse route for delivering\n   acknowledgements.  Finally,\
    \ in the future, some direct information\n   flows between field devices without\
    \ LBRs may also occur.\n   Sensed data is likely to be highly correlated in space,\
    \ time, and\n   observed events; an example of the latter is when temperature\n\
    \   increase and humidity decrease as the day commences.  Data may be\n   sensed\
    \ and delivered at different rates with both rates being\n   typically fairly\
    \ low, i.e., in the range of minutes, hours, days,\n   etc.  Data may be delivered\
    \ regularly according to a schedule or a\n   regular query; it may also be delivered\
    \ irregularly after an\n   externally triggered query; it may also be triggered\
    \ after a sudden\n   network-internal event or alert.  Schedules may be driven\
    \ by, for\n   example, a smart-metering application where data is expected to\
    \ be\n   delivered every hour, or an environmental monitoring application\n  \
    \ where a battery-powered node is expected to report its status at a\n   specific\
    \ time once a day.  Data delivery may trigger acknowledgements\n   or maintenance\
    \ traffic in the reverse direction.  The network hence\n   needs to be able to\
    \ adjust to the varying activity duty cycles, as\n   well as to periodic and sporadic\
    \ traffic.  Also, sensed data ought to\n   be secured and locatable.\n   Some\
    \ data delivery may have tight latency requirements, for example,\n   in a case\
    \ such as a live meter reading for customer service in a\n   smart-metering application,\
    \ or in a case where a sensor reading\n   response must arrive within a certain\
    \ time in order to be useful.\n   The network should take into consideration that\
    \ different application\n   traffic may require different priorities in the selection\
    \ of a route\n   when traversing the network, and that some traffic may be more\n\
    \   sensitive to latency.\n   A U-LLN should support occasional large-scale traffic\
    \ flows from\n   sensing nodes through LBRs (to nodes outside the U-LLN), such\
    \ as\n   system-wide alerts.  In the example of an AMI U-LLN, this could be in\n\
    \   response to events such as a city-wide power outage.  In this\n   scenario,\
    \ all powered devices in a large segment of the network may\n   have lost power\
    \ and be running off of a temporary \"last gasp\" source\n   such as a capacitor\
    \ or small battery.  A node must be able to send\n   its own alerts toward an\
    \ LBR while continuing to forward traffic on\n   behalf of other devices that\
    \ are also experiencing an alert\n   condition.  The network needs to be able\
    \ to manage this sudden large\n   traffic flow.\n   A U-LLN may also need to support\
    \ efficient large-scale messaging to\n   groups of actuators.  For example, an\
    \ AMI U-LLN supporting a city-\n   wide demand response system will need to efficiently\
    \ broadcast\n   demand-response control information to a large subset of actuators\
    \ in\n   the system.\n   Some scenarios will require internetworking between the\
    \ U-LLN and\n   another network, such as a home network.  For example, an AMI\n\
    \   application that implements a demand-response system may need to\n   forward\
    \ traffic from a utility, across the U-LLN, into a home\n   automation network.\
    \  A typical use case would be to inform a customer\n   of incentives to reduce\
    \ demand during peaks, or to automatically\n   adjust the thermostat of customers\
    \ who have enrolled in such a demand\n   management program.  Subsequent traffic\
    \ may be triggered to flow back\n   through the U-LLN to the utility.\n"

    \ security threats that\n   need to be addressed.  The wireless and distributed\
    \ nature of these\n   networks increases the spectrum of potential routing security\n\
    \   threats.  This is further amplified by the resource constraints of\n   the\
    \ nodes, thereby preventing resource-intensive routing security\n   approaches\
    \ from being deployed.  A viable routing security approach\n   SHOULD be sufficiently\
    \ lightweight that it may be implemented across\n   all nodes in a U-LLN.  These\
    \ issues require special attention during\n   the design process, so as to facilitate\
    \ a commercially attractive\n   deployment.\n   The U-LLN MUST deny any node that\
    \ has not been authenticated to the\n   U-LLN and authorized to participate to\
    \ the routing decision process.\n   An attacker SHOULD be prevented from manipulating\
    \ or disabling the\n   routing function, for example, by compromising routing\
    \ control\n   messages.  To this end, the routing protocol(s) MUST support message\n\
    \   integrity.\n   Further examples of routing security issues that may arise\
    \ are the\n   abnormal behavior of nodes that exhibit an egoistic conduct, such\
    \ as\n   not obeying network rules or forwarding no or false packets.  Other\n\
    \   important issues may arise in the context of denial-of-service (DoS)\n   attacks,\
    \ malicious address space allocations, advertisement of\n   variable addresses,\
    \ a wrong neighborhood, etc.  The routing\n   protocol(s) SHOULD support defense\
    \ against DoS attacks and other\n   attempts to maliciously or inadvertently cause\
    \ the mechanisms of the\n   routing protocol(s) to over-consume the limited resources\
    \ of LLN\n   nodes, e.g., by constructing forwarding loops or causing excessive\n\
    \   routing protocol overhead traffic, etc.\n   The properties of self-configuration\
    \ and self-organization that are\n   desirable in a U-LLN introduce additional\
    \ routing security\n   considerations.  Mechanisms MUST be in place to deny any\
    \ node that\n   attempts to take malicious advantage of self-configuration and\
    \ self-\n   organization procedures.  Such attacks may attempt, for example, to\n\
    \   cause DoS, drain the energy of power-constrained devices, or to\n   hijack\
    \ the routing mechanism.  A node MUST authenticate itself to a\n   trusted node\
    \ that is already associated with the U-LLN before the\n   former can take part\
    \ in self-configuration or self-organization.  A\n   node that has already authenticated\
    \ and associated with the U-LLN\n   MUST deny, to the maximum extent possible,\
    \ the allocation of\n   resources to any unauthenticated peer.  The routing protocol(s)\
    \ MUST\n   deny service to any node that has not clearly established trust with\n\
    \   the U-LLN.\n   Consideration SHOULD be given to cases where the U-LLN may\
    \ interface\n   with other networks such as a home network.  The U-LLN SHOULD\
    \ NOT\n   interface with any external network that has not established trust.\n\
    \   The U-LLN SHOULD be capable of limiting the resources granted in\n   support\
    \ of an external network so as not to be vulnerable to DoS.\n   With low computation\
    \ power and scarce energy resources, U-LLNs' nodes\n   may not be able to resist\
    \ any attack from high-power malicious nodes\n   (e.g., laptops and strong radios).\
    \  However, the amount of damage\n   generated to the whole network SHOULD be\
    \ commensurate with the number\n   of nodes physically compromised.  For example,\
    \ an intruder taking\n   control over a single node SHOULD NOT be able to completely\
    \ deny\n   service to the whole network.\n   In general, the routing protocol(s)\
    \ SHOULD support the implementation\n   of routing security best practices across\
    \ the U-LLN.  Such an\n   implementation ought to include defense against, for\
    \ example,\n   eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, modification, and man-in-\n\
    \   the-middle attacks.\n   The choice of the routing security solutions will\
    \ have an impact on\n   the routing protocol(s).  To this end, routing protocol(s)\
    \ proposed\n   in the context of U-LLNs MUST support authentication and integrity\n\
    \   measures and SHOULD support confidentiality (routing security)\n   measures.\n"
