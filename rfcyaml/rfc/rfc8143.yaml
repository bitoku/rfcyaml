  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) [RFC3977] has
    been using\n   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] along with its precursor,\n
    \  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), since at least the year 2000.  The use of\n   TLS
    in NNTP was formalized in [RFC4642], providing implementation\n   recommendations
    at the same time.  In order to address the evolving\n   threat model on the Internet
    today, this document provides stronger\n   recommendations regarding that use.\n
    \  In particular, this document updates [RFC4642] by specifying that\n   NNTP
    implementations and deployments MUST follow the best current\n   practices documented
    in [BCP195], which currently consists of RFC\n   7525 (\"Recommendations for Secure
    Use of Transport Layer Security\n   (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS)\").  This includes\n   stronger recommendations regarding SSL/TLS protocol
    versions,\n   fallback to lower versions, TLS negotiation, TLS-level compression,\n
    \  TLS session resumption, cipher suites, public key lengths, forward\n   secrecy,
    hostname validation, certificate verification, and other\n   aspects of using
    TLS with NNTP.\n"

      has the same meaning as it does\n   in [RFC4642] or the NNTP core specification

      to TLS\n   negotiation immediately upon connection on a separate port.\n   The
      key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n

    title: 1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Updates/Changes to RFC 4642\n   This document updates [RFC4642] in the following
    aspects:\n   o  NNTP implementations and deployments SHOULD disable TLS-level\n
    \     compression (Section 3.3 of RFC 7525 [BCP195]), thus no longer\n      using
    TLS as a means to provide data compression (contrary to the\n      Abstract and
    Section 2.2.2 of [RFC4642]).\n   o  NNTP implementations and deployments SHOULD
    prefer implicit TLS,\n      and therefore use strict TLS configuration (Section
    3.2 of RFC\n      7525 [BCP195]).  That is to say, they SHOULD use a port dedicated\n
    \     to NNTP over TLS and begin the TLS negotiation immediately upon\n      connection
    (contrary to a dynamic upgrade from unencrypted to TLS-\n      protected traffic
    via the use of the STARTTLS command, as\n      Section 1 of [RFC4642] was encouraging).
    \ Implicit TLS is the\n      preferred way of using TLS with NNTP for the same
    reasons,\n      transposed to NNTP, as those given in Appendix A of [MUA-STS].\n
    \     (Note that [MUA-STS] and [RFC4642] have one author in common.)\n   o  NNTP
    implementations and deployments MUST NOT negotiate RC4 cipher\n      suites ([RFC7465]);
    this is contrary to Section 5 of [RFC4642],\n      which required them to implement
    the TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5\n      cipher suite so as to ensure that any two
    NNTP-compliant\n      implementations can be configured to interoperate.  This
    document\n      removes that requirement, so that NNTP client and server\n      implementations
    follow the recommendations given in Sections 4.2\n      and 4.2.1 of RFC 7525
    [BCP195] instead.  The mandatory-to-\n      implement cipher suite or cipher suites
    depend on the TLS protocol\n      version.  For instance, when TLS 1.2 is used,
    the\n      TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite MUST be implemented\n      (Section
    9 of [RFC5246]).\n   o  All NNTP clients and any NNTP server that is known by
    multiple\n      names MUST support the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension\n
    \     defined in Section 3 of [RFC6066], in conformance with Section 3.6\n      of
    RFC 7525 [BCP195].  It was only a \"SHOULD\" in Section 2.2.2 of\n      [RFC4642].\n
    \  o  NNTP implementations and deployments MUST follow the rules and\n      guidelines
    defined in [RFC6125] and [RFC5280] for hostname\n      validation and certificate
    verification.  Part of Section 5 of\n      [RFC4642] is, therefore, rationalized
    in favor of following those\n      two documents.\n   Appendix A of this document
    gives detailed changes with regard to the\n   wording of [RFC4642].\n"

- contents:
  - "3.  Recommendations\n   The best current practices documented in [BCP195] apply
    here.\n   Therefore, NNTP implementations and deployments compliant with this\n
    \  document are REQUIRED to comply with [BCP195] as well.\n   Instead of repeating
    those recommendations here, this document mostly\n   provides supplementary information
    regarding secure implementation\n   and deployment of NNTP technologies.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Compression\n   NNTP supports the use of the COMPRESS command, defined
      in Section 2.2\n   of [RFC8054], to compress data between an NNTP client and
      server.\n   Although this NNTP extension might have slightly stronger security\n
      \  properties than TLS-level compression [RFC3749] (since NNTP\n   compression
      can be activated after authentication has completed, thus\n   reducing the chances
      that authentication credentials can be leaked\n   via, for instance, a Compression
      Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME)\n   attack, as described in Section 2.6 of
      [CRIME]), this document\n   neither encourages nor discourages the use of the
      NNTP COMPRESS\n   extension.\n"
    title: 3.1.  Compression
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Protocol Versions and Security Preferences\n   NNTP implementations of
      news servers are encouraged to support\n   options to configure 1) the minimal
      TLS protocol version to accept\n   and 2) which cipher suites, signature algorithms,
      or groups (like\n   elliptic curves) to use for incoming connections.  Additional
      options\n   can naturally also be supported.  The goal is to enable\n   administrators
      of news servers to easily and quickly strengthen\n   security, if needed (for
      instance, by rejecting cipher suites\n   considered unsafe with regard to local
      policy).\n   News clients may also support similar options, either configurable
      by\n   the user or enforced by the news reader.\n"

    - "3.3.  Server Name Indication\n   The TLS extension for Server Name Indication
      (SNI) defined in\n   Section 3 of [RFC6066] MUST be implemented by all news
      clients.  It\n   also MUST be implemented by any news server that is known by
      multiple\n   names.  (Otherwise, it is not possible for a server with several\n
      \  hostnames to present the correct certificate to the client.)\n"

    - "3.4.  Prevention of SSL Stripping\n   In order to help prevent SSL Stripping
      attacks (Section 2.1 of\n   [RFC7457]), NNTP implementations and deployments
      MUST follow the\n   recommendations provided in Section 3.2 of RFC 7525 [BCP195].\n
      \  Notably, in case implicit TLS is not used, news clients SHOULD\n   attempt
      to negotiate TLS even if the server does not advertise the\n   STARTTLS capability
      label in response to the CAPABILITIES command\n   (Section 2.1 of [RFC4642]).\n"
    title: 3.4.  Prevention of SSL Stripping
  - contents:
    - "3.5.  Authenticated Connections\n   [RFC4642] already provides recommendations
      and requirements for\n   certificate validation in the context of checking the
      client or the\n   server's identity.  Those requirements are strengthened by\n
      \  Appendix A.5 of this document.\n   Wherever possible, it is best to prefer
      certificate-based\n   authentication (along with Simple Authentication and Security
      Layer\n   (SASL) [RFC4422]), and ensure that:\n   o  Clients authenticate servers.\n
      \  o  Servers authenticate clients.\n   o  Servers authenticate other peer servers.\n
      \  This document does not mandate certificate-based authentication,\n   although
      such authentication is strongly preferred.  As mentioned in\n   Section 2.2.2
      of [RFC4642], the AUTHINFO SASL command (Section 2.4 of\n   [RFC4643]) with
      the EXTERNAL mechanism (Appendix A of [RFC4422]) MAY\n   be used to authenticate
      a client once its TLS credentials have been\n   successfully exchanged.\n   Given
      the pervasiveness of eavesdropping [RFC7258], even an encrypted\n   but unauthenticated
      connection might be better than an unencrypted\n   connection (this is similar
      to the \"better-than-nothing security\"\n   approach for IPsec [RFC5386], and
      in accordance with opportunistic\n   security principles [RFC7435]).  Encrypted
      but unauthenticated\n   connections include connections negotiated using anonymous
      Diffie-\n   Hellman mechanisms or using self-signed certificates, among others.\n
      \  Note: when an NNTP server receives a Netnews article, it MAY add a\n   <diag-match>
      (Section 3.1.5 of [RFC5536]), which appears as \"!!\" in\n   the Path header
      field of that article, to indicate that it verified\n   the identity of the
      client or peer server.  This document encourages\n   the construction of such
      Path header fields, as described in\n   Section 3.2.1 of [RFC5537].\n"

    - "3.6.  Human Factors\n   NNTP clients SHOULD provide ways for end users (and
      NNTP servers\n   SHOULD provide ways for administrators) to complete at least
      the\n   following tasks:\n   o  Determine if a given incoming or outgoing connection
      is encrypted\n      using a security layer (either using TLS or an SASL mechanism
      that\n      negotiates a security layer).\n   o  Be warned if the version of
      TLS used for encryption of a given\n      stream is not secure enough.\n   o
      \ If authenticated encryption is used, determine how the connection\n      was
      authenticated or verified.\n   o  Be warned if the certificate offered by an
      NNTP server cannot be\n      verified.\n   o  Be warned if the cipher suite
      used to encrypt a connection is not\n      secure enough.\n   o  Be warned if
      the certificate changes for a given server.\n   o  When a security layer is
      not already in place, be warned if a\n      given server stops advertising the
      STARTTLS capability label in\n      response to the CAPABILITIES command (Section
      2.1 of [RFC4642]),\n      whereas it advertised the STARTTLS capability label
      during any\n      previous connection within a (possibly configurable) time
      frame.\n      (Otherwise, a human might not see the warning the first time,
      and\n      the warning would disappear immediately after that.)\n   o  Be warned
      if a failure response to the STARTTLS command is\n      received from the server,
      whereas the STARTTLS capability label\n      was advertised.\n   Note that the
      last two tasks cannot occur when implicit TLS is used,\n   and that the penultimate
      task helps prevent an attack known as \"SSL\n   Stripping\" (Section 2.1 of
      [RFC7457]).\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Beyond the security considerations already described
    in [RFC4642],\n   [RFC6125], and [BCP195], the following caveat is worth mentioning\n
    \  when not using implicit TLS: NNTP servers need to ensure that they\n   are
    not vulnerable to the STARTTLS command injection vulnerability\n   (Section 2.2
    of [RFC7457]).  Though this command MUST NOT be\n   pipelined, an attacker could
    pipeline it.  Therefore, NNTP servers\n   MUST discard any NNTP command received
    between the use of STARTTLS\n   and the end of TLS negotiation.\n"

    changes that this document applies to\n   [RFC4642].\n"
  - contents:
    - "A.1.  Related to TLS-Level Compression\n   The second sentence in the Abstract
      in [RFC4642] is replaced with the\n   following text:\n      The primary goal
      is to provide encryption for single-link\n      confidentiality purposes, but
      data integrity, and (optional)\n      certificate-based peer entity authentication
      are also possible.\n   The second sentence of the first paragraph in Section
      2.2.2 of\n   [RFC4642] is replaced with the following text:\n      The STARTTLS
      command is usually used to initiate session security,\n      although it can
      also be used for client and/or server certificate\n      authentication.\n"
    title: A.1.  Related to TLS-Level Compression
  - contents:
    - "A.2.  Related to Implicit TLS\n   The third and fourth paragraphs in Section
      1 of [RFC4642] are\n   replaced with the following text:\n      TCP port 563
      is dedicated to NNTP over TLS, and registered in the\n      IANA Service Name
      and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry for\n      that usage.  NNTP implementations
      using TCP port 563 begin the TLS\n      negotiation immediately upon connection
      and then continue with the\n      initial steps of an NNTP session.  This immediate
      TLS negotiation\n      on a separate port (referred to in this document as \"implicit\n
      \     TLS\") is the preferred way of using TLS with NNTP.\n      If a host wishes
      to offer separate servers for transit and reading\n      clients (Section 3.4.1
      of [NNTP]), TCP port 563 SHOULD be used for\n      implicit TLS with the reading
      server, and an unused port of its\n      choice different than TCP port 433
      SHOULD be used for implicit TLS\n      with the transit server.  The ports used
      for implicit TLS should\n      be clearly communicated to the clients, and specifically
      that no\n      plaintext communication occurs before the TLS session is\n      negotiated.\n
      \     As some existing implementations negotiate TLS via a dynamic\n      upgrade
      from unencrypted to TLS-protected traffic during an NNTP\n      session on well-known
      TCP ports 119 or 433, this specification\n      formalizes the STARTTLS command
      in use for that purpose.  However,\n      as already mentioned above, implementations
      SHOULD use implicit\n      TLS on a separate port.\n      Note: a common alternative
      to protect NNTP exchanges with transit\n      servers that do not implement
      TLS is the use of IPsec with\n      encryption [RFC4301].\n   An additional
      informative reference to [RFC4301] is, therefore, added\n   to Section 7.2 of
      [RFC4642].\n"

  - contents:
    - "A.3.  Related to RC4 Cipher Suites\n   The third paragraph in Section 5 of
      [RFC4642] is removed.\n   Consequently, NNTP no longer requires the implementation
      of any\n   cipher suites, other than those prescribed by TLS (Section 9 of\n
      \  [RFC5246]), and Sections 4.2 and 4.2.1 of RFC 7525 [BCP195].\n"

      7525 [BCP195] applies.\n"

    - "A.5.  Related to Certificate Verification\n   The text between \"During the
      TLS negotiation\" and \"identity\n   bindings).\" in Section 5 of [RFC4642]
      is replaced with the following\n   text:\n      During TLS negotiation, the
      client MUST verify the server's\n      identity in order to prevent man-in-the-middle
      attacks.  The\n      client MUST follow the rules and guidelines defined in
      [RFC6125],\n      where the reference identifier MUST be the server hostname
      that\n      the client used to open the connection, and that is also specified\n
      \     in the TLS \"server_name\" extension [RFC6066].  The following NNTP-\n
      \     specific consideration applies: DNS domain names in server\n      certificates
      MAY contain the wildcard character \"*\" as the\n      complete leftmost label
      within the identifier.\n      If the match fails, the client MUST follow the
      recommendations in\n      Section 6.6 of [RFC6125] regarding certificate pinning
      and\n      fallback.\n      Beyond server identity checking, clients also MUST
      apply the\n      procedures specified in [RFC5280] for general certificate\n
      \     validation (e.g., certificate integrity, signing, and path\n      validation).\n
      \  Additional normative references to [RFC5280] (replacing [PKI-CERT],\n   which
      it obsoletes), [RFC6066], and [RFC6125] are, therefore, added\n   to Section
      7.1 of [RFC4642].\n"

      special requirement for NNTP with\n   regard to TLS Client Hello messages.  Section
