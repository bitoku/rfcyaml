    - "3.1.  Test \"mailboxexists\"\n   Usage:  mailboxexists <mailbox-names: string-list>\n
      \  The \"mailboxexists\" test is true if all mailboxes listed in the\n   \"mailbox-names\"
      argument exist in the mailstore, and each allows the\n   user in whose context
      the Sieve script runs to \"deliver\" messages\n   into it.  When the mailstore
      is an IMAP server, \"delivery\" of\n   messages is possible if:\n   a.  the
      READ-WRITE response code is present for the mailbox (see\n       Section 7.1
      of [IMAP]), if IMAP Access Control List (ACL)\n       [IMAPACL] is not supported
      by the server, or\n   b.  the user has 'p' or 'i' rights for the mailbox (see
      Section 5.2\n       of [IMAPACL]).\n   Note that a successful \"mailboxexists\"
      test for a mailbox doesn't\n   necessarily mean that a \"fileinto\" action on
      this mailbox would\n   succeed.  For example, the \"fileinto\" action might
      put user over\n   quota.  The \"mailboxexists\" only verifies existence of the
      mailbox\n   and whether the user in whose context the Sieve script runs has\n
      \  permissions to execute \"fileinto\" on it.\n   The capability string for
      use with the require command is \"mailbox\".\n   Example: The following example
      assumes that the Sieve engine also\n   supports \"reject\" [REJECT] and \"fileinto\"
      [SIEVE].  However, these\n   extensions are not required in order to implement
      the \"mailbox\"\n   extension.\n        require [\"fileinto\", \"reject\", \"mailbox\"];\n
      \       if mailboxexists \"Partners\" {\n           fileinto \"Partners\";\n
      \       } else {\n           reject \"This message was not accepted by the Mailstore\";\n

      <mailbox: string>\n   If the optional \":create\" argument is specified with
      \"fileinto\", it\n   instructs the Sieve interpreter to create the specified
      mailbox, if\n   needed, before attempting to deliver the message into the specified\n
      \  mailbox.  If the mailbox already exists, this argument is ignored.\n   Failure
      to create the specified mailbox is considered to be an error.\n   The capability
      string for use with the \":create\" parameter is\n   \"mailbox\".\n"

      test retrieves the value of the mailbox annotation \"annotation-\n   name\"
      for the mailbox \"mailbox\" [METADATA].  The retrieved value is\n   compared
      to the \"key-list\".  The test returns true if the annotation\n   exists and
      its value matches any of the keys.\n   The default match type is \":is\" [SIEVE].
      \ The default comparator is\n   \"i;ascii-casemap\" [SIEVE].\n   The capability
      string for use with the require command is\n   \"mboxmetadata\".\n   Annotations
      MUST be accessed with the permissions of the user in\n   whose context the Sieve
      script runs, and annotations starting with\n   the \"/private\" prefix MUST
      be those of the user in whose context the\n   Sieve script runs.\n   Example:
      The following example assumes that the Sieve engine also\n   supports the \"vacation\"
      [VACATION] extension.  However, this\n   extension is not required in order

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Extensions defined in this document deliberately
    don't provide a way\n   to modify annotations.\n   A failure to retrieve data
    due to the server storing the annotations\n   being down or otherwise inaccessible
    may alter the result of Sieve\n   processing.  So implementations SHOULD treat
    a temporary failure to\n   retrieve annotations in the same manner as a temporary
    failure to\n   retrieve a Sieve script.  For example, if the Sieve script is stored\n
    \  in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and the script\n   can't
    be retrieved when a message is processed, then the agent\n   performing Sieve
    processing can, for example, assume that the script\n   doesn't exist or delay
    message delivery until the script can be\n   retrieved successfully.  Annotations
    should be treated as if they are\n   a part of the script itself, so a temporary
    failure to retrieve them\n   should be handled in the same way as a temporary
    failure to retrieve\n   the Sieve script itself.\n   Protocols/APIs used to retrieve
    annotations MUST provide at least the\n   same level of confidentiality as protocols/APIs
    used to retrieve\n   Sieve scripts.  For example, if Sieve scripts are retrieved
    using\n   LDAP secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, then the\n
    \  protocol used to retrieve annotations must use a comparable mechanism\n   for
    providing connection confidentiality.  In particular, the\n   protocol used to
    retrieve annotations must not be lacking encryption.\n"
