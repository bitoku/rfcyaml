Introduction [RFC7001] specifies the Authentication Results header field for conveying results of message authentication checks.
As S/MIME signature verification (and alteration) is sometimes implemented in border message transfer agents, guards, and gateways (for example, see [RFC3183]), there is a need to convey signature verification status to Mail User Agents (MUAs) and downstream filters.
This document defines a new authentication method to be used in the Authentication Results header field for S/MIME related signature checks.
Conventions Used in This Document
The formal syntax uses the Augmented Backus Naur Form (ABNF)
[RFC5234] notation, including the core rules defined in Appendix B of [RFC5234].
"smime" Authentication Method S/MIME signature and countersignature verification is represented by the "smime" method and is defined in [RFC5751].
The message was not signed.
A signature is "acceptable to the verifier" if it passes local policy checks (or there are no specific local policy checks).
For example, a verifier might require that the domain in the rfc822Name subjectAltName in the signing certificate matches the domain in the address of the sender of the message (value of the Sender header field, if present; value of the From header field otherwise), thus making third party signatures unacceptable.
[RFC5751] advises that if a message fails verification, it should be treated as an unsigned message.
A report of "fail" here permits the receiver of the report to decide how to handle the failure.
A report of "neutral" or "none" preempts that choice, ensuring that the message will be treated as if it had not been signed.
Email Authentication Parameters for S/MIME
This document defines several new authentication parameters for conveying S/MIME related information, such as the location of an S/MIME signature and the identity associated with the entity that signed the message or one of its body parts.
body.smime part body.smime part contains the MIME body part reference that contains the S/MIME signature.
The syntax of this property is described by the smime part ABNF production below.
pkcs7 mime (containing SignedData) media type body parts are referenced using the <section> syntax (see Section 6.4.5 of [RFC3501]).
<Defined in Section 6.4.5 of [RFC3501]
body.smime identifier body.smime identifier contains the email address [RFC5322] associated with the S/MIME signature referenced in the corresponding body.smime part.
The email address can be specified explicitly in the signer's X.509 certificate or derived from the identity of the signer.
Note that this email address can correspond to a countersignature.
body.smime serial and body.smime issuer
body.smime serial contains the serialNumber of the X.509 certificate associated with the S/MIME signature (see Section 4.1.2.2 of [RFC5280])
referenced in the corresponding body.smime part.
body.smime issuer contains the issuer name DN (distinguished name) (e.g., "CN CA1,ST BC,c CA") of the X.509 certificate associated with the S/MIME signature (see Section 4.1.2.4 of [RFC5280])
referenced in the corresponding body.smime part.
Either both or neither of body.smime serial and body.smime issuer should be present in an Authentication Results header field.
body.smime serial and body.smime issuer are used for cases when body.smime identifier (email address) can't be derived by the entity adding the corresponding Authentication Results header field.
For example, this can be used when gatewaying from X.400.

IANA has added the following entries to the "Email Authentication Result Names" sub registry of the "Email Authentication Parameters" registry:
This document doesn't add new security considerations not already covered by [RFC7001] and [RFC5751].
In particular, security considerations related to the use of weak cryptography over plaintext, weakening and breaking of cryptographic algorithms over time, and changing the behavior of message processing based on presence of a signature specified in [RFC5751] are relevant to this document.
Similarly, the following security considerations specified in [RFC7001] are particularly relevant to this document: Forged Header Fields, Misleading Results, Internal Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) Lists, and Compromised Internal Hosts.
To repeat something already mentioned in RFC 7001, Section 7.1: An MUA or filter that accesses a mailbox whose messages are handled by a non conformant MTA, and understands Authentication Results header fields, could potentially make false conclusions based on forged header fields.
A malicious user or agent could forge a header field using the DNS domain of a receiving ADMD as the authserv id token in the value of the header field and, with the rest of the value, claim that the message was properly authenticated.
The non conformant MTA would fail to strip the forged header field, and the MUA could inappropriately trust it.
For this reason, it is best not to have processing of the Authentication Results header field enabled by default; instead, it should be ignored, at least for the purposes of enacting filtering decisions, unless specifically enabled by the user or administrator after verifying that the border MTA is compliant.
It is acceptable to have an MUA aware of this specification but have an explicit list of hostnames whose Authentication Results header fields are trustworthy; however, this list should initially be empty.
So, to emphasize this point: whenever possible, MUAs should implement their own S/MIME signature verification instead of implementing this specification.
Note that agents adding Authentication Results header fields containing S/MIME authentication method might be unable to verify S/MIME signatures inside encrypted CMS content types such as EnvelopedData [RFC5652].
So, agents processing Authentication Results header fields can't treat the lack of an Authentication Results header field with S/MIME authentication method as an indication that the corresponding S/MIME signature is missing, invalid, or valid.
