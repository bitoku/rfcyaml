- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method\
    \ of\n   encapsulating Network Layer protocol information over point-to-point\n\
    \   links.  PPP also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol, and\n   proposes\
    \ a family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for\n   establishing and configuring\
    \ different network-layer protocols.\n   This document defines the NCP for establishing\
    \ and configuring\n   Digital's DNA Phase IV Routing protocol (DECnet Phase IV)\
    \ over PPP.\n   This document applies only to DNA Phase IV Routing messages (both\n\
    \   data and control), and not to other DNA Phase IV protocols (MOP, LAT,\n  \
    \ etc.).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are two basic approaches to running the DNA Phase\
    \ IV Routing\n   protocol over a serial line:\n   1. The approached that several\
    \ router vendors have taken which is to\n      treat the serial link as an Ethernet,\
    \ using the same data and\n      control messages an Ethernet would use.\n   2.\
    \ The approach defined by Digital, which uses DDCMP and slightly\n      different\
    \ control messages.\n   This document will define a method that uses the first\
    \ approach.\n"

    \ as data link clients are:\n      o  DNA Phase IV Routing\n         The Phase\
    \ IV Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Routing\n         protocol is a network\
    \ layer protocol providing services similar\n         to that of DoD IP.  It routes\

- title: 3.  A PPP Network Control Protocol for DNA Phase IV Routing
  contents:
  - "3.  A PPP Network Control Protocol for DNA Phase IV Routing\n   The DNA Phase\
    \ IV Routing Control Protocol (DNCP) is responsible for\n   configuring, enabling,\
    \ and disabling the DNA Phase IV Routing\n   protocol modules on both ends of\
    \ the point-to-point link.  DNCP uses\n   the same packet exchange mechanism as\
    \ the Link Control Protocol\n   (LCP).  DNCP packets may not be exchanged until\
    \ PPP has reached the\n   Network-Layer Protocol phase.  DNCP packets received\
    \ before this\n   phase is reached should be silently discarded.\n   The DNA Phase\
    \ IV Routing Control Protocol is exactly the same as the\n   Link Control Protocol\
    \ [1] with the following exceptions:\n   Frame Modifications\n      The packet\
    \ may utilize any modifications to the basic frame format\n      which have been\
    \ negotiated during the Link Establishment phase.\n   Data Link Layer Protocol\
    \ Field\n      Exactly one DNCP packet is encapsulated in the Information field\n\
    \      of a PPP Data Link Layer frame where the Protocol field indicates\n   \
    \   type hex 8027 (DNA Phase IV Control Protocol).\n   Code field\n      Only\
    \ Codes 1 through 7 (Configure-Request, Configure-Ack,\n      Configure-Nak, Configure-Reject,\
    \ Terminate-Request, Terminate-Ack\n      and Code-Reject) are used.  Other Codes\
    \ should be treated as\n      unrecognized and should result in Code-Rejects.\n\
    \   Timeouts\n      DNCP packets may not be exchanged until PPP has reached the\n\
    \      Network-Layer Protocol phase.  An implementation should be\n      prepared\
    \ to wait for Authentication and Link Quality Determination\n      to finish before\
    \ timing out waiting for a Configure-Ack or other\n      response.  It is suggested\
    \ that an implementation give up only\n      after user intervention or a configurable\
    \ amount of time.\n   Configuration Option Types\n      DNCP has no Configuration\
    \ Options.\n"

  - "4.  Sending DNA Phase IV Routing Packets\n   Before any DNA Phase IV Routing\
    \ packets may be communicated, PPP must\n   reach the Network-Layer Protocol phase,\
    \ and the DNA Phase IV Routing\n   Control Protocol must reach the Opened state.\n\
    \   Exactly one octet-count field and one DNA Phase IV Routing packet are\n  \
    \ encapsulated in the information field of a PPP Data Link Layer frame\n   where\
    \ the Protocol field indicates type hex 0027 (DNA Phase IV\n   Routing).  The\
    \ octet-count contains a count of the number of octets\n   in the DNA Phase IV\
    \ Routing packet.  It is two octets in length\n   itself, and is stored in VAX\
    \ byte ordering, to be more consistent\n   with DNA Phase IV Routing over Ethernet\
    \ (i.e. least significant byte\n   first).  It is needed to disambiguate optional\
    \ padding octets from\n   real information.\n   The maximum length of an DNA Phase\
    \ IV Routing packet transmitted over\n   a PPP link is the same as the maximum\
    \ length of the Information field\n   of a PPP data link layer frame minus 2 octets\
    \ (for the Length field).\n   The format of the packets themselves is the same\
    \ as the format used\n   over Ethernet, without the Ethernet header, Pad, and\

  - "5.  General Considerations\n   When a topology change in the network occurs,\
    \ DNA Phase IV Routing\n   nodes immediately propagate changes via Level 1 and\
    \ Level 2 Routing\n   messages, with a 1 second minimum delay between updates.\
    \  DNA Phase\n   IV Routing nodes also periodically retransmit the complete Level\
    \ 1\n   and Level 2 distance vectors to guard against data corruption in host\n\
    \   memory, and (in the case of Ethernet) loss of packets due to media\n   errors.\
    \  Because Digital's serial links run a protocol that\n   guarantees delivery\
    \ of packets (DDCMP), the recommended default\n   retransmit time is long (600\
    \ seconds), whereas for Ethernet, where\n   packet delivery is not guaranteed,\
    \ the recommended default is short\n   (10 seconds), as documented in [2].  To\
    \ achieve convergence of routes\n   within a satisfactory time, the interval between\
    \ updates should be\n   based upon the error rate of underlying data link.  As\
    \ such, it is\n   recommended that the time between routing updates be user\n\
    \   configurable per PPP interface.\n   The Hello timer and Listen timer should\
    \ be set according to the\n   recommendations for broadcast links (15 and 45 seconds,\n\
    \   respectively).\n   Routers are not required to send routing updates if the\
    \ remote node\n   connected via the PPP link is an endnode.  Endnodes are required\
    \ to\n   discard all routing updates received over a PPP link.  The type of a\n\
    \   node (endnode versus routing) can be determined from the hello\n   messages\
    \ received from it.\n"
