  - "Abstract\n   This document describes plans for support of route aggregation,\
    \ as\n   specified in the descriptions of Classless Inter-Domain Routing\n   (CIDR)\
    \ [1] and the BGP-4 protocol [2], by the NSFNET Backbone Network\n   Service.\
    \  Mechanisms for exchange of route aggregates between the\n   backbone service\
    \ and regional/midlevel networks are specified.\n   Additionally, the memo proposes\
    \ the implementation of an Aggregate\n   Registry which can be used by network\
    \ service providers to share\n   information about the use of aggregation.  Finally,\
    \ the operational\n   impact of incorporating CIDR and aggregation is considered,\
    \ including\n   an analysis of how routing table size will be affected.  This\
    \ impact\n   analysis will be used to modify the deployment plan, if necessary,\
    \ to\n   maximize operational stability.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   The Internet network service provider community and router\
    \ vendors\n   (as well as the IESG and various IETF working groups) have agreed\n\
    \   that the time for deployment of route aggregation is upon us. This\n   topic\
    \ has been discussed in the BGP-D, NJM and ORAD working groups at\n   several\
    \ IETF meetings; it was a discussion topic of the NSFNET\n   Regional Techs' Meetings\
    \ in January and June, 1993; and it was also a\n   topic of several meetings of\
    \ the Federal Engineering Planning Group\n   and Engineering and Operations Working\
    \ Group of the Federal Network\n   Council.\n   All have generally agreed that\
    \ Summer, 1993 is the time to enable\n   BGP-4 and CIDR aggregation.  Each of\
    \ the parties is responsible for\n   its own aspect of CIDR implementation and\
    \ practice. This memo\n   describes Merit's plans for support of route aggregation\
    \ on the\n   NSFNET, and a proposal for implementing a database of aggregation\n\
    \   information for use by network providers.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.1 Inbound Announcements\n   An example of the way a network number is currently\
    \ configured is as\n   follows:\n         35      1:237   2:233   3:183   4:266\
    \   5:267  6:1225\n   This shows that network number 35 (ie. 35.0.0.0, a class\
    \ A net\n   number) is configured on the T3 backbone such that routing\n   announcements\
    \ are expected from up to 6 autonomous systems. The\n   primary path is via AS\
    \ 237, secondary is via AS 233, etc.\n"
- title: 2.1.2 Outbound Announcements
  contents:
  - "2.1.2 Outbound Announcements\n   Currently the NSFNET database has a list of\
    \ AS's or network numbers\n   for each neighbor AS that are announced by the backbone\
    \ to that AS.\n   These announcements are specified currently by \"announcetoAS\"\
    \n   statements--which implement policies submitted by midlevels to\n   Merit--and\
    \ then included in the ANSnet router configuration files.\n   There are two forms\
    \ of these statements.  The first form uses the\n   \"norestrict\" clause and\
    \ indicates that all of the network numbers\n   within each AS in the list should\
    \ be announced to the neighbor\n   midlevel AS. For example:\n         announcetoAS\
    \ 42 norestrict ASlist 22 26 38 60 68\n   In this example, the NSFNET is configured\
    \ to announce to neighboring\n   midlevel AS 42, all networks in the routing table\
    \ that were announced\n   from AS's 22, 26, 38, 60 and 68.\n   If the \"norestrict\"\
    \ keyword is changed to \"restrict\", this indicates\n   that an explicit announce\
    \ list of network numbers for the AS is\n   specified in the configuration file.\
    \ The NSFNET will only announce\n   network numbers that were announced by the\
    \ AS's in the list, *AND*\n   which appear in the \"restrict list\" of network\
    \ numbers submitted\n   separately by the midlevel.\n      For example,\n    \
    \     announcetoAS 42 restrict ASlist 22\n         announce 192.135.237 <other\
    \ info>\n   These statements mean that AS 42 only wishes to hear announcements\n\
    \   from the backbone about the nets in AS 22 which are explicitly listed\n  \
    \ here (i.e., net 192.135.237).\n   It is also possible, when using the \"restrict\"\
    \ keyword, to list\n   specific \"noannounce\" lines. Those indicate that all\
    \ of the networks\n   listed in the routing table for the AS should be announced\
    \ except\n   those listed on the noannounce clauses.  (There is also a\n   \"\
    noannouncetoAS\" statement[4].)\n"
- title: 2.2 New Configuration Features for Aggregation
  contents:
  - "2.2 New Configuration Features for Aggregation\n   There will be three new capabilities\
    \ for which the backbone service\n   can be configured to support aggregation.\
    \ The first two allow\n   aggregates to be accepted and stored in the backbone\
    \ routing tables\n   based on announcements by the regional network (autonomous\
    \ system or\n   AS) peers.  The third allows the announcement of aggregates to\
    \ the AS\n   neighbor peers. The following sections give examples of the three\n\
    \   features.\n   We use the notation <net-IP prefix-length> to describe an aggregate.\n\
    \   This refers to the IP prefix \"net-IP\", with a mask which has\n   \"prefix-length\"\
    \ 1's as counted from the high-order end. For example,\n   <192.64.128 17> is\
    \ equivalent to <192.64.128, 255.255.128.0> [5].\n   (The form using prefix-length\
    \ rather than the mask is more compact.)\n"
- title: 2.2.1 NSFNET accepts aggregates
  contents:
  - "2.2.1 NSFNET accepts aggregates\n   In this case the regional peer router is\
    \ CIDR-capable (i.e., runs\n   BGP-4) and the announcement comes into the backbone\
    \ as an IP address\n   prefix.\n   To illustrate this in the spirit of sec. 2.1.1:\n\
    \         <192.64.128 17>         1:189 2:24 3:267\n   In this example, independent\
    \ of the \"class\" of IP network number, an\n   aggregate containing network addresses\
    \ matching a pattern in which\n   the first 17 bits match the prefix 192.64.128\
    \ will be accepted in\n   announcements to the NSFNET service.  The primary path\
    \ to\n   destinations covered by the prefix is expected via AS 189, the\n   secondary,\
    \ via AS 24, etc.\n"
- title: 2.2.2 NSFNET aggregates by proxy
  contents:
  - "2.2.2 NSFNET aggregates by proxy\n   The other method of incorporating CIDR aggregate\
    \ announcements into\n   the backbone routing tables is that of aggregation by\
    \ proxy.  In this\n   case, the backbone is configured to perform aggregation\
    \ on behalf of\n   a peer AS which is not configured to announce the aggregate\
    \ to the\n   backbone (i.e., an AS which does not connect to the backbone via\
    \ a\n   CIDR-capable peer).\n   An example of this aggregation technique is:\n\
    \         proxy <192.64.128 17>     1:189  2:24  3:267\n                 if  <192.64.192\
    \ 24>\n                 or  <192.64.129 24>\n                 or  <192.64.167\
    \ 24>\n   (Note: the syntax used in this document is arbitrary and is only used\n\
    \   to illustrate the method. The syntax to be used in actual routing\n   requests\
    \ is to be determined.)\n   In this example, the aggregate <192.64.128 17> will\
    \ be stored and\n   propagated within the backbone as an aggregate under a set\
    \ of\n   conditions.  Initially, the GateD support will allow an \"OR\" list of\n\
    \   conditions such that if one of the aggregates in the list matches the\n  \
    \ proxy aggregate will be stored[6].  For the case above, this means\n   that,\
    \ if any of the CIDR aggregates:\n         <192.64.192 24>\n         <192.64.129\
    \ 24>\n         <192.64.167 24>\n   (which--under the current, class-based IP\
    \ address system--are\n   equivalent to the class C net numbers 192.64.192, 192.64.129,\
    \ or\n   192.64.167, respectively) is heard, the backbone router will act as\n\
    \   though it heard the announcement of the single CIDR aggregate\n   <192.64.128\
    \ 17>.\n"
- title: 2.2.3 NSFNET announces aggregates
  contents:
  - "2.2.3 NSFNET announces aggregates\n   The functionality of the current system,\
    \ as outlined in sec. 2.1.2,\n   above, will continue to exist once CIDR is implemented.\
    \ The\n   \"norestrict\" function (or its equivalent in the new software) will\n\
    \   specify that all network reachability information received from a set\n  \
    \ of Autonomous Systems, including any aggregates, will be announced.\n   It should\
    \ also be possible to use to the equivalents of the\n   \"restrict\" keyword and\
    \ the \"announce\" (or \"noannounce\") statement in\n   order to limit the announcements\
    \ of the aggregations within an AS to\n   any desired subset.\n"
- title: 2.3 Specifically Unsupported Capabilities, Limits of Initial Deployment
  contents:
  - "2.3 Specifically Unsupported Capabilities, Limits of Initial Deployment\n   There\
    \ are some aspects of aggregation which will specifically not be\n   supported\
    \ in the initial deployment of CIDR capabilities on the\n   NSFNET backbone. \
    \ In particular, when the NSFNET service announces\n   routes to midlevel peers,\
    \ de-aggregation will not be performed [3].\n   Therefore, a peer which needs\
    \ to receive full routing information\n   should run a protocol which supports\
    \ CIDR (initially, BGP-4; later,\n   IDRP). Peer networks using default routing\
    \ will be able to reach\n   networks that are part of aggregated routing information\
    \ across the\n   backbone (as in section 6.4 of [3]).\n"
- title: 3.  CIDR Aggregate Registry
  contents:
  - "3.  CIDR Aggregate Registry\n   In discussions with network service providers,\
    \ it has become apparent\n   that there is a great need for sharing of aggregate\
    \ information; this\n   is necessary to fulfill the coordination referred to in\
    \ sec. 2.3.\n   Beyond the need to implement CIDR aggregation facilities in the\n\
    \   NSFNET Policy-Based Routing Database (as described in section 2),\n   there\
    \ is a clear need to have a separate database which will allow\n   aggregate information\
    \ from any Autonomous System to be stored and\n   made available for easy electronic\
    \ retrieval. This information can be\n   used for routing coordination and policy\
    \ configuration in the larger,\n   non-NSFNET-centric, inter-domain context.\n\
    \   One of the expected uses of such a database is to help determine, as\n   CIDR\
    \ matures, the granularity of aggregation of network reachability\n   information\
    \ with respect to policy.  The useful scope of aggregation\n   is the subject\
    \ of much discussion[5][7], and will be influenced by\n   such considerations\
    \ as how network number allocation has been\n   handled, and whether the network\
    \ provider has renumbered its client\n   networks to conform to CIDR aggregation\
    \ boundaries. Rules and issues\n   regarding network number allocation with CIDR\
    \ are discussed in [8]\n   and [7].\n   In order further these goals, Merit proposes\
    \ to implement a \"CIDR\n   Aggregate Registry\" to provide sharing of aggregate\
    \ information for\n   the Internet inter-domain routing community. Initially,\
    \ this will be\n   a simple database without much structure. It is not intended\
    \ to hold\n   only aggregates which are announced or accepted by the NSFNET\n\
    \   service; rather, it should be a community registry that all will be\n   invited\
    \ to use and make use of.\n   The Aggregate Registry will consist of a list of\
    \ aggregate\n   announcement statements. Each statement consists of four types\
    \ of\n   information, along with contact information:\n      1) CIDR Aggregate:\
    \ The aggregate identifier, consisting of a\n      network number prefix and the\
    \ prefix length. For example,\n      <192.29.128 16>.\n      2) Home AS: The source\
    \ AS number for the aggregate. That is, the\n      AS number of the network service\
    \ provider that initially\n      aggregates the network reachability information\
    \ into the aggregate\n      for announcement to its neighbors.\n      3a) Announcing\
    \ AS: An AS number that announces this aggregate to\n      its neighbor AS's.\n\
    \      3b) Neighbor AS list: A list of neighbor AS's to whom the\n      aggregate\
    \ will be announced by the AS named in 3a.\n      4) Contact information: eg.\
    \ e-mail address and name or NIC handle\n      of the administrative and technical\
    \ contacts for the source AS.\n   Thus, a given aggregate is listed once as announced\
    \ by its source AS.\n   It may then be listed once again per transit AS which\
    \ announces the\n   aggregate downstream to its neighbors.  For example, the CIDR\n\
    \   aggregate <199.29.128 16> could be listed as:\n          CIDR aggregate  home\
    \ ann  neighbor\n          (prefix-length) AS   AS   AS list         contacts\n\

    \ syntax used for objects\n         in the RIPE-81 paper[9].\n   Here, AS 100\
    \ (the source AS) performs any aggregation and announces\n   the CIDR aggregate\
    \ <199.29.128 16> to neighbor ASs 200, 201, and 690.\n   In turn, AS 200 announces\
    \ this same aggregate to its neighbor ASs 297\n   and 372; further lines show\
    \ announcements of the given aggregate by\n   AS 690 and AS 201.\n   Note that\
    \ this registry reflects both the simple list of aggregates\n   that are supported\
    \ by the union of network providers, as well as\n   information on inter-domain\
    \ topology for the Internet.  Merit will\n   implement procedures for registering\
    \ any network provider's\n   aggregates in the Registry; for those CIDR aggregates\
    \ carried over\n   the NSFNET backbone, Merit will implement procedures for integrating\n\
    \   this Registry with the process of updating the aggregate routing\n   announcements.\
    \  Requests to update the information will be handled\n   via e-mail or on-line\
    \ registration tools.\n"

    \ other routing tables [1] [5].  The\n   burning question is: What is the magnitude\
    \ of this effect?  In view\n   of the various issues to be dealt with, this is\
    \ an important\n   consideration.\n   In terms of the immediate savings in reduction\
    \ of the NSFNET backbone\n   routing tables, if a set of aggregates were done\
    \ all at once, a\n   recent calculation--which might be characterized as an optimistic\n\
    \   estimate using a pessimistic algorithm (it looks for the longest\n   continuous\
    \ block of addresses announced to the NSFNET backbone)--\n   yields [12]:\n  \
    \      861 size  2 saving  861 announcements\n        286 size  4 saving  858\
    \ announcements\n        117 size  8 saving  819 announcements\n         67 size\

    \ announcements of 12348 (33%).\n   Here, the first column represents the number\
    \ of CIDR aggregates of\n   the given \"size,\" and shows the corresponding reduction\
    \ in net\n   announcements due to the adoption of this aggregate.  (A CIDR\n \
    \  aggregate of \"size <n>\" is one which encompasses <n> class A, B, or C\n \
    \  networks; the 67 \"size 16\" CIDR aggregates actually combine\n   announcements\
    \ for 16 separate networks into a single net aggregate.)\n   It is unclear, at\
    \ this time, whether or not the true savings would be\n   of this magnitude, but\
    \ the extended report provides a basis for\n   discussion [12].\n   The other\
    \ aspect of impact upon the routing tables, the reduction in\n   the rate of growth\
    \ (and the concomitant slowing of the rate of\n   exhaustion of IP address space),\
    \ is an entirely different matter.\n   Simple calculations related to the rate\
    \ of class B address space\n   exhaustion indicate that CIDR-conformant policies\

    \ An AS\n   topology database would be most useful in routing policy\n   determination\
    \ and coordination as well.\n   In addition to these areas, many other issues\
    \ require further work in\n   order to develop the operational framework necessary\
    \ for the\n   successful use of CIDR on the Internet. It is critical that the\n\
    \   deployment of CIDR and related tools to preserve address and routing\n   table\
    \ space must not compromise the operational stability of the\n   NSFNET and the\
    \ wider Internet.\n"
