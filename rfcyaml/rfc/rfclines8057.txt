Abstract This document describes the Namespace Identifiers (NIDs) "bbf", "broadband forum org", and "dslforum org" for Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by Broadband Forum (BBF).
BBF specifies and manages resources that utilize these three URN identification models.
Management activities for these and other resource types are handled by BBF.
Introduction Broadband Forum (BBF) is a non profit industry alliance driving broadband wireline solutions and empowering converged packet networks worldwide to better meet the needs of vendors, service providers, and their customers.
BBF develops multi service broadband packet networking specifications that address interoperability, architecture, and management.
Its work enables home, business, and converged broadband services, encompassing customer, access, and backbone networks.
Occasionally, BBF specification efforts require identifiers in a managed namespace so that they are unique and persistent.
To ensure that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of three specific Uniform Resource Name (URN)
Namespace Identifiers (NIDs) for use by BBF are being specified in this document, in full conformance with the NID registration process specified in [RFC3406].
The "bbf" NID is for new work efforts related to data models for protocols other than the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)
The "broadband forum org" and "dslforum org" NIDs are used for all data models related to CWMP [TR 069].
BBF has used the latter two NIDs for many years without formally registering them and has published widely implemented specifications that use these NIDs.
Use of the "dslforum org" NID started prior the organization's 2008 name change from DSL Forum to Broadband Forum.

Declared registrant of the namespace:
Registering organization Name: Broadband Forum Address:
5177 Brandin Court, Fremont, CA 94538, USA Designated contact Role: Manager, Namespace Email: help@broadband forum.org Declaration of syntactic structure: The syntax of namespace specific strings for the "bbf" namespace is <NSS> in [RFC2141].
BBF publishes information regarding the registered resources on the BBF Assigned Resources web page [BBF RESOURCES].
Identifier uniqueness considerations: BBF will manage resource classes using the "bbf" NID and will be the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent strings.
BBF is expected to guarantee the uniqueness of the strings themselves, or it may permit secondary responsibility for certain defined resources.
BBF may, at the namespace resource manager's discretion, designate/allocate experimental type values for testing purposes only.
Note that using experimental types may create collisions, as multiple users may use the same values for resources and specific strings.
Identifier persistence considerations: BBF will update the BBF Assigned Resources web page [BBF RESOURCES] to document the registered resources that use the "bbf" NID.
Process of identifier assignment: BBF procedures for URN assignment are provided at [BBF RESOURCES].
Process for identifier resolution: The namespace is not listed with a resolution discovery system; this is not applicable for this URN registration.
Rules for Lexical Equivalence: No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of [RFC2141] apply.
Conformance with URN Syntax: No special considerations.
URN assignment will be handled by procedures implemented in support of BBF activities.

The following examples represent hypothetical URNs that could be assigned by BBF.
broadband forum org:cwmp:datamodel 1 5 urn:
fast The first of these defines an URN to be used for CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP) data models conforming to rules for BBF's CWMP suite of specifications.
Namespace Considerations BBF develops various specifications that require the use of data models.
URN namespaces are key constructs to manage the definitions of those data models reliably with persistence and uniqueness.
The use of URNs should also help specification authors to maintain different versions of URNs and dependencies between URNs, across different versions of BBF specifications, if they so wish.
The "broadband forum org" and "dslforum org" NIDs have been used for many years by BBF without formal registration.
(Broadband Forum changed its name from DSL Forum in 2008.)
As they are referenced by multiple BBF specifications currently in common use, BBF is formalizing them.
The new "bbf" NID will be used for new work efforts that are not enhancements, updates, or extensions to work that currently makes use of the "broadband  forum org" and "dslforum org" NIDs.
Community Considerations Participants involved in the development and usage of Broadband Forum specifications will benefit from the publication of this namespace by providing consistent and reliable names for the XML namespaces, schema locations, and similar identifiers of physical data models published within BBF specifications.
The BBF specifications are publicly available and are licensed to manufacturers on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis.
BBF will maintain the allocation of resources for the "bbf", "broadband forum  org", and "dslforum org" NIDs at the following publicly viewable location: [BBF RESOURCES].
BBF will also maintain the corresponding specifications where the registered resources are referenced or used.
This document adds three new entries in the formal urn namespaces registry.
The namespaces are "bbf", "broadband forum org", and "dslforum org".
This is the defining document.
The entries can be found at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn namespaces> and any associated mirrors.
There are no additional security considerations other than those normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
