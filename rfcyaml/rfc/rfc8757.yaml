  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in
    [RFC8175].\n   It provides the exchange of link-related control information between\n
    \  DLEP peers.  DLEP peers are comprised of a modem and a router.  DLEP\n   defines
    a base set of mechanisms as well as support for possible\n   extensions.  This
    document defines one such extension.\n   The base DLEP specification includes
    the Latency Data Item, which\n   provides a single, implementation-dependent latency
    value on a link.\n   This document adds the ability to relay the minimum and maximum\n
    \  latency range seen on a link.  The extension defined in this document\n   is
    referred to as \"Latency Range\".\n   This document defines a new DLEP Extension
    Type Value that is used to\n   indicate the use of the extension; see Section
    2.  A new DLEP Data\n   Item is defined in Section 3.\n"

    - "1.1.  Key Words\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
      \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\",
      \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described
      in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n
      \  capitals, as shown here.\n"

- contents:
  - "2.  Extension Usage and Identification\n   The use of the Latency Range Extension
    SHOULD be configurable.  To\n   indicate that the Latency Range Extension is to
    be used, an\n   implementation MUST include the Latency Range Extension Type Value
    in\n   the Extensions Supported Data Item.  The Extensions Supported Data\n   Item
    is sent and processed according to [RFC8175].\n   Note: The usage of the extension
    defined in this document does not\n   impact processing associated with the Latency
    Data Item defined in\n   [RFC8175].\n   The Latency Range Extension Type Value
    is 4; see Section 5.\n"

  - "3.  Latency Range Data Item\n   The Latency Range Data Item serves much the same
    purpose as the\n   Latency Data Item defined in [RFC8175] with the addition of
    being\n   able to communicate the latency range that can be experienced by\n   traffic
    on a link.  The Latency Range Data Item MUST be included in\n   the Session Initialization
    Response Message, with default values to\n   be used on a session-wide basis.
    \ The Latency Range Data Item also\n   MAY be carried in any message where the
    Latency Data Item [RFC8175]\n   is allowed and is carried as an additional data
    item.  When present,\n   the Latency Range Data Item MUST be processed according
    to the same\n   rules as the Latency Data Item defined in [RFC8175].\n   The format
    of the Latency Range Data Item is:\n   0                   1                   2
    \                  3\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
    7 8 9 0 1\n   | Data Item Type                | Length                        |\n
    \  |                        Maximum Latency                        :\n   :                        Maximum
    Latency                        |\n   |                        Minimum Latency
    \                       :\n   :                        Minimum Latency                        |\n
    \  Data Item Type:\n      28\n   Length:\n      16\n   Maximum Latency:\n      A
    64-bit unsigned integer, representing the longest transmission\n      delay, in
    microseconds, that a packet encounters as it is\n      transmitted over the link.\n
    \  Minimum Latency:\n      A 64-bit unsigned integer, representing the shortest
    transmission\n      delay, in microseconds, that a packet can encounter as it
    is\n      transmitted over the link.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The extension introduces a new Data Item for
    DLEP.  The extension\n   does not inherently introduce any additional vulnerabilities
    above\n   those documented in [RFC8175].  The approach taken to security in\n
    \  that document applies equally when running the extension defined in\n   this
    document.\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   As described below, IANA has assigned two values
    per this document.\n   Both assignments are to registries defined by [RFC8175].\n"

    - "5.1.  Extension Type Value\n   IANA has assigned the following value in the
      \"Extension Type Values\"\n   registry within the \"Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol

      \  \"Specification Required\" [RFC8126] policy:\n                          |
      Code | Description   |\n                          | 4    | Latency Range |\n
