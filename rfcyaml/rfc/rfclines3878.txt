Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for controlling the reporting of alarm conditions.
The scope of this MIB is targeted for network operators responsible for managing the operations of network resources.
This document defines an alarm reporting control (ARC)
MIB module, which provides a mechanism for a manager to suppress or defer the reporting of alarm conditions based on the resource ID and alarm condition type.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
There is a need to provide a mechanism for controlling the reporting of alarm conditions of resources in a network device.
For example, (a) inhibiting the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource until the resource is problem free, (b) inhibiting the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource for a specified time period, or (c) inhibiting the reporting of alarm conditions of a resource indefinitely until explicitly allowed by the managing system at a later time.
The alarm reporting control (ARC) feature provides an automatic in  service provisioning capability.
It allows sufficient time for service setup, customer testing, and other maintenance activities in an "alarm free" state.
Once a resource is "problem free", alarm reporting can be automatically or manually turned on (i.e., allowed).
By putting a network resource in ARC mode, (i.e., in nalm, nalmTI, nalmQI, or nalmQICD states, as described in the MIB), the technicians and managing systems will not be flooded with unnecessary work items during operations activities such as service provisioning and network setup/teardown.
This will reduce maintenance costs and improve the operation and maintenance of these systems.
Putting a network resource in ARC mode shall not affect the availability of active alarm condition information for potential retrieval.
ITU T Recommendation M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3] provides the business requirements, analysis, and design of the Alarm Reporting Control feature.
This document defines the MIB objects to support a subset of the ARC functions described in M.3100 Amd3.
In particular, it defines a table that can be used to specify the ARC settings for the resources in a system.
Defined in M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3], there are five ARC states: alm, nalm, nalmQI, nalmQICD and nalmTI.
In the ARC MIB module, the arcState object is defined to model the M.3100 ARC states.
Note that the state alm (alarm reporting is allowed) is not listed in the enumeration of the value of this object.
However, this state is implicitly supported by the mib.
Once a resource enters the normal reporting mode (i.e., into the alm state) for the specified alarm type, the corresponding row will be automatically deleted from the arc table.
Also the manual setting of arcState to alm can be achieved through setting the RowStatus object to 'destroy'.
The ARC MIB module defined in this document provides a way to control the reporting of alarm conditions.
A set of applicable alarm conditions is defined in ITU T Recommendation M.3100 [M.3100] and is named "probable causes".
These probable causes (alarm conditions) have been included in the IANAItuProbableCause TC, which is defined in the IANA ITU ALARM TC MIB module [RFC3877].
The IANA ITU ALARM TC MIB module is maintained in the IANA web site [ITUALARMTC].
The ARC MIB module defines an IANAItuProbableCauseOrZero TC which can take any value of IANAItuProbableCause or 0.
The ARC MIB module further uses IANAItuProbableCauseOrZero to define the ARC settings for the managed resource in the network elements.
Specification of objects for defining and storing alarms, including active and history alarms, standing and transient alarms, and alarm notifications are out of the scope of this document.
Relationship between ARC mode and alarm reporting When the ARC MIB module is used in a managed system, the following rules apply: For alarm condition raised prior to entering ARC mode, reporting of alarm raised and alarm cleared will be sent as usual.
For alarm condition raised after entering ARC mode and also cleared before exiting ARC mode, no reporting of alarm raised will be sent and no reporting of alarm cleared will be sent.
For alarm condition raised after entering ARC mode and not cleared when exiting ARC mode, the reporting of alarm raised will be deferred until the moment of exiting ARC mode.
The reporting of alarm cleared will be sent as usual (i.e., at the time of alarm cleared).
Further details of the ARC function can be found in M.3100 Amd3 [M.3100 Amd3].

A table of Alarm Reporting Control (ARC) settings on the system.
Alarm Reporting Control is a feature that provides an automatic in service provisioning capability.
Alarm reporting is turned off on a per resource basis for a selective set of potential alarm conditions to allow sufficient time for customer testing and other maintenance activities in an 'alarm free' state.
Once a resource is ready for service, alarm reporting is automatically or manually turned on.
Functional description and requirements of Alarm Reporting Control are defined in ITU T Recommendation
M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3].

current DESCRIPTION "A conceptual row that contains information about an ARC setting of a resource in the system.
Implementation need to be aware that if the total size of arcIndex and arcNotificationId exceeds 114 sub IDs, then OIDs of column instances in this table will have more than 128 sub IDs and cannot be access using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or snmpv3.
"This object uniquely identifies a resource, which is under the arcState's control for the associated arcAlarmType.
For example, if the resource is an interface, this object will point to an instance of interface, e.g., ifIndex.1."
} arcAlarmType OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"This object identifies the alarm condition type controlled by the arcState.
It specifies the value 0 or a value of IANAItuProbableCause that is applicable to the resource.
IANAItuProbableCause is defined in the IANA ITU ALARM TC module in the Alarm MIB document.
The value of zero (0) implies any probable causes that are applicable to the resource.
Usually, the applicable probable causes of a resource are specified in the resource specific mib."
"This object identifies the type of notification to be suppressed.
The notification type identified should be the one normally used by the resource for reporting its alarms.
When the value of 0.0 is specified for this object, it implies all applicable notification types."

current DESCRIPTION "Defined in M.3100 Amendment 3 [M.3100 Amd3]
, there are five ARC states: alm, nalm, nalmQI, nalmQICD, and nalmTI.
Alarm reporting is turned on (i.e., is allowed).
Alarm reporting is turned off until the managed entity is qualified problem free for an optional persistence interval.
Problem free means that the condition corresponding to the specified alarm type is cleared.
This is a substate of nalmQI and performs the persistence timing countdown function after the managed entity is qualified problem free.
Alarm reporting is turned off for a specified time interval.
alm may transition to nalm, nalmQI or nalmTI by management request.
nalm may transition to alm, nalmQI or nalmTI by management request.
nalmQI may transition to nalm or alm by management request.
nalmQI may transition to alm automatically if qualified problem free (if nalmQICD is not supported) or if the CD timer expired (if nalmQICD is supported) nalmTI may transition to alm or nalm by management request.
nalmTI may transition to alm automatically if the TI timer expired.
Further details of ARC state transitions are defined in Figure 3 of M.3100 Amd3 [M.3100 Amd3].
According to the requirements in M.3100 Amd3, a resource supporting the ARC feature shall support the alm state and at least one of the nalm, nalmTI, and nalmQI states.
The nalmQICD state is an optional substate of nalmQI.
The arcState object controls the alarm reporting state of a resource.
Note that the state alm (alarm reporting is allowed) is not listed in the enumeration of the value of this object.
However, this state is implicitly supported by the mib.
Once a resource enters the normal reporting mode (i.e., in the alm state) for the specified alarm type, the corresponding row will be automatically deleted from the arc table.
Also the manual setting of arcState to alm can be achieved through setting the RowStatus object to 'destroy'.
The nalamQICD state is a transitional state from nalmQI to alm.
It is optional depending on the resource type and the implementation of the resource.
If it is supported, before the state transitions from nalmQI to alm, a count down period is activated for a duration set by the object arcNalmCDTimeInterval.
When the time is up, the arcState transitions to alm."
"This variable indicates the time remaining in the nalmTI state or the nalmQICD state, in units of second.
At the moment the resource enters the nalmTI state, this variable will have the initial value equal to the value of arcNalmTITimeInterval and then starts decrementing as time goes by.
Similarly at the moment the resource enters the nalmQICD state, this variable will have the initial value equal to the value of arcNalmCDTimeInterval and then starts decrementing as time goes by.
This variable is read create and thus will allow the manager to write (extend or shorten), as needed, the remaining time when the resource is in the nalmTI or nalmQICD state.
RowStatus MAX ACCESS  read create
"This columnar object is used for creating and deleting a conceptual row of the arcTable.
It is used to create and delete an arc setting.
Setting RowStatus to createAndGo or createAndWait implies creating a new ARC setting for the specified resource and alarm type.
Setting RowStatus to destroy implies removing the ARC setting and thus has the effect of resuming normal reporting behaviour of the resource for the alarm type.
Only the objects arcState, arcNalmTimeRemaining, and arcRowStatus can be updated when a row is active.
All the objects, except arcNalmTimeRemaining, must be set before the row can be activated."

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: arcTITimeInterval, arcCDTimeInterval, arcState, arcNalmTimeRemaining, arcRowStatus, arcStorageType.
Setting these objects may have disruptive effects on network operation that range from omission of alarm notifications to flooding of unwanted alarm notifications from the network.
The consequence of suppressing or deferring the reporting of an alarm can prevent the timely delivery of important diagnostic information, including information that can help identify an attack.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: arcTITimeInterval, arcCDTimeInterval, arcState, arcNalmTimeRemaining, arcRowStatus, arcStorageType.
Reading these objects will provide information about the setting which affects alarm notification generation.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
