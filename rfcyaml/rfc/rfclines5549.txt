Abstract Multiprotocol BGP (MP BGP) specifies that the set of network layer protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop field may belong is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).
The current AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or VPN IPv4 NLRI.
This document specifies the extensions necessary to allow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv6 protocol.
This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop in order to determine which of the protocols the address actually belongs to, and a new BGP Capability allowing MP BGP Peers to dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6
Introduction Multiprotocol BGP (MP BGP)
[RFC4760] specifies that the set of network layer protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop field may belong is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).
A number of existing AFI/SAFIs allow the Next Hop address to belong to a different address family than the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI).
For example, the AFI/SAFI <25/65
> used (as per [L2VPN SIG])
in order to perform L2VPN auto discovery, allows advertising NLRI that contains the identifier of a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) instance or that identifies a particular pool of attachment circuits at a given Provider Edge (PE), while the Next Hop field contains the loopback address of a PE.
in order to advertise Route Target (RT) membership information, allows advertising NLRI that contains such RT membership information, while the Next Hop field contains the address of the advertising router.
Furthermore, a number of these existing AFI/SAFIs allow the Next Hop to belong to either the IPv4 Network Layer Protocol or the IPv6 Network Layer Protocol, and specify the encoding of the Next Hop information in order to determine which of the protocols the address actually belongs to.
For example, [RFC4684] allows the Next Hop address to be either IPv4 or IPv6 and states that the Next Hop field address shall be interpreted as an IPv4 address whenever the length of Next Hop address is 4 octets, and as an IPv6 address whenever the length of the Next Hop address is 16 octets.
There are situations such as those described in [RFC4925] and in [MESH FMWK] where carriers (or large enterprise networks acting as carrier for their internal resources) may be required to establish connectivity between 'islands' of networks of one address family type across a transit core of a differing address family type.
This includes both the case of IPv6 islands across an IPv4 core and the case of IPv4 islands across an IPv6 core.
Where Multiprotocol BGP (MP BGP) is used to advertise the corresponding reachability information, this translates into the requirement for a BGP speaker to advertise Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) of a given address family via a Next Hop of a different address family (i.e., IPv6 NLRI with IPv4 Next Hop and IPv4 NLRI with IPv6 Next Hop).
The current AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv6 address family assume that the Next Hop address belongs to the IPv6 address family type.
Specifically, as per [RFC2545] and [RFC3107], when the <AFI/SAFI> is <2/1
>, the Next Hop address is assumed to be of IPv6 type.
As per [RFC4659], when the <AFI/SAFI> is <2/128
>, the Next Hop address is assumed to be of IPv6 VPN type.
specify how an IPv4 address can be encoded inside the Next Hop IPv6 address field when IPv6 NLRI needs to be advertised with an IPv4 Next Hop.
[RFC4798] defines how the IPv4 mapped IPv6 address format specified in the IPv6 addressing architecture ([RFC4291])
can be used for that purpose when the <AFI/ SAFI> is <2/1
[RFC4659] defines how the IPv4  mapped IPv6 address format as well as a null Route Distinguisher can be used for that purpose when the <AFI/SAFI> is <2/128
Thus, there are existing solutions for the advertisement of IPv6 NLRI with an IPv4 Next Hop.
Similarly, the current AFI/SAFI definitions for advertisement of IPv4 NLRI or
VPN IPv4 NLRI assume that the Next Hop address belongs to the IPv4 address family type.
Specifically, as per [RFC4760] and [RFC3107], when the <AFI/SAFI> is <1/1
>, the Next Hop address is assumed to be of IPv4 type.
As per [RFC4364], when the <AFI/SAFI> is <1/128>
, the Next Hop address is assumed to be of VPN IPv4 type.
There is clearly no generally applicable method for encoding an IPv6 address inside the IPv4 address field of the Next Hop.
Hence, there is currently no specified solution for advertising IPv4 or VPN IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6
This document specifies the extensions necessary to do so.
This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN IPv4 NLRI to belong to either the IPv4 or the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop information in order to determine which of the protocols the address actually belongs to, and a new BGP Capability allowing MP BGP peers to dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN
IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6
The new BGP Capability allows gradual deployment of the new functionality of advertising IPv4 reachability via an IPv6
Next Hop, without any flag day nor any risk of traffic black holing.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
Extension of AFI/SAFI Definitions for the IPv4 Address Family
As mentioned earlier, MP BGP specifies that the set of network layer protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop field may belong is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).
The following current AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 NLRI or VPN IPv4 NLRI (<1/1
<1/128>) only have provisions for advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol.
This document extends the definition of the AFI/SAFI for advertisement of IPv4 NLRI and VPN IPv4 NLRI to extend the set of network layer protocols to which the Next Hop address can belong, to include IPv6 in addition to IPv4.
Specifically, this document allows advertising with [RFC4760] of an MP REACH NLRI with:
AFI   1  SAFI   1, 2, 4, or 128  Length of Next Hop Address   16 or 32
IPv6 address of next hop (potentially followed by the link local IPv6 address of the next hop).
This field is to be constructed as per Section 3 of [RFC2545].
NLRI as per current AFI/SAFI definition
This is in addition to the current mode of operation allowing advertisement of NLRI for <
> and <1/4> with a next hop address of IPv4 type and advertisement of NLRI for <AFI/ SAFI
with a next hop address of VPN IPv4 type.
The BGP speaker receiving the advertisement MUST use the Length of Next Hop Address field to determine which network layer protocol the next hop address belongs to.
When the Length of Next Hop Address field is equal to 16 or 32, the next hop address is of type IPv6.
Note that this method of using the Length of the Next Hop Address field to determine which network layer protocol the next hop address belongs to (out of the set of protocols allowed by the AFI/SAFI definition) is the same as used in [RFC4684] and [L2VPN SIG].
Use of BGP Capability Advertisement [RFC5492] defines a mechanism to allow two BGP speakers to discover if a particular capability is supported by their BGP peer and thus whether it can be used with that peer.
This document defines a new capability that can be advertised using [RFC5492] and that is referred to as the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability.
This capability allows BGP speakers to discover whether, for a given NLRI <AFI/SAFI>, a peer supports advertisement with a next hop whose network protocol is determined by the value of the Length of Next Hop Address field, as specified in Section 3.
A BGP speaker that wishes to advertise to a BGP peer an IPv6
Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or for VPN IPv4 NLRI
as per this specification MUST use the Capability Advertisement procedures defined in [RFC5492] with the Extended Next Hop Encoding Capability to establish whether its peer supports this for the NLRI AFI/SAFI pair(s) of interest.
The fields in the Capabilities
Optional Parameter MUST be set as follows:
The Capability Code field MUST be set to 5 (which indicates the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability).
The Capability Length field is set to a variable value that is the length of the Capability Value field (which follows).
Nexthop AFI N (2 octets)
each triple <NLRI AFI, NLRI SAFI, Nexthop AFI> indicates that NLRI of <
NLRI AFI / NLRI SAFI
> may be advertised with a Next Hop address belonging to the network layer protocol of Nexthop AFI.
the AFI and SAFI values are defined in the Address Family Identifier and Subsequent Address Family Identifier registries maintained by IANA.
Since this document only concerns itself with the advertisement of IPv4 NLRI and VPN IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6
Next Hop, this specification only allows the following values in the Capability Value field of the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability:  NLRI AFI   1 (IPv4)
NLRI SAFI   1, 2, 4, or 128
This specification does not propose that the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability be used with any other combinations of <NLRI AFI, NLRI SAFI, Nexthop AFI
In particular, this specification does not propose that the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability be used for NLRI AFI/SAFIs whose definition already allows use of both IPv4 and IPv6
> as defined in [RFC4684]).
Similarly, it does not propose that the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability be used for NLRI AFI/SAFIs for which there is already a solution for advertising a next hop of a different address family
with IPv4 Next Hop as per [RFC4798] and AFI/SAFI   <2/128> with IPv4 Next Hop as per [RFC4659]).
It is expected that if new AFI/SAFIs are defined in the future, their definition will have provisions (where appropriate) for both IPv4 and IPv6
Next Hops from the onset, with determination based on Length of Next Hop Address field.
Thus, new AFI/SAFIs are not expected to make use of the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability.
A BGP speaker MUST only advertise to a BGP peer the IPv4 or VPN IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6
if the BGP speaker has first ascertained via BGP Capability Advertisement that the BGP peer supports the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability for the relevant AFI/SAFI pair.
The Extended Next Hop Encoding capability provides information about next hop encoding for a given AFI/SAFI, assuming that AFI/SAFI is allowed.
It does not influence whether that AFI/SAFI is indeed allowed.
Whether a AFI/SAFI can be used between the BGP peers is purely determined through the Multiprotocol Extensions capability defined in [RFC4760].
The Extended Next Hop Encoding capability MAY be dynamically updated through the use of the Dynamic Capability capability and associated mechanisms defined in [DYN CAP].
Operations By default, if a particular BGP session is running over IPvx (where IPvx is IPv4 or IPv6), and if the BGP speaker sending an update is putting its own address in as the next hop, then the next hop address SHOULD be specified as an IPvx address, using the encoding rules specified in the AFI/SAFI definition of the NLRI being updated.
This default behavior may be overridden by policy.
When a next hop address needs to be passed along unchanged (e.g., as a Route Reflector (RR) would do), its encoding MUST NOT be changed.
If a particular RR client cannot handle that encoding (as determined by the BGP Capability Advertisement), then the NLRI in question cannot be distributed to that client.
For sound routing in certain scenarios, this will require that all the RR clients be able to handle whatever encodings any of them may generate.
The extensions defined in this document may be used as discussed in [MESH FMWK] for the interconnection of IPV4 islands over an IPv6 backbone.
In this application, Address Family Border Routers (AFBRs; as defined in [RFC4925]) advertise IPv4 NLRI in the MP REACH NLRI along with an IPv6
The MP REACH NLRI is encoded with:
AFI   1  SAFI   1  Length of Next Hop Network Address   16 (or 32)  Network Address of Next Hop
IPv6 address of Next Hop  NLRI   IPv4 routes During BGP Capability Advertisement, the PE routers would include the following fields in the Capabilities
Capability Code set to "Extended Next Hop Encoding"  Capability Value containing <NLRI AFI 1, NLRI SAFI 1, Nexthop AFI 2
IPv4 VPN over IPv6 Core
The extensions defined in this document may be used for support of IPV4 VPNs over an IPv6 backbone.
In this application, PE routers would advertise VPN IPv4 NLRI in the MP REACH NLRI along with an IPv6
The MP REACH NLRI is encoded with:
AFI   1  SAFI   128  Length of Next Hop Network Address   16 (or 32)  Network Address of
IPv6 address of Next Hop  NLRI   IPv4 VPN routes During BGP Capability Advertisement, the PE routers would include the following fields in the Capabilities
Capability Code set to "Extended Next Hop Encoding"  Capability Value containing <NLRI AFI 1, NLRI SAFI 128, Nexthop AFI 2
This document defines, in Section 4, a new Capability Code to indicate the Extended Next Hop Encoding capability in the [RFC5492] Capabilities Optional Parameter.
The value for this new Capability Code is 5, which is in the range set aside for allocation using the "IETF Review" policy defined in [RFC5226].
This document does not raise any additional security issues beyond those of BGP 4 and the Multiprotocol extensions for BGP 4.
The same security mechanisms are applicable.
Although not expected to be the typical case, the IPv6 address used as the BGP
Next Hop Address could be an IPv4 mapped IPv6 address (as defined in [RFC4291]).
Configuration of the security mechanisms potentially deployed by the network operator (such as security checks on next hop address) need to keep this case in mind also.
