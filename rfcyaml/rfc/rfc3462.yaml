- title: 1. The Multipart/Report Content Type
  contents:
  - "1. The Multipart/Report Content Type\n   The Multipart/Report MIME content-type\
    \ is a general \"family\" or\n   \"container\" type for electronic mail reports\
    \ of any kind. Although\n   this memo defines only the use of the Multipart/Report\
    \ content-type\n   with respect to delivery status reports, mail processing programs\n\
    \   will benefit if a single content-type is used to for all kinds of\n   reports.\n\
    \   The Multipart/Report content-type is defined as follows:\n      MIME type\
    \ name: multipart\n      MIME subtype name: report\n      Required parameters:\
    \ boundary, report-type\n      Optional parameters: none\n      Encoding considerations:\
    \ 7bit should always be adequate\n      Security considerations: see section 3\
    \ of this memo\n   The syntax of Multipart/Report is identical to the Multipart/Mixed\n\
    \   content type defined in [MIME].  When used to send a report, the\n   Multipart/Report\
    \ content-type must be the top-level MIME content type\n   for any report message.\
    \  The report-type parameter identifies the\n   type of report.  The parameter\
    \ is the MIME content sub-type of the\n   second body part of the Multipart/Report.\n\
    \   User agents and gateways must be able to automatically determine that\n  \
    \ a message is a mail system report and should be processed as such.\n   Placing\
    \ the Multipart/Report as the outermost content provides a\n   mechanism whereby\
    \ an auto-processor may detect through parsing the\n   RFC 822 headers that the\
    \ message is a report.\n   The Multipart/Report content-type contains either two\
    \ or three sub-\n   parts, in the following order:\n   1) [Required] The first\
    \ body part contains human readable message.\n   The purpose of this message is\
    \ to provide an easily understood\n   description of the condition(s) that caused\
    \ the report to be\n   generated, for a human reader who may not have a user agent\
    \ capable\n   of interpreting the second section of the Multipart/Report.\n  \
    \ The text in the first section may be in any MIME standards-track\n   content-type,\
    \ charset, or language.  Where a description of the error\n   is desired in several\
    \ languages or several media, a\n   Multipart/Alternative construct may be used.\n\
    \   This body part may also be used to send detailed information that\n   cannot\
    \ be easily formatted into a Message/Report body part.\n   (2) [Required] A machine\
    \ parsable body part containing an account of\n   the reported message handling\
    \ event. The purpose of this body part is\n   to provide a machine-readable description\
    \ of the condition(s) that\n   caused the report to be generated, along with details\
    \ not present in\n   the first body part that may be useful to human experts.\
    \  An initial\n   body part, Message/delivery-status is defined in [DSN].\n  \
    \ (3) [Optional] A body part containing the returned message or a\n   portion\
    \ thereof.  This information may be useful to aid human experts\n   in diagnosing\
    \ problems.  (Although it may also be useful to allow the\n   sender to identify\
    \ the message which the report was issued, it is\n   hoped that the envelope-id\
    \ and original-recipient-address returned in\n   the Message/Report body part\
    \ will replace the traditional use of the\n   returned content for this purpose.)\n\
    \   Return of content may be wasteful of network bandwidth and a variety\n   of\
    \ implementation strategies can be used.  Generally the sender\n   should choose\
    \ the appropriate strategy and inform the recipient of\n   the required level\
    \ of returned content required.  In the absence of\n   an explicit request for\
    \ level of return of content such as that\n   provided in [DRPT], the agent that\
    \ generated the delivery service\n   report should return the full message content.\n\
    \   When 8-bit or binary data not encoded in a 7 bit form is to be\n   returned,\
    \ and the return path is not guaranteed to be 8-bit or binary\n   capable, two\
    \ options are available.  The original message MAY be re-\n   encoded into a legal\
    \ 7-bit MIME message or the Text/RFC822-Headers\n   content-type MAY be used to\
    \ return only the original message headers.\n"
- title: 2. The Text/RFC822-Headers content-type
  contents:
  - "2. The Text/RFC822-Headers content-type\n   The Text/RFC822-Headers MIME content-type\
    \ provides a mechanism to\n   label and return only the RFC 822 headers of a failed\
    \ message.  These\n   headers are not the complete message and should not be returned\
    \ as a\n   Message/RFC822. The returned headers are useful for identifying the\n\
    \   failed message and for diagnostics based on the received lines.\n   The Text/RFC822-Headers\
    \ content-type is defined as follows:\n      MIME type name: Text\n      MIME\
    \ subtype name: RFC822-Headers\n      Required parameters: None\n      Optional\
    \ parameters: None\n      Encoding considerations: 7 bit is sufficient for normal\
    \ RFC822\n                headers, however, if the headers are broken and require\n\
    \                encoding to make them legal 7 bit content, they may be\n    \
    \            encoded in quoted-printable.\n      Security considerations: See\
    \ section 3 of this memo.\n   The Text/RFC822-Headers body part should contain\
    \ all the RFC822\n   header lines from the message which caused the report.  The\
    \ RFC822\n   headers include all lines prior to the blank line in the message.\n\
    \   They include the MIME-Version and MIME Content-Headers.\n"
- title: 3. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Security Considerations\n   Automated use of report types without authentication\
    \ presents several\n   security issues.  Forging negative reports presents the\
    \ opportunity\n   for denial-of-service attacks when the reports are used for\
    \ automated\n   maintenance of directories or mailing lists.  Forging positive\n\
    \   reports may cause the sender to incorrectly believe a message was\n   delivered\
    \ when it was not.\n   A signature covering the entire multipart/report structure\
    \ could be\n   used to prevent such forgeries; such a signature scheme is, however,\n\
    \   beyond the scope of this document.\n"
