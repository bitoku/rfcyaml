Abstract This document provides the External Data Representation Standard (XDR) description for Network File System version 4
This document provides the External Data Representation Standard (XDR) description for Network File System version 4
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].
The XDR description and scripts for extracting the XDR description are Code Components as described in Section 4 of "Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents" [2].
This document contains the XDR ([3]) description of NFSv4.1 protocol ([4]).
In order to facilitate implementations that support both NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1, the description includes operations and other features of NFSv4.0 that do not apply to NFSv4.1.
The XDR description is provided in this document in a way that makes it simple for the reader to extract into ready to compile form.
The reader can feed this document in the following shell script to produce the machine readable XDR description of NFSv4.1: <CODE BEGINS> #!
That is, if the above script is stored in a file called "extract.sh", and this document is in a file called "spec.txt", then the reader can do: <CODE BEGINS> sh extract.sh < spec.txt > nfs4
The XDR description, with the sentinel sequence follows: <
