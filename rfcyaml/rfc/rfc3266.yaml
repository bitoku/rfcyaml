  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the use of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)\n\
    \   addresses in conjunction with the Session Description Protocol (SDP).\n  \
    \ Specifically, this document clarifies existing text in SDP with\n   regards\
    \ to the syntax of IPv6 addresses.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   SDP is intended for describing multimedia sessions for the\
    \ purposes\n   of session announcement, session invitation, and other forms of\n\
    \   multimedia session initiation.  It is a text format description that\n   provides\
    \ many details of a multimedia session including: the\n   originator of the session,\
    \ a URL related to the session, the\n   connection address for the session media(s),\
    \ and optional attributes\n   for the session media(s).  Each of these pieces\
    \ of information may\n   involve one or more IPv6 addresses.  The ABNF for IP\
    \ addresses in SDP\n   currently leaves the syntax for IPv6 addresses undefined.\
    \  This\n   document attempts to complete the ABNF to include IPv6 addresses.\n\
    \   Accordingly, the address type \"IP6\" indicating an IPv6 address,\n   should\
    \ be allowed in the connection field, \"c=\", of the SDP.  The\n   ABNF already\
    \ reflects this, though the \"Connection Data\" text under\n   section 6 of RFC\
    \ 2328 currently only defines the \"IP4\" address type.\n"

  - "2. Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [5].\n"
- title: 3. Syntax

  - "3. Syntax\n   RFC 2373 [1] gives an ABNF for the text representation of IPv6\n\
    \   addresses in Appendix B.  RFC 2732 [3] covers the text representation\n  \
    \ of IPv6 addresses when used within a URL.  Using the ABNF described\n   in these\
    \ documents, the following updated ABNF for SDP is proposed.\n      uri =    \

  - "5. Note for implementors\n   An implementation may receive an SDP session description\
    \ with an IPv6\n   address whose format [1] is internally that of an IPv4 mapped\n\
    \   address.  Note that such an address is actually the address of an\n   IPv4-only\
    \ node, and implementors are warned to interpret IPv4 mapped\n   addresses as\
    \ equivalent to IP4.\n"
