    \  and accurately shift traffic away from either a point-to-point or\n   multi-access
    LAN interface during network maintenance or other\n   operational events.  This
    is accomplished by signaling adjacent IS-IS\n   neighbors with a higher reverse
    metric, i.e., the metric towards the\n   signaling IS-IS router.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IS-IS [ISO10589] routing protocol has been widely used
    in\n   Internet Service Provider IP/MPLS networks.  Operational experience\n   with
    the protocol combined with ever increasing requirements for\n   lossless operations
    have demonstrated some operational issues.  This\n   document describes the issues
    and a mechanism for mitigating them.\n   This document defines the IS-IS \"Reverse
    Metric\" mechanism that\n   allows an IS-IS node to send a Reverse Metric TLV
    through the IS-IS\n   Hello (IIH) PDU to the neighbor or pseudonode to adjust
    the routing\n   metric on the inbound direction.\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Node and Link Isolation\n   The IS-IS routing mechanism has the overload
      bit, which can be used\n   by operators to perform disruptive maintenance on
      the router.  But in\n   many operational maintenance cases, it is not necessary
      to divert all\n   the traffic away from this node.  It is necessary to avoid
      only a\n   single link during the maintenance.  More detailed descriptions of\n
      \  the challenges can be found in Appendices A and B of this document.\n"

    - "1.2.  Distributed Forwarding Planes\n   In a distributed forwarding platform,
      different forwarding line cards\n   may have interfaces and IS-IS connections
      to neighbor routers.  If\n   one of the line card's software resets, it may
      take some time for the\n   forwarding entries to be fully populated on the line
      card, in\n   particular if the router is a PE (Provider Edge) router in an ISP's\n
      \  MPLS VPN.  An IS-IS adjacency may be established with a neighbor\n   router
      long before the entire BGP VPN prefixes are downloaded to the\n   forwarding
      table.  It is important to signal to the adjacent IS-IS\n   routers to raise
      metric values and not to use the corresponding IS-IS\n   adjacency inbound to
      this router if possible.  Temporarily signaling\n   the 'Reverse Metric' over
      this link to discourage the traffic via the\n   corresponding line card will
      help to reduce the traffic loss in the\n   network.  In the meantime, the remote
      PE routers will select a\n   different set of PE routers for the BGP best path
      calculation or use\n   a different link towards the same PE router on which
      a line card is\n   resetting.\n"

      the leaf nodes will\n   perform equal-cost or unequal-cost load sharing towards
      all the spine\n   nodes.  In certain operational cases, for instance, when one
      of the\n   backbone links on a spine node is congested, a spine node can push
      a\n   higher metric towards the connected leaf nodes to reduce the transit\n
      \  traffic through the corresponding spine node or link.\n"

    - "1.4.  LDP IGP Synchronization\n   In [RFC5443], a mechanism is described to
      achieve LDP IGP\n   synchronization by using the maximum link metric value on
      the\n   interface.  But in the case of a new IS-IS node joining the broadcast\n
      \  network (LAN), it is not optimal to change all the nodes on the LAN\n   to
      the maximum link metric value, as described in [RFC6138].  In this\n   case,
      the Reverse Metric can be used to discourage both outbound and\n   inbound traffic
      without affecting the traffic of other IS-IS nodes on\n   the LAN.\n"

    - "1.5.  IS-IS Reverse Metric\n   This document uses the routing protocol itself
      as the transport\n   mechanism to allow one IS-IS router to advertise a \"reverse
      metric\"\n   in an IS-IS Hello (IIH) PDU to an adjacent node on a point-to-point\n
      \  or multi-access LAN link.  This would allow the provisioning to be\n   performed
      only on a single node, setting a \"reverse metric\" on a link\n   and having
      traffic bidirectionally shift away from that link\n   gracefully to alternate
      viable paths.\n   This Reverse Metric mechanism is used for both point-to-point
      and\n   multi-access LAN links.  Unlike the point-to-point links, the IS-IS\n
      \  protocol currently does not have a way to influence the traffic\n   towards
      a particular node on LAN links.  This mechanism provides\n   IS-IS routing with
      the capability of altering traffic in both\n   directions on either a point-to-point
      link or a multi-access link of\n   an IS-IS node.\n   The metric value in the
      Reverse Metric TLV and the Traffic\n   Engineering metric in the sub-TLV being
      advertised are offsets or\n   relative metrics to be added to the existing local
      link and Traffic\n   Engineering metric values of the receiver; the accumulated
      metric\n   value is bounded as described in Section 2.\n"

    add to the existing configured\n   Default Metric for the IS-IS link [ISO10589].
    \ Refer to \"Elements of\n   Procedure\" in Section 3 of this document for details
    on how an IS-IS\n   router should process the Metric field in a Reverse Metric
    TLV.\n   The Metric field, in the Reverse Metric TLV, is a \"reverse offset\n
    \  metric\" that will either be in the range of 0 - 63 when a \"narrow\"\n   IS-IS
    metric is used (IS Neighbors TLV / Pseudonode LSP) [RFC1195] or\n   in the range
    of 0 - (2^24 - 2) when a \"wide\" Traffic Engineering\n   metric value is used
    (Extended IS Reachability TLV) [RFC5305]\n   [RFC5817].  As described below, when
    the U bit is set, the\n   accumulated value of the wide metric is in the range
    of\n   0 - (2^24 - 1), with the (2^24 - 1) metric value as non-reachable in\n
    \  IS-IS routing.  The IS-IS metric value of (2^24 - 2) serves as the\n   link
    of last resort.\n   There are currently only two Flag bits defined.\n   W bit
    (0x01): The \"Whole LAN\" bit is only used in the context of\n   multi-access
    LANs.  When a Reverse Metric TLV is transmitted from a\n   node to the Designated
    Intermediate System (DIS), if the \"Whole LAN\"\n   bit is set (1), then a DIS
    SHOULD add the received Metric value in\n   the Reverse Metric TLV to each node's
    existing Default Metric in the\n   Pseudonode LSP.  If the \"Whole LAN\" bit is
    not set (0), then a DIS\n   SHOULD add the received Metric value in the Reverse
    Metric TLV to the\n   existing \"default metric\" in the Pseudonode LSP for the
    single node\n   from whom the Reverse Metric TLV was received.  Please refer to\n
    \  \"Multi-access LAN Procedures\", in Section 3.3, for additional\n   details.
    \ The W bit MUST be clear when a Reverse Metric TLV is\n   transmitted in an IIH
    PDU on a point-to-point link and MUST be\n   ignored when received on a point-to-point
    link.\n   U bit (0x02): The \"Unreachable\" bit specifies that the metric\n   calculated
    by the addition of the reverse metric to the \"default\n   metric\" is limited
    to the maximum value of (2^24-1).  This \"U\" bit\n   applies to both the default
    metric in the Extended IS Reachability\n   TLV and the Traffic Engineering Default
    Metric sub-TLV of the link.\n   This is only relevant to the IS-IS \"wide\" metric
    mode.\n   The Reserved bits of Flags field MUST be set to zero and MUST be\n   ignored
    when received.\n   The Reverse Metric TLV MAY include sub-TLVs when an IS-IS router\n
    \  wishes to signal additional information to its neighbor.  In this\n   document,
    the Reverse Metric Traffic Engineering Metric sub-TLV, with\n   Type 18, is defined.
    \ This Traffic Engineering Metric contains a\n   24-bit unsigned integer.  This
    sub-TLV is optional; if it appears\n   more than once, then the entire Reverse
    Metric TLV MUST be ignored.\n   Upon receiving this Traffic Engineering METRIC
    sub-TLV in a Reverse\n   Metric TLV, a node SHOULD add the received Traffic Engineering
    Metric\n   offset value to its existing configured Traffic Engineering Default\n
    \  Metric within its Extended IS Reachability TLV.  The use of other\n   sub-TLVs
    is outside the scope of this document.  The \"sub-TLV Len\"\n   value MUST be
    set to zero when an IS-IS router does not have Traffic\n   Engineering sub-TLVs
    that it wishes to send to its IS-IS neighbor.\n"

    - "3.1.  Processing Changes to Default Metric\n   It is important to use the same
      IS-IS metric type on both ends of the\n   link and in the entire IS-IS area
      or level.  On the receiving side of\n   the 'reverse-metric' TLV, the accumulated
      value of the configured\n   metric and the reverse-metric needs to be limited
      to 63 in \"narrow\"\n   metric mode and to (2^24 - 2) in \"wide\" metric mode.
      \ This applies to\n   both the Default Metric of Extended IS Reachability TLV
      and the\n   Traffic Engineering Default Metric sub-TLV in LSP or Pseudonode
      LSP\n   for the \"wide\" metric mode case.  If the \"U\" bit is present in the\n
      \  flags, the accumulated metric value is to be limited to (2^24 - 1)\n   for
      both the normal link metric and Traffic Engineering metric in\n   IS-IS \"wide\"
      metric mode.\n   If an IS-IS router is configured to originate a Traffic Engineering\n
      \  Default Metric sub-TLV for a link but receives a Reverse Metric TLV\n   from
      its neighbor that does not contain a Traffic Engineering Default\n   Metric
      sub-TLV, then the IS-IS router MUST NOT change the value of\n   its Traffic
      Engineering Default Metric sub-TLV for that link.\n"

    - "3.2.  Multi-Topology IS-IS Support on Point-to-Point Links\n   The Reverse
      Metric TLV is applicable to Multi-topology IS-IS (M-ISIS)\n   [RFC5120].  On
      point-to-point links, if an IS-IS router is configured\n   for M-ISIS, it MUST
      send only a single Reverse Metric TLV in IIH PDUs\n   toward its neighbor(s)
      on the designated link.  When an M-ISIS router\n   receives a Reverse Metric
      TLV, it MUST add the received Metric value\n   to its Default Metric of the
      link in all Extended IS Reachability\n   TLVs for all topologies.  If an M-ISIS
      router receives a Reverse\n   Metric TLV with a Traffic Engineering Default
      Metric sub-TLV, then\n   the M-ISIS router MUST add the received Traffic Engineering
      Default\n   Metric value to each of its Default Metric sub-TLVs in all of its
      MT\n   Intermediate Systems TLVs.  If an M-ISIS router is configured to\n   advertise
      Traffic Engineering Default Metric sub-TLVs for one or more\n   topologies but
      does not receive a Traffic Engineering Default Metric\n   sub-TLV in a Reverse
      Metric TLV, then the M-ISIS router MUST NOT\n   change the value in each of
      the Traffic Engineering Default Metric\n   sub-TLVs for all topologies.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Multi-access LAN Procedures\n   On a Multi-access LAN, only the DIS SHOULD
      act upon information\n   contained in a received Reverse Metric TLV.  All non-DIS
      nodes MUST\n   silently ignore a received Reverse Metric TLV.  The decision
      process\n   of the routers on the LAN MUST follow the procedure in\n   Section
      7.2.8.2 of [ISO10589], and use the \"Two-way connectivity\n   check\" during
      the topology and route calculation.\n   The Reverse Metric Traffic Engineering
      sub-TLV also applies to the\n   DIS.  If a DIS is configured to apply Traffic
      Engineering over a link\n   and it receives Traffic Engineering Metric sub-TLV
      in a Reverse\n   Metric TLV, it should update the Traffic Engineering Default
      Metric\n   sub-TLV value of the corresponding Extended IS Reachability TLV or\n
      \  insert a new one if not present.\n   In the case of multi-access LANs, the
      \"W\" Flags bit is used to signal\n   from a non-DIS to the DIS whether or not
      to change the metric and,\n   optionally, Traffic Engineering parameters for
      all nodes in the\n   Pseudonode LSP or solely the node on the LAN originating
      the Reverse\n   Metric TLV.\n   A non-DIS node, e.g., Router B, attached to
      a multi-access LAN will\n   send the DIS a Reverse Metric TLV with the W bit
      clear when Router B\n   wishes the DIS to add the Metric value to the Default
      Metric\n   contained in the Pseudonode LSP specific to just Router B.  Other\n
      \  non-DIS nodes, e.g., Routers C and D, may simultaneously send a\n   Reverse
      Metric TLV with the W bit clear to request the DIS to add\n   their own Metric
      value to their Default Metric contained in the\n   Pseudonode LSP.\n   As long
      as at least one IS-IS node on the LAN sending the signal to\n   DIS with the
      W bit set, the DIS would add the metric value in the\n   Reverse Metric TLV
      to all neighbor adjacencies in the Pseudonode LSP,\n   regardless if some of
      the nodes on the LAN advertise the Reverse\n   Metric TLV without the W bit
      set.  The DIS MUST use the reverse\n   metric of the highest source MAC address
      Non-DIS advertising the\n   Reverse Metric TLV with the W bit set.\n   Local
      provisioning on the DIS to adjust the Default Metric(s) is\n   another way to
      insert Reverse Metric in the Pseudonode LSP towards an\n   IS-IS node on a LAN.
      \ In the case where a Reverse Metric TLV is also\n   used in the IS-IS Hello
      PDU of the node, the local provisioning MUST\n   take precedence over received
      Reverse Metric TLVs.  For instance,\n   local policy on the DIS may be provisioned
      to ignore the W bit\n   signaling on a LAN.\n   Multi-topology IS-IS [RFC5120]
      specifies there is no change to\n   construction of the Pseudonode LSP regardless
      of the Multi-topology\n   (MT) capabilities of a multi-access LAN.  If any MT
      capable node on\n   the LAN advertises the Reverse Metric TLV to the DIS, the
      DIS should\n   update, as appropriate, the Default Metric contained in the\n
      \  Pseudonode LSP.  If the DIS updates the Default Metric and floods a\n   new
      Pseudonode LSP, those default metric values will be applied to\n   all topologies
      during Multi-topology Shortest Path First\n   calculations.\n"

    - "3.4.  LDP/IGP Synchronization on LANs\n   As described in [RFC6138], when a
      new IS-IS node joins a broadcast\n   network, it is unnecessary and sometimes
      even harmful for all IS-IS\n   nodes on the LAN to advertise the maximum link
      metric.  [RFC6138]\n   proposes a solution to have the new node not advertise
      its adjacency\n   towards the pseudonode when it is not in a \"cut-edge\" position.\n
      \  With the introduction of Reverse Metric in this document, a simpler\n   alternative
      solution to the above mentioned problem can be used.  The\n   Reverse Metric
      allows the new node on the LAN to advertise its\n   inbound metric value to
      be the maximum, and this puts the link of\n   this new node in the last resort
      position without impacting the other\n   IS-IS nodes on the same LAN.\n   Specifically,
      when IS-IS adjacencies are being established by the new\n   node on the LAN,
      besides setting the maximum link metric value\n   (2^24 - 2) on the interface
      of the LAN for LDP IGP synchronization as\n   described in [RFC5443], it SHOULD
      advertise the maximum metric offset\n   value in the Reverse Metric TLV in its
      IIH PDU sent on the LAN.  It\n   SHOULD continue this advertisement until it

    - "3.5.  Operational Guidelines\n   For the use case in Section 1.1, a router
      SHOULD limit the period of\n   advertising a Reverse Metric TLV towards a neighbor
      only for the\n   duration of a network maintenance window.\n   The use of a
      Reverse Metric does not alter IS-IS metric parameters\n   stored in a router's
      persistent provisioning database.\n   If routers that receive a Reverse Metric
      TLV send a syslog message or\n   SNMP trap, this will assist in rapidly identifying
      the node in the\n   network that is advertising an IS-IS metric or Traffic Engineering\n
      \  parameters different from that which is configured locally on the\n   device.\n
      \  When the link Traffic Engineering metric is raised to (2^24 - 1)\n   [RFC5817],
      either due to the Reverse Metric mechanism or by explicit\n   user configuration,
      this SHOULD immediately trigger the CSPF\n   (Constrained Shortest Path First)
      recalculation to move the Traffic\n   Engineering traffic away from that link.
      \ It is RECOMMENDED also that\n   the CSPF does the immediate CSPF recalculation
      when the Traffic\n   Engineering metric is raised to (2^24 - 2) to be the last
      resort\n   link.\n   It is advisable that implementations provide a configuration\n
      \  capability to disable any IS-IS metric changes by a Reverse Metric\n   mechanism
      through neighbors' Hello PDUs.\n   If an implementation enables this mechanism
      by default, it is\n   RECOMMENDED that it be disabled by the operators when
      not explicitly\n   using it.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Node Isolation Challenges\n   On rare occasions, it is necessary
    for an operator to perform\n   disruptive network maintenance on an entire IS-IS
    router node, i.e.,\n   major software upgrades, power/cooling augments, etc.  In
    these\n   cases, an operator will set the IS-IS Overload Bit (OL bit) within\n
    \  the Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) of the IS-IS router about\n   to
    undergo maintenance.  The IS-IS router immediately floods its\n   updated LSPs
    to all IS-IS routers in the IS-IS domain.  Upon receipt\n   of the updated LSPs,
    all IS-IS routers recalculate their Shortest\n   Path First (SPF) tree excluding
    IS-IS routers whose LSPs have the OL\n   bit set.  This effectively removes the
    IS-IS router about to undergo\n   maintenance from the topology, thus preventing
    it from receiving any\n   transit traffic during the maintenance period.\n   After
    the maintenance activity has completed, the operator resets the\n   IS-IS Overload
    Bit within the LSPs of the original IS-IS router\n   causing it to flood updated
    IS-IS LSPs throughout the IS-IS domain.\n   All IS-IS routers recalculate their
    SPF tree and now include the\n   original IS-IS router in their topology calculations,
    allowing it to\n   be used for transit traffic again.\n   Isolating an entire
    IS-IS router from the topology can be especially\n   disruptive due to the displacement
    of a large volume of traffic\n   through an entire IS-IS router to other suboptimal
    paths (e.g., those\n   with significantly larger delay).  Thus, in the majority
    of network\n   maintenance scenarios, where only a single link or LAN needs to
    be\n   augmented to increase its physical capacity, or is experiencing an\n   intermittent
    failure, it is much more common and desirable to\n   gracefully remove just the
    targeted link or LAN from service\n   temporarily, so that the least amount of
    user-data traffic is\n   affected during the link-specific network maintenance.\n"
  title: Appendix A.  Node Isolation Challenges

  - "Appendix B.  Link Isolation Challenges\n   Before network maintenance events
    are performed on individual\n   physical links or LANs, operators substantially
    increase the IS-IS\n   metric simultaneously on both devices attached to the same
    link or\n   LAN.  In doing so, the devices generate new Link State Protocol Data\n
    \  Units (LSPs) that are flooded throughout the network and cause all\n   routers
    to gradually shift traffic onto alternate paths with very\n   little or no disruption
    to in-flight communications by applications\n   or end users.  When performed
    successfully, this allows the operator\n   to confidently perform disruptive augmentation,
    fault diagnosis, or\n   repairs on a link without disturbing ongoing communications
    in the\n   network.\n   There are a number of challenges with the above solution.
    \ First, it\n   is quite common to have routers with several hundred interfaces
    and\n   individual interfaces that move anywhere from several hundred\n   gigabits/second
    to terabits/second of traffic.  Thus, it is\n   imperative that operators accurately
    identify the same point-to-point\n   link on two separate devices in order to
    increase (and afterward\n   decrease) the IS-IS metric appropriately.  Second,
    the aforementioned\n   solution is very time-consuming and even more error-prone
    to perform\n   when it's necessary to temporarily remove a multi-access LAN from
    the\n   network topology.  Specifically, the operator needs to configure ALL\n
    \  devices that have interfaces attached to the multi-access LAN with an\n   appropriately
    high IS-IS metric (and then decrease the IS-IS metric\n   to its original value
    afterward).  Finally, with respect to multi-\n   access LANs, there is currently
    no method to bidirectionally isolate\n   only a single node's interface on the
    LAN when performing more fine-\n   grained diagnoses and repairs to the multi-access
    LAN.\n   In theory, use of a Network Management System (NMS) could improve the\n
    \  accuracy of identifying the appropriate subset of routers attached to\n   either
    a point-to-point link or a multi-access LAN.  It could also\n   signal to those
    devices, using a network management protocol, to\n   adjust the IS-IS metrics
    on the pertinent set of interfaces.  The\n   reality is that NMSs are, to a very
    large extent, not used within\n   Service Provider's networks for a variety of
    reasons.  In particular,\n   NMSs do not interoperate very well across different
    vendors or even\n   separate platform families within the same vendor.\n"
