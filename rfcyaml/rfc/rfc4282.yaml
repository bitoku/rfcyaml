  - "1.  Introduction\n   Considerable interest exists for a set of features that\
    \ fit within\n   the general category of \"roaming capability\" for network access,\n\
    \   including dialup Internet users, Virtual Private Network (VPN) usage,\n  \
    \ wireless LAN authentication, and other applications.  Interested\n   parties\
    \ have included the following:\n   o  Regional Internet Service Providers (ISPs)\
    \ operating within a\n      particular state or province, looking to combine their\
    \ efforts\n      with those of other regional providers to offer dialup service\n\
    \      over a wider area.\n   o  National ISPs wishing to combine their operations\
    \ with those of\n      one or more ISPs in another nation to offer more comprehensive\n\
    \      dialup service in a group of countries or on a continent.\n   o  Wireless\
    \ LAN hotspots providing service to one or more ISPs.\n   o  Businesses desiring\
    \ to offer their employees a comprehensive\n      package of dialup services on\
    \ a global basis.  Those services may\n      include Internet access as well as\
    \ secure access to corporate\n      intranets via a VPN, enabled by tunneling\
    \ protocols such as the\n      Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) [RFC2637],\
    \ the Layer 2\n      Forwarding (L2F) protocol [RFC2341], the Layer 2 Tunneling\n\
    \      Protocol (L2TP) [RFC2661], and the IPsec tunnel mode [RFC2401].\n   In\
    \ order to enhance the interoperability of roaming services, it is\n   necessary\
    \ to have a standardized method for identifying users.  This\n   document defines\
    \ syntax for the Network Access Identifier (NAI).\n   Examples of implementations\
    \ that use the NAI, and descriptions of its\n   semantics, can be found in [RFC2194].\n\
    \   This document is a revised version of RFC 2486 [RFC2486], which\n   originally\
    \ defined NAIs.  Differences and enhancements compared to\n   RFC 2486 are listed\
    \ in Appendix A.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   This document frequently uses the following terms:\n  \
    \ Network Access Identifier\n      The Network Access Identifier (NAI) is the\
    \ user identity submitted\n      by the client during network access authentication.\
    \  In roaming,\n      the purpose of the NAI is to identify the user as well as\
    \ to\n      assist in the routing of the authentication request.  Please note\n\
    \      that the NAI may not necessarily be the same as the user's e-mail\n   \
    \   address or the user identity submitted in an application layer\n      authentication.\n\
    \   Network Access Server\n      The Network Access Server (NAS) is the device\
    \ that clients connect\n      to in order to get access to the network.  In PPTP\
    \ terminology,\n      this is referred to as the PPTP Access Concentrator (PAC),\
    \ and in\n      L2TP terminology, it is referred to as the L2TP Access\n     \
    \ Concentrator (LAC).  In IEEE 802.11, it is referred to as an\n      Access Point.\n\
    \   Roaming Capability\n      Roaming capability can be loosely defined as the\
    \ ability to use\n      any one of multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs),\
    \ while\n      maintaining a formal, customer-vendor relationship with only one.\n\
    \      Examples of cases where roaming capability might be required\n      include\
    \ ISP \"confederations\" and ISP-provided corporate network\n      access support.\n\
    \   Tunneling Service\n      A tunneling service is any network service enabled\
    \ by tunneling\n      protocols such as PPTP, L2F, L2TP, and IPsec tunnel mode.\
    \  One\n      example of a tunneling service is secure access to corporate\n \
    \     intranets via a Virtual Private Network (VPN).\n"
- title: 1.2.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Requirements Language\n   In this document, the key words \"MAY\", \"MUST,\
    \ \"MUST NOT\", \"OPTIONAL\",\n   \"RECOMMENDED\", \"SHOULD\", and \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , are to be interpreted as\n   described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Purpose
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Purpose\n   As described in [RFC2194], there are a number of providers\
    \ offering\n   network access services, and the number of Internet Service Providers\n\
    \   involved in roaming consortia is increasing rapidly.\n   In order to be able\
    \ to offer roaming capability, one of the\n   requirements is to be able to identify\
    \ the user's home authentication\n   server.  For use in roaming, this function\
    \ is accomplished via the\n   Network Access Identifier (NAI) submitted by the\
    \ user to the NAS in\n   the initial network authentication.  It is also expected\
    \ that NASes\n   will use the NAI as part of the process of opening a new tunnel,\
    \ in\n   order to determine the tunnel endpoint.\n"

- title: 2.2.  NAI Length Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.2.  NAI Length Considerations\n   Devices handling NAIs MUST support an NAI\
    \ length of at least 72\n   octets.  Support for an NAI length of 253 octets is\
    \ RECOMMENDED.\n   However, the following implementation issues should be considered:\n\
    \   o  NAIs are often transported in the User-Name attribute of the\n      Remote\
    \ Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol.\n      Unfortunately,\
    \ RFC 2865 [RFC2865], Section 5.1, states that \"the\n      ability to handle\
    \ at least 63 octets is recommended.\"  As a\n      result, it may not be possible\
    \ to transfer NAIs beyond 63 octets\n      through all devices.  In addition,\
    \ since only a single User-Name\n      attribute may be included in a RADIUS message\
    \ and the maximum\n      attribute length is 253 octets; RADIUS is unable to support\
    \ NAI\n      lengths beyond 253 octets.\n   o  NAIs can also be transported in\
    \ the User-Name attribute of\n      Diameter [RFC3588], which supports content\
    \ lengths up to 2^24 - 9\n      octets.  As a result, NAIs processed only by Diameter\
    \ nodes can be\n      very long.  Unfortunately, an NAI transported over Diameter\
    \ may\n      eventually be translated to RADIUS, in which case the above\n   \
    \   limitations apply.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Support for Username Privacy
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Support for Username Privacy\n   Interpretation of the username part of\
    \ the NAI depends on the realm\n   in question.  Therefore, the \"username\" part\
    \ SHOULD be treated as\n   opaque data when processed by nodes that are not a\
    \ part of the\n   authoritative domain (in the sense of Section 4) for that realm.\n\
    \   In some situations, NAIs are used together with a separate\n   authentication\
    \ method that can transfer the username part in a more\n   secure manner to increase\
    \ privacy.  In this case, NAIs MAY be\n   provided in an abbreviated form by omitting\
    \ the username part.\n   Omitting the username part is RECOMMENDED over using\
    \ a fixed username\n   part, such as \"anonymous\", since it provides an unambiguous\
    \ way to\n   determine whether the username is intended to uniquely identify a\n\
    \   single user.\n   For roaming purposes, it is typically necessary to locate\
    \ the\n   appropriate backend authentication server for the given NAI before\n\
    \   the authentication conversation can proceed.  As a result, the realm\n   portion\
    \ is typically required in order for the authentication\n   exchange to be routed\
    \ to the appropriate server.\n"
- title: 2.4.  International Character Sets
  contents:
  - "2.4.  International Character Sets\n   This specification allows both international\
    \ usernames and realms.\n   International usernames are based on the use of Unicode\
    \ characters,\n   encoded as UTF-8 and processed with a certain algorithm to ensure\
    \ a\n   canonical representation.  Internationalization of the realm portion\n\
    \   of the NAI is based on \"Internationalizing Domain Names in\n   Applications\
    \ (IDNA)\" [RFC3490].\n   In order to ensure a canonical representation, characters\
    \ of the\n   username portion in an NAI MUST fulfill the ABNF in this\n   specification\
    \ as well as the requirements specified in [RFC4013].\n   These requirements consist\
    \ of the following:\n   o  Mapping requirements, as specified in Section 2.1 of\
    \ [RFC4013].\n      Mapping consists of mapping certain characters to others (such\
    \ as\n      SPACE) in order to increase the likelihood of correctly performed\n\
    \      comparisons.\n   o  Normalization requirements, as specified in Section\
    \ 2.2 of\n      [RFC4013], are also designed to assist in comparisons.\n   o \
    \ Prohibited output.  Certain characters are not permitted in\n      correctly\
    \ formed strings that follow Section 2.3 of [RFC4013].\n      Ensuring that NAIs\
    \ conform to their ABNF is not sufficient; it is\n      also necessary to ensure\
    \ that they do not contain prohibited\n      output.\n   o  Bidirectional characters\
    \ are handled as specified in Section 2.4\n      of [RFC4013].\n   o  Unassigned\
    \ code points are specified in Section 2.5 of [RFC4013].\n      The use of unassigned\
    \ code points is prohibited.\n   The mapping, normalization, and bidirectional\
    \ character processing\n   MUST be performed by end systems that take international\
    \ text as\n   input.  In a network access setting, such systems are typically\
    \ the\n   client and the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)\n\
    \   server.  NAIs are sent over the wire in their canonical form, and\n   tasks\
    \ such as normalization do not typically need to be performed by\n   nodes that\
    \ just pass NAIs around or receive them from the network.\n   End systems MUST\
    \ also perform checking for prohibited output and\n   unassigned code points.\
    \  Other systems MAY perform such checks, when\n   they know that a particular\
    \ data item is an NAI.\n   The realm name is an \"IDN-unaware domain name slot\"\
    \ as defined in\n   [RFC3490].  That is, it can contain only ASCII characters.\
    \  An\n   implementation MAY support Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)\n \
    \  using the ToASCII operation; see [RFC3490] for more information.\n   The responsibility\
    \ for the conversion of internationalized domain\n   names to ASCII is left for\
    \ the end systems, such as network access\n   clients and AAA servers.  Similarly,\
    \ we expect domain name\n   comparisons, matching, resolution, and AAA routing\
    \ to be performed on\n   the ASCII versions of the internationalized domain names.\
    \  This\n   provides a canonical representation, ensures that intermediate\n \
    \  systems such as AAA proxies do not need to perform translations, and\n   can\
    \ be expected to work through systems that are unaware of\n   international character\
    \ sets.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.5.  Compatibility with E-Mail Usernames\n   As proposed in this document, the\
    \ Network Access Identifier is of the\n   form user@realm.  Please note that while\
    \ the user portion of the NAI\n   is based on the BNF described in [RFC0821],\
    \ it has been extended for\n   internationalization support as well as for purposes\
    \ of Section 2.7,\n   and is not necessarily compatible with the usernames used\

    \ and\n   e-mail addresses are different, since the former need to be typed in\n\

- title: 2.6.  Compatibility with DNS
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Compatibility with DNS\n   The BNF of the realm portion allows the realm\

    \   by the BNF described in [RFC1035], Fully Qualified Domain Names\n   (FQDNs)\
    \ such as 3com.com are commonly used and accepted by current\n   software.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Realm Construction
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Realm Construction\n   NAIs are used, among other purposes, for routing\
    \ AAA transactions to\n   the user's home realm.  Usually, the home realm appears\
    \ in the realm\n   portion of the NAI, but in some cases a different realm can\
    \ be used.\n   This may be useful, for instance, when the home realm is reachable\n\
    \   only via another mediating realm.\n   Such usage may prevent interoperability\
    \ unless the parties involved\n   have a mutual agreement that the usage is allowed.\
    \  In particular,\n   NAIs MUST NOT use a different realm than the home realm\
    \ unless the\n   sender has explicit knowledge that (a) the specified other realm\
    \ is\n   available and (b) the other realm supports such usage.  The sender\n\
    \   may determine the fulfillment of these conditions through a database,\n  \
    \ dynamic discovery, or other means not specified here.  Note that the\n   first\
    \ condition is affected by roaming, as the availability of the\n   other realm\
    \ may depend on the user's location or the desired\n   application.\n   The use\

    \ as defined in the ABNF in Section 2.1.  This realm name is an\n   \"IDN-unaware\
    \ domain name slot\", just like the realm name after the\n   \"@\" character;\
    \ see Section 2.4 for details.  When receiving such an\n   NAI, the other realm\
    \ MUST convert the format back to\n   \"user@homerealm.example.net\" when passing\
    \ the NAI forward, as well as\n   applying appropriate AAA routing for the transaction.\n\
    \   The conversion process may apply also recursively.  That is, after\n   the\
    \ conversion, the result may still have one or more '!' characters\n   in the\
    \ username.  For instance, the NAI\n       other2.example.net!home.example.net!user@other1.example.net\n\
    \   would first be converted in other1.example.net to\n       home.example.net!user@other2.example.net\n\
    \   and then at other2.example.net finally to\n       user@homerealm.example.net\n\
    \   Note that the syntax described in this section is optional and is not\n  \
    \ a part of the ABNF.  The '!' character may appear in the username\n   portion\
    \ of an NAI for other purposes as well, and in those cases, the\n   rules outlined\
    \ here do not apply; the interpretation of the username\n   is up to an agreement\
    \ between the identified user and the realm given\n   after the '@' character.\n"

- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Since an NAI reveals the home affiliation of\
    \ a user, it may assist an\n   attacker in further probing the username space.\
    \  Typically, this\n   problem is of most concern in protocols that transmit the\
    \ username in\n   clear-text across the Internet, such as in RADIUS, described\
    \ in\n   [RFC2865] and [RFC2866].  In order to prevent snooping of the\n   username,\
    \ protocols may use confidentiality services provided by\n   protocols transporting\
    \ them, such as RADIUS protected by IPsec\n   [RFC3579] or Diameter protected\
    \ by TLS [RFC3588].\n   This specification adds the possibility of hiding the\
    \ username part\n   in the NAI, by omitting it.  As discussed in Section 2.3,\
    \ this is\n   possible only when NAIs are used together with a separate\n   authentication\
    \ method that can transfer the username in a secure\n   manner.  In some cases,\
    \ application-specific privacy mechanism have\n   also been used with NAIs.  For\
    \ instance, some Extensible\n   Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods apply method-specific\n\
    \   pseudonyms in the username part of the NAI [RFC3748].  While neither\n   of\
    \ these approaches can protect the realm part, their advantage over\n   transport\
    \ protection is that privacy of the username is protected,\n   even through intermediate\
    \ nodes such as NASes.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   In order to avoid creating any new administrative\
    \ procedures,\n   administration of the NAI realm namespace piggybacks on the\n\
    \   administration of the DNS namespace.\n   NAI realm names are required to be\
    \ unique, and the rights to use a\n   given NAI realm for roaming purposes are\
    \ obtained coincident with\n   acquiring the rights to use a particular Fully\
    \ Qualified Domain Name\n   (FQDN).  Those wishing to use an NAI realm name should\
    \ first acquire\n   the rights to use the corresponding FQDN.  Using an NAI realm\
    \ without\n   ownership of the corresponding FQDN creates the possibility of\n\
    \   conflict and therefore is to be discouraged.\n   Note that the use of an FQDN\
    \ as the realm name does not require use\n   of the DNS for location of the authentication\
    \ server.  While Diameter\n   [RFC3588] supports the use of DNS for location of\
    \ authentication\n   servers, existing RADIUS implementations typically use proxy\n\
    \   configuration files in order to locate authentication servers within\n   a\
    \ domain and perform authentication routing.  The implementations\n   described\
    \ in [RFC2194] did not use DNS for location of the\n   authentication server within\
    \ a domain.  Similarly, existing\n   implementations have not found a need for\
    \ dynamic routing protocols\n   or propagation of global routing information.\
    \  Note also that there\n   is no requirement that the NAI represent a valid email\
    \ address.\n"

  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 2486\n   This document contains the following updates\
    \ with respect to the\n   original NAI definition in RFC 2486 [RFC2486]:\n   o\
    \  International character set support has been added for both\n      usernames\
    \ and realms.  Note that this implies character codes 128\n      - 255 may be\
    \ used in the username portion, which may be\n      unacceptable to nodes that\
    \ only support RFC 2486.  Many devices\n      already allow this behaviour, however.\n\
    \   o  Username privacy support has been added.  Note that NAIs without a\n  \
    \    username (for privacy) may not be acceptable to RFC 2486-compliant\n    \
    \  nodes.  Many devices already allow this behaviour, however.\n   o  A recommendation\
    \ to support NAI length of at least 253 octets has\n      been added, and compatibility\
    \ considerations among NAI lengths in\n      this specification and various AAA\
    \ protocols are discussed.  Note\n      that long NAIs may not be acceptable to\
    \ RFC 2486-compliant nodes.\n   o  The mediating network syntax and its implications\
    \ have been fully\n      described and not given only as an example.  Note that\
    \ this syntax\n      is not intended to be a full solution to network discovery\
    \ and\n      selection needs as defined in [netsel-problem].  Rather, it is\n\
    \      intended as a clarification of RFC 2486.\n      However, as discussed in\
    \ Section 2.7, this specification requires\n      that this syntax be applied\
    \ only when there is explicit knowledge\n      that the peer system supports such\
    \ syntax.\n   o  The realm BNF entry definition has been changed to avoid an error\n\
    \      (infinite recursion) in the original specification.\n   o  Several clarifications\
    \ and improvements have been incorporated\n      into the ABNF specification for\
    \ NAIs.\n"
