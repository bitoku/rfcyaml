- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a framework for conveying IPv6\n\
    \   configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network.  But\n   [RFC3315]\
    \ is not specific about how to deal with messages with\n   unrecognized types.\
    \  This document describes the problems associated\n   with receiving DHCPv6 messages\
    \ with unknown types, and defines the\n   behavior of a DHCPv6 server, client,\
    \ or relay agent when handling\n   unknown DHCPv6 messages.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Statement\n   When a relay agent receives a message, it sends the\
    \ message toward\n   either the server or the client.  The relay agent decides\
    \ on the\n   direction to forward based on the message type.  Since RFC 3315 was\n\
    \   published, new message types have been defined.  Additional message\n   types\
    \ may be defined in the future.  RFC 3315 does not specify what\n   to do when\
    \ a DHCP agent does not recognize the type of message it has\n   received.  This\
    \ may lead to relay agents inappropriately dropping\n   these messages and to\
    \ other DHCP agents inappropriately processing\n   these messages.\n   In addition,\
    \ there is no specific requirement for dealing with\n   unknown messages by the\
    \ client or server in RFC 3315.\n   Note that it is expected that most future\
    \ DHCPv6 messages will not be\n   used to communicate directly with relay agents\
    \ (though they may need\n   to be relayed by relay agents).\n"
- title: 4.  Relay Agent Behavior Update
  contents:
  - "4.  Relay Agent Behavior Update\n   Relay agents relay messages toward servers\
    \ and clients according to\n   the message type.  The Relay-reply message is sent\
    \ toward the client.\n   The Relay-forward message and other types of messages\
    \ are sent toward\n   the server.\n   We say \"toward the client\" and \"toward\
    \ the server\" because relay\n   agents may be chained together, so a relay message\
    \ may be sent\n   through multiple relay agents along the path to its destination.\n\
    \   Relay-reply messages specify a destination address; the relay agent\n   extracts\
    \ the encapsulated message and sends it to the specified\n   destination address.\
    \  Any message other than a Relay-reply does not\n   have such a specified destination,\
    \ so it follows the default\n   forwarding path configured on the relay agent,\
    \ which is always toward\n   the server.\n   The sole purpose of requiring relay\
    \ agents to relay unknown messages\n   is to ensure that when legitimate new messages\
    \ are defined in the\n   protocol, relay agents (even if they were manufactured\
    \ prior to the\n   definition of these new messages) will, by default, succeed\
    \ in\n   relaying such messages.\n"
- title: 4.1.  A Valid Message for Constructing a New Relay-forward Message
  contents:
  - "4.1.  A Valid Message for Constructing a New Relay-forward Message\n   Section\
    \ 20.1 of [RFC3315] states that:\n      When a relay agent receives a valid message\
    \ to be relayed, it\n      constructs a new Relay-forward message.\n   It does\
    \ not define which types of messages are valid for constructing\n   Relay-forward\
    \ messages.  In this document, we specify the definition\n   as follows.\n   \
    \   The message is valid for constructing a new Relay-forward message:\n     \
    \ (a)  if the message is a Relay-forward message, or\n      (b)  if the relay\
    \ agent recognizes the message type and is not the\n           intended target,\
    \ or\n      (c)  if the relay agent does not recognize the message type.\n   New\
    \ DHCP message types may be defined in the future that are sent,\n   unsolicited,\
    \ to relay agents.  Relay agents that do not implement\n   these messages will\
    \ not recognize the messages as being intended for\n   them.  Therefore, a relay\
    \ agent that implements this specification\n   will forward such messages to the\
    \ DHCP servers to which it is\n   configured to relay client messages.\n   At\
    \ this time, no such message types have been specified.  If such a\n   message\
    \ is specified in the future, it is possible that this would\n   result in needless\
    \ load on DHCP servers.  If such a message type is\n   defined in a future specification,\
    \ authors may need to consider a\n   strategy for identifying non-conforming relays\
    \ and not sending such\n   messages to those relay agents.\n   However, since\
    \ DHCP servers do not respond to unknown messages, this\n   is unlikely to create\
    \ significant load and is therefore likely to be\n   unnecessary.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Relaying a Message toward the Server
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Relaying a Message toward the Server\n   If the relay agent receives a\
    \ Relay-forward message, Section 20.1.2\n   of [RFC3315] defines the required\
    \ behavior.  If the relay agent\n   receives messages other than Relay-forward\
    \ and Relay-reply and the\n   relay agent does not recognize its message type,\
    \ it MUST forward them\n   as described in Section 20.1.1 of [RFC3315].\n"
- title: 4.3.  Relaying a Message toward the Client
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Relaying a Message toward the Client\n   If the relay agent receives a\
    \ Relay-reply message, it MUST process\n   the message as defined in Section 20.2\
    \ of [RFC3315], regardless of\n   the type of message encapsulated in the Relay\
    \ Message option.\n"
- title: 5.  Client and Server Behavior Update
  contents:
  - "5.  Client and Server Behavior Update\n   A client or server MUST silently discard\
    \ any received DHCPv6 message\n   with an unknown message type.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document creates no new security issues\
    \ that are not already\n   present in RFC 3315.  By explicitly documenting the\
    \ correct handling\n   of unknown messages, this document, if implemented, reduces\
    \ any\n   security exposure that might result from incorrect handling of\n   unknown\
    \ messages.  The following issues are already present with\n   Section 23 of [RFC3315],\
    \ but we discuss them in detail here as\n   guidance for implementors.\n   As\
    \ the relay agent will forward all unknown types of DHCPv6 messages,\n   a malicious\
    \ attacker can interfere with the relaying function by\n   constructing fake DHCPv6\
    \ messages with an arbitrary type code.  The\n   same problem may occur in current\
    \ DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 practice, where\n   the attacker constructs the fake DHCP\
    \ message with a known type code.\n   Clients and servers that implement this\
    \ specification will discard\n   unknown DHCPv6 messages.  Since RFC 3315 did\
    \ not specify relay agent,\n   client, or server behavior in the presence of unknown\
    \ messages, it is\n   possible that some servers or clients that have not been\
    \ updated to\n   conform to this specification will become vulnerable to attacks\n\
    \   through the relay agent as a result of this change.\n   For this reason, we\
    \ recommend that relay agents, clients, and servers\n   be updated to follow this\
    \ new specification.  However, in most\n   deployment scenarios, it will be much\
    \ easier to attack clients\n   directly than through a relay agent.  Furthermore,\
    \ attacks using\n   unknown message types are already possible on the local wire.\n\
    \   So, in most cases, if clients are not upgraded, there should be\n   minimal\
    \ additional risk.  At sites where only servers and relay\n   agents can be upgraded,\
    \ the incremental benefit of doing so most\n   likely exceeds any risk of vulnerable\
    \ clients.\n   Nothing in this update should be construed to mean that relay agents\n\
    \   may not be administratively configurable to drop messages based on\n   the\
    \ message type, for security reasons (e.g., in a firewall).\n"
