  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a metric to quantify an IP network's ability
    to\n   transfer packets in both directions from one host to another host.\n   Two-way
    communication is almost always needed; thus, failure to\n   transfer a packet
    in either direction constitutes a round-trip packet\n   loss.\n   This memo defines
    a metric for round-trip packet loss on Internet\n   paths.  It builds on the notions
    and conventions introduced in the IP\n   Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework
    [RFC2330].  Also, the\n   specifications of the one-way packet loss metric for
    IPPM [RFC2680]\n   and the round-trip delay metric for IPPM [RFC2681] are frequently\n
    \  referenced and modified to match the round-trip circumstances\n   addressed
    here.  However, this memo assumes that the reader is\n   familiar with the references;
    thus, it does not repeat material as\n   was done in [RFC2681].\n   This memo
    uses the terms \"two-way\" and \"round-trip\" synonymously.\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Motivation\n   Many user applications and the transport protocols that
      make them\n   possible require two-way communications.  For example, the TCP
      SYN->,\n   <-SYN-ACK, ACK-> three-way handshake attempted billions of times
      each\n   day cannot be completed without two-way connectivity in a near-\n   simultaneous
      time interval.  Thus, measurements of Internet round-\n   trip packet loss performance
      provide a basis to infer application\n   performance more easily.\n   Measurement
      system designers have also recognized advantages of\n   system simplicity when
      one host simply echoes or reflects test\n   packets to the sender.  Round-trip
      packet loss measurements are\n   frequently conducted and reported in practice.
      \ The ubiquitous \"ping\"\n   tools allow the measurement of round-trip packet
      loss and delay but\n   usually require ICMP Echo-Request/Reply support, and
      ICMP packets may\n   encounter exceptional treatment on the measurement path
      (see\n   Section 2.6 of [RFC2681]).  The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol\n
      \  (TWAMP) specified in [RFC5357] establishes a round-trip packet loss\n   measurement
      capability for the Internet.  However, there is currently\n   no round-trip
      packet loss metric specified according to the [RFC2330]\n   framework.\n   [RFC2681]
      indicates that round-trip measurements may sometimes\n   encounter \"asymmetric\"
      paths.  When loss is observed using a round-\n   trip measurement, there is
      often a desire to ascertain which of the\n   two directional paths \"lost\"
      the packet.  Under some circumstances,\n   it is possible to make this inference.
      \ The round-trip measurement\n   method raises a few complications when interpreting
      the embedded one-\n   way results, and the user should be aware of them.\n   [RFC2681]
      also points out that loss measurement conducted\n   sequentially in both directions
      of a path and reported as a round-\n   trip result may be exactly the desired
      metric.  On the other hand, it\n   may be difficult to derive the state of round-trip
      packet loss from\n   one-way measurements conducted in each direction unless
      a method to\n   match the appropriate one-way measurements has been pre-arranged.\n
      \  Finally, many measurement systems report statistics on a conditional\n   delay
      distribution, where the condition is packet arrival at the\n   destination.
      \ This condition is encouraged in [RFC3393], [RFC5481],\n   and [RFC6703].  As
      a result, lost packets need to be reported\n   separately, according to a standardized
      metric.  This memo defines\n   such a metric.\n   See Section 1.1 of [RFC2680]
      for additional motivation of the packet\n   loss metric.\n"

      \  o  Src sent the first bit of a Type-P packet to Dst at wire-time\n      TstampSrc,\n

      \ the Dst did not send a Type-P packet back to the Src, or\n   o  the Src did
      not receive a reflected Type-P packet sent from\n      the Dst.\n   Following

    for results collected using a\n   round-trip measurement architecture, such as
    in TWAMP [RFC5357].\n   The sampling process for the reverse path (Dst->Src) is
    a conditional\n   process that depends on successful packet arrival at the Dst
    and\n   correct operation at the Dst to generate the reflected packet.\n   Therefore,
    the sampling process for the reverse path will be\n   significantly affected when
    appreciable loss occurs on the Src->Dst\n   path, making an attempt to assess
    the reverse path performance\n   invalid (for loss or possibly any metric).\n
    \  Further, the sampling times for the reverse path (Dst->Src) are a\n   random
    process that depends on the original sample times (TstampSrc),\n   the one-way
    delay for successful packet arrival at the Dst, and time\n   taken at the Dst
    to generate the reflected packet.  Therefore, the\n   sampling process for the
    reverse path will be significantly affected\n   when appreciable delay variation
    occurs on the Src->Dst path, making\n   an attempt to assess the reverse path
    performance invalid (for loss\n   or possibly any metric).\n   As discussed above
    in Section 5.4, packet reordering is always a\n   possibility.  In addition to
    the severe delay variation that usually\n   accompanies it, reordering on the
    Src->Dst path will cause a\n   misalignment of sequence numbers applied at the
    Dst when compared to\n   the sender numbers.  Measurement implementations MUST
    address this\n   possible outcome.\n"

  - "8.  Measurement Considerations and Calibration\n   Prior to conducting this measurement,
    the participating hosts MUST be\n   configured to send and receive test packets
    of the chosen Type-P.\n   Standard measurement protocols are capable of this task
    [RFC5357],\n   but any reliable method is sufficient (e.g., if the issues with
    ICMP\n   discussed in Section 2.6 of [RFC2681] can be alleviated, and the\n   requirements
    of Sections 4.3 and 4.4 above are met, then ICMP could\n   be used).\n   Two key
    features of the host that receives test packets and returns\n   them to the originating
    host are described in Section 4.2 of\n   [RFC5357].  Every received test packet
    MUST result in a responding\n   packet, and the response MUST be generated as
    quickly as possible.\n   This implies that interface buffers will be serviced
    promptly and\n   that buffer discards will be extremely rare.  These features
    of the\n   measurement equipment MUST be calibrated according to Section 3.7.3\n
    \  of [RFC2679] when operating under a representative measurement load\n   (as
    defined by the user).  Both unexpected test packet discards, and\n   the systematic
    and random errors and uncertainties, MUST be recorded.\n   We note that Section
    4.2.1 of [RFC5357] specifies a method to collect\n   all four significant timestamps
    needed to describe a packet's round-\n   trip delay [RFC2681] and remove the processing
    time incurred at the\n   responding host.  This information supports the measurement
    of the\n   corresponding one-way delays encountered on the round-trip path,\n
    \  which can identify path asymmetry or unexpected processing time at\n   the
    responding host.\n"

    - "9.1.  Denial-of-Service Attacks\n   This metric requires a stream of packets
      sent from one host (source)\n   to another host (destination) through intervening
      networks, and back.\n   This method could be abused for denial-of-service attacks
      directed at\n   the destination and/or the intervening network(s).\n   Administrators
      of source, destination, and intervening network(s)\n   should establish bilateral
      or multilateral agreements regarding the\n   timing, size, and frequency of
      collection of sample metrics.  Use of\n   this method in excess of the terms
      agreed upon by the participants\n   may be cause for immediate rejection or
      discard of packets, or other\n   escalation procedures as defined between the
      affected parties.\n"

    - "9.2.  User Data Confidentiality\n   Active use of this method generates packets
      for a sample, rather than\n   taking samples based on user data, and does not
      threaten user data\n   confidentiality.  Passive measurement must restrict attention
      to the\n   headers of interest.  Since user payloads may be temporarily stored\n
      \  for length analysis, suitable precautions MUST be taken to keep this\n   information
      safe and confidential.  In most cases, a hashing function\n   will produce a
      value suitable for payload comparisons.\n"

    - "9.3.  Interference with the Metrics\n   It may be possible to identify that
      a certain packet or stream of\n   packets is part of a sample.  With that knowledge
      at the destination\n   and/or the intervening networks, it is possible to change
      the\n   processing of the packets (e.g., increasing or decreasing delay) in
      a\n   way that may distort the measured performance.  It may also be\n   possible
      to generate additional packets that appear to be part of the\n   sample metric.
      \ These additional packets are likely to perturb the\n   results of the sample
      measurement.\n   Authentication or encryption techniques, such as digital signatures,\n
      \  MAY be used where appropriate to guard against injected traffic\n   attacks.
      \ [RFC5357] includes both authentication and encryption\n   features.\n"

  - "10.  IANA Considerations\n   Metrics previously defined in the IETF were registered
    in the IANA\n   IPPM Metrics Registry; however, this process was discontinued
    when\n   the registry structure was found to be inadequate, and the registry\n
    \  was declared obsolete [RFC6248].\n   Although the metrics in this document
    may be considered for some form\n   of registration in the future, no IANA action
    is requested at this\n   time.\n"
