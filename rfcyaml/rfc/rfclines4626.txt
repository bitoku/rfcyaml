The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Short Overview of Fibre Channel 3.1.
The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point to point serial data channel, structured for high performance.
Fibre Channel provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols, such as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High  Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.
Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple communication points, called N Ports, interconnected either by a switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point to point link.
A Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N Ports.
A Fabric may consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are switches.
An N Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch called an F Port.
When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port is called an FL Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL Ports.
Nx Port is used to refer to either an N Port or an NL Port.
Fx Port is used to refer to either an F Port or an FL Port.
A switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an Inter Switch Link (ISL), is called an E Port.
A B Port connects a bridge device with an E Port on a switch; a B Port provides a subset of E Port functionality.
Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and most ports, have globally unique names.
These globally unique names are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).
More information on WWNs can be found in [FC FS].
WWNs are expected to be persistent across agent and unit resets.
Fibre Channel frames contain 24 bit address identifiers that identify the frame's source and destination ports.
Each FC port has both an address identifier and a WWN.
When a fabric is in use, the FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.
Each octet of a 24 bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy, a Domain ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.
The routing of frames within the Fabric is normally based on a routing protocol called Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF).
FSPF is a link state path selection protocol, which is defined in Section 8 of [FC SW 4].
FSPF keeps track of the state of the links on all switches in the Fabric and associates a cost with each link.
The protocol computes paths from a switch to all the other switches in the Fabric by adding the cost of all the links traversed by the path, and choosing the path that minimizes the cost.
The collection of link states (including cost) of all the switches in a Fabric constitutes the topology database (or link state database).
FSPF Protocol FSPF has four major components: a) A Hello protocol, used to establish connectivity with a neighbor switch, to establish the identity of the neighbor switch, and to exchange FSPF parameters and capabilities; b)
A replicated topology database, with protocols and mechanisms to keep the databases synchronized across the Fabric; c)
A path computation algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm); d)
The topology database synchronization in turn consists of two major components: an initial database synchronization and an update mechanism.
The initial database synchronization is used when a switch is initialized, or when an Inter Switch Link (ISL) comes up.
The update mechanism is used in two circumstances:
When there is a link state change; for example, an ISL going down or coming up; b) On a periodic basis, to prevent switches from deleting topology information from the database.
Also note that all connections between Fibre Channel switches are point to point.
The latest standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing multiple Fabric Switch elements is [FC SW 4].
[FC SW 4] carries forward the previous version's specification for the operation of a single Fabric in a physical infrastructure, augmenting it with the definition of Virtual Fabrics and with the specification of how multiple Virtual Fabrics can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.
The use of Virtual Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in its header to indicate which one of several Virtual Fabrics that frame is being transmitted on.
All frames entering a particular "Core Switch" [FC SW 4]
(i.e., a physical switch) on the same Virtual Fabric are processed by the same "Virtual Switch" within that Core switch.
The first standardized MIB module for Fibre Channel [
RFC4044] was focussed on Fibre Channel switches.
It is being replaced by the more generic Fibre Channel Management MIB [FC MGMT]
which defines basic information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including extensions to the standard IF MIB [RFC2863] for Fibre Channel interfaces.
This MIB module extends beyond [FC MGMT] to cover the operation of the FSPF routing protocol in Fibre Channel switches.
This MIB module only contains information specific to FSPF.
Information that would still be applicable if any other routing protocol were used is specified in a separate MIB module.
This MIB module imports some common Textual Conventions from T11 TC  MIB, defined in [RFC4439].
This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of, and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of the FSPF protocol.
Fibre Channel Management Instance A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [FC MGMT] as a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.
Fibre Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management instances in whatever way is most convenient for the implementation(s).
For example, one such grouping accommodates a single SNMP agent with multiple AgentX
[RFC2741] sub agents, with each sub agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance.
The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC MGMT MIB [FC MGMT]
as the index value that uniquely identifies each Fibre Channel management instance within the same SNMP context ([RFC3411], Section 3.3.1).
The FC MGMT MIB [FC MGMT] defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed by Fibre Channel management instances.
Each Fibre Channel management instance can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.
The Switch Index, fcmSwitchIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC MGMT MIB as the index value that uniquely identifies a Fibre Channel switch among those (one or more) managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.
Whether operating on a physical Fabric (i.e., without Virtual Fabrics) or within a Virtual Fabric, the operation of FSPF within a Fabric is identical.
Therefore, this MIB module defines all Fabric  related information in tables that are INDEX ed by an arbitrary integer, named a "Fabric Index", the syntax of which is IMPORTed from the T11 TC MIB.
When a device is connected to a single physical Fabric, without use of any virtual Fabrics, the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.
In an environment of multiple virtual and/or physical Fabrics, this index provides a means to distinguish one Fabric from another.
It is quite possible, and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel switch will have ports connected to multiple virtual and/or physical Fabrics.
Thus, in order to simplify a management protocol query concerning all the Fabrics to which a single switch is connected, fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before t11FspfFabricIndex when they both appear in the same INDEX clause.
This section describes the four MIB groups contained in the MIB module.
This group provides for per Fabric monitoring of the FSPF state and per Fabric monitoring/configuration of FSPF parameters.
This group provides for per interface monitoring of FSPF state/statistics and per interface monitoring/configuration of FSPF parameters.
This group permits the monitoring of the information present in the FSPF topology database.
This group contains the notifications that are generated on asynchronous events related to the operation of FSPF.

This table allows the users to configure and monitor the FSPF parameters that are per interface (identified by a t11FspfIfIndex value), per Fabric (identified by a t11FspfFabricIndex value), and per switch (identified by values of fcmInstanceIndex and fcmSwitchIndex).
Creating a row in this table via t11FspfIfRowStatus provides the means to specify non default parameter value(s) for an interface at a time when the relevant row in this table would not otherwise exist because the interface is either down
or it is not an E Port, but the corresponding row in the t11FspfTable must already exist.
After the non default values have been specified for a port's parameters, they need to be retained in this table, even when the port becomes 'isolated'.
However, having unnecessary rows in this table clutters it up and makes those rows that are useful harder for an NMS to find.
Therefore, when an E Port becomes isolated, its row gets deleted if and only if all of its parameter values are the default values; also, when an E Port becomes non isolated in a particular Fabric, a row in this table needs to exist and is automatically created, if necessary.
The specific conditions for an automated/implicit deletion of a row are: a) if the corresponding interface is no longer an E Port (e.g., a G Port which is dynamically determined to be an F Port), and all configurable parameters have default values; or b) if the interface identified by t11FspfIfIndex no longer exists (e.g., because a line card is physically removed); or
c) if the corresponding row in the t11FspfTable is deleted. "

There are several management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
