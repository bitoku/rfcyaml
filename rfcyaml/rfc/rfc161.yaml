  - "              A SOLUTION TO THE RACE CONDITION IN THE ICP\n   In NWG/RFC #143\
    \ a race condition in the ICP was described and a\n   solution was suggested.\
    \  The problem arises because the Host-Host\n   protocol does not specify what\
    \ the NCP should do when it gets more\n   than one request of STR (or RTS) to\
    \ the same socket.  As a result\n   this decision depends on the particular implementation:\
    \ some may\n   queue these requests (SDC for example), some will refuse a request\
    \ if\n   the socket is already connected (UCLA for example), etc.\n   The solution\
    \ is not to change the Host-Host protocol, but find a\n   third level ICP which\
    \ does not depend on this issue.  Such a solution\n   is the following: the INITs\
    \ from server to user and user to server\n   ((S5), (S6), (U5), (U6) on page 3\
    \ in RFC #143) should use another\n   socket -- say U+2 and U+3.  The sequences\
    \ in RFC #143 would be:\n      Server                             User\n     \
    \ (S1) LISTEN(L,32)                  (U1) INIT(U,L,32)\n      (S2) [wait for match]\
    \              (U2)\n      (S3) SEND(L,S)                     (U3) RECEIVE(U,S)\n\
    \      (S4) CLOSE(L)                      (U4) CLOSE(U)\n      (S5) INIT(S,U+3,Bu)\
    \                (U5) INIT(U+3,S,Bu)\n      (S6) INIT(S+1,U+2,Bs)            \
    \  (U6) INIT(U+2,S+1,Bs)\n"
