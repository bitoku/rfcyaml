  - "                         MIX and MIXAL at UCSB\nThe following, in response to\
    \ David Walden's MIX query (RFC#473) was\nwritten by a graduate student at UCSB.\
    \  Questions regarding \"cheap\"\nusage should be directed to Roland F. Bryan\
    \ (RFB) at UCSB.\nMark Scott Johnson\n18 March 1973\n    I wrote a MIXAL assembler\
    \ and a MIX simulator last summer.  The\nassembler is written in SNOBOL4 and,\
    \ unfortunately, is fairly expensive\nto run.  The assembler has been fairly well\
    \ debugged and is documented.\nHowever, although the MIX simulator is written\
    \ (in 360 Assembler), it\nhas only been partially debugged.  Due to the resumption\
    \ of school and\nother commitments, I was unable to give the simulator a thorough\n\
    debugging.  All the simulated instructions except I/O instructions have\nbeen\
    \ tested somewhat and appear to be operating well.  Also, card reader\ninput and\
    \ printer output are operational, but my simulation of disk\nfiles and magnetic\
    \ tape has not been completed.  There is presently no\ndocumentation for the simulator.\
    \  Very little documentation is needed,\nhowever, since the simulator follows\
    \ almost to the letter the\nspecifications detailed in _Fundamental_Algorithms_.\n\
    \    If anyone is interested in using the assembler and/or the simulator,\nI will\
    \ be happy to supply what documentation exists plus some\ninformation on how the\
    \ programs can be accessed.  Also, if anyone is\ninterested in the source code\
    \ for the programs, I will be happy to send\nit.  I hope to be able to finish\
    \ the simulator this next quarter.  If\nanyone wants to use the system and if\
    \ they should find any bugs, I will\ndo my best to maintain and correct the programs.\n\
