- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   All self-governing bodies have ways of managing the scope\
    \ of\n   participant interaction.  For example, deliberative assemblies often\n\
    \   employ \"rules of order\" for determining who gets to speak, when, and\n \
    \  for how long.  Similarly, there is widespread agreement in so-called\n   \"\
    liberal\" societies that the right to free speech is not absolute,\n   e.g., political\
    \ speech is given more leeway than commercial speech,\n   and some forms of speech\
    \ (e.g., egregious libel or incitement to\n   violence) are considered unacceptable.\n\
    \   The IETF uses a consensus-driven process for developing computer-\n   communications\
    \ standards in an open fashion.  An important part of\n   this consensus-driven\
    \ process is the pervasive use of mailing lists\n   for discussion.  Unlike many\
    \ other organizations, anyone may post\n   messages on those IETF mailing lists,\
    \ and in doing so, participate in\n   the IETF process.  Historically, this approach\
    \ has worked very well\n   in the IETF, as it fosters participation from a wide\
    \ range of\n   stakeholders.  (For the purposes of this memo, the term \"IETF\
    \ mailing\n   list\" refers to any mailing list functioning under IETF auspices,\n\
    \   such as the IETF general discussion list, or a working group or\n   design\
    \ team mailing list.)\n   Notably, in a small number of cases, a participant has\
    \ engaged in\n   what amounts to a \"denial-of-service\" attack to disrupt the\n\
    \   consensus-driven process.  Typically, these attacks are made by\n   repeatedly\
    \ posting messages that are off-topic, inflammatory, or\n   otherwise counter-productive.\
    \  In contrast, good faith disagreement\n   is a healthy part of the consensus-driven\
    \ process.\n   For example, if a working group is unable to reach consensus, this\
    \ is\n   an acceptable, albeit unfortunate, outcome; however, if that working\n\
    \   group fails to achieve consensus because it is being continuously\n   disrupted,\
    \ then the disruption constitutes an abuse of the\n   consensus-driven process.\
    \  Interactions of this type are\n   fundamentally different from \"the lone voice\
    \ of dissent\" in which a\n   participant expresses a view that is discussed but\
    \ does not achieve\n   consensus.  In other words, individual bad faith should\
    \ not trump\n   community goodwill.\n   Guidelines have been developed for dealing\
    \ with abusive behavior\n   (c.f., Section 3.2 of [1] and [2]).  Although not\
    \ exhaustive,\n   examples of abusive or otherwise inappropriate postings to IETF\n\
    \   mailing lists include:\n   o  unsolicited bulk e-mail;\n   o  discussion of\
    \ subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings,\n      activities, or technical\
    \ concerns;\n   o  unprofessional commentary, regardless of the general subject;\
    \ and,\n   o  announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are not\n\
    \      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF.\n   In practice,\
    \ the application of those guidelines has included the\n   temporary suspension\
    \ of posting rights to a specific mailing list.\n   If necessary, the length of\
    \ the suspension has been increased with\n   each successive suspension.  In many\
    \ cases, applying those guidelines\n   will produce the desired modification in\
    \ behaviour.  However, when\n   those guidelines fail to provide the desired modification\
    \ in\n   behaviour, more drastic measures should be available to reduce or\n \
    \  eliminate these attacks' impact on the IETF process.\n   This document describes\
    \ one such drastic measure.\n"
- title: 2. A Revocation Practice
  contents:
  - "2. A Revocation Practice\n   Please refer to [3] for the meaning conveyed by\
    \ the uppercase words\n   in this section.\n   As a part of its activities, the\
    \ Internet Engineering Steering Group\n   (IESG) makes decisions about \"actions\"\
    .  Typically, an action refers\n   to the publication of a document on the standards-track,\
    \ the\n   chartering of a working group, and so on.  This memo recommends that\n\
    \   the IESG also undertake a new type of action, termed a PR-action\n   (\"posting\
    \ rights\" action).\n   A PR-action identifies one or more individuals, citing\
    \ messages\n   posted by those individuals to an IETF mailing list, that appear\
    \ to\n   be abusive of the consensus-driven process.  If approved by the IESG,\n\
    \   then:\n   o  those identified on the PR-action have their posting rights to\n\
    \      that IETF mailing list removed; and,\n   o  maintainers of any IETF mailing\
    \ list may, at their discretion,\n      also remove posting rights to that IETF\
    \ mailing list.\n   Once taken, this action remains in force until explicitly\
    \ nullified\n   and SHOULD remain in force for at least one year.\n   One year\
    \ after the PR-action is approved, a new PR-action MAY be\n   introduced which\
    \ restores the posting rights for that individual.\n   The IESG SHOULD consider\
    \ the frequency of nullifying requests when\n   evaluating a new PR-action.  If\
    \ the posting rights are restored the\n   individual is responsible for contacting\
    \ the owners of the mailing\n   lists to have them restored.\n   Regardless of\
    \ whether the PR-action revokes or restores posting\n   rights, the IESG follows\
    \ the same algorithm as with its other\n   actions:\n   1.  it is introduced by\
    \ an IESG Area Director (AD), who, prior to\n       doing so, may choose to inform\
    \ the interested parties;\n   2.  it is published as an IESG last call on the\
    \ IETF general\n       discussion list;\n   3.  it is discussed by the community;\n\
    \   4.  it is discussed by the IESG; and, finally,\n   5.  using the usual consensus-based\
    \ process, it is decided upon by\n       the IESG.\n   Of course, as with all\
    \ IESG actions, the appeals process outlined in\n   [4] may be invoked to contest\
    \ a PR-action approved by the IESG.\n   Working groups SHOULD ensure that their\
    \ associated mailing list is\n   manageable.  For example, some may try to circumvent\
    \ the revocation\n   of their posting rights by changing email addresses; accordingly\
    \ it\n   should be possible to restrict the new email address.\n   Finally, note\
    \ that the scope of a PR-action deals solely with posting\n   rights.  Consistent\
    \ with the final paragraph of Section 3.2 of [1],\n   no action may be taken to\
    \ prevent individuals from receiving messages\n   sent to a mailing list.\n"

- title: Appendix A. Q & A
  contents:
  - "Appendix A. Q & A\n   Q: Isn't a year too long?\n   A: No.\n      An initial\
    \ PR-action is not undertaken lightly.  It is approved\n      only after a period\
    \ of substantive consideration and community\n      review.  If a PR-action is\
    \ approved, then this indicates that a\n      serious situation has arisen.\n\
    \   Q: Why not require one PR-action per IETF mailing list?\n   A: To do so would\
    \ enable a prolonged series of denial-of-service\n      attacks.\n      If someone\
    \ is poorly-behaved on one IETF mailing list, but well-\n      behaved on another,\
    \ then the maintainer for the second IETF\n      mailing list needn't revoke posting\
    \ rights.  However, the more\n      likely scenario is that someone who behaves\
    \ poorly on one IETF\n      mailing list is unwilling to be well-behaved on any\
    \ IETF mailing\n      list.\n   Q: Should the initiation of a PR-action come from\
    \ outside the IESG?\n   A: Informally, sure; formally, no.\n      Under the IETF's\
    \ consensus-driven process, IESG actions are always\n      formally initiated\
    \ by an IESG Area Director (AD).  In practice,\n      the motivation for an IESG\
    \ member to initiate an action almost\n      always comes from outside the IESG.\
    \  For example, when a working\n      group (WG) reaches consensus on a document,\
    \ the WG chair informs\n      the relevant AD that the document is ready for the\
    \ AD to consider\n      it for a document action.  In the case of this document\
    \ -- an IETF\n      individual submission -- the author will iteratively circulate\
    \ the\n      document for wide discussion and make revisions.  At some point,\n\
    \      the author will contact an AD and ask for a document action to\n      publish\
    \ this document as a Best Current Practice (BCP).\n   Q: Is this censorship?\n\
    \   A: Only if you believe in anarchy.\n      What is important is that the rules\
    \ surrounding PR-actions exhibit\n      the same properties used by the rest of\
    \ the consensus-based\n      process.\n   Q: C'mon! You really are a closet fascist.\n\
    \   A: No, I'm a libertarian.\n      Frankly, I would prefer that people behave\
    \ reasonably and act in\n      good faith.  Since my first involvement with the\
    \ IETF (nee GADS,\n      circa 1983), everyone understood that reasonable behavior\
    \ was a\n      good thing.  After 20 years, I regret to inform you that this step\n\
    \      is inevitable.\n"
