  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) protocol element and\
    \ generic\n   syntax is defined by RFC 3986 [5].  Each URI begins with a scheme\n\
    \   name, as defined by Section 3.1 of RFC 3986, that refers to a\n   specification\
    \ for identifiers within that scheme.  The URI syntax\n   provides a federated\
    \ and extensible naming system, where each\n   scheme's specification may further\
    \ restrict the syntax and semantics\n   of identifiers using that scheme.  This\
    \ document provides guidelines\n   for the definition of new URI schemes, for\
    \ consideration by those who\n   are defining, registering, or evaluating those\
    \ definitions, as well\n   as a process and mechanism for registering URI schemes\
    \ within the\n   IANA URI scheme registry.  The registry has two parts: 'provisional'\n\
    \   and 'permanent', with different requirements.  Guidelines and\n   requirements\
    \ for both parts are given.\n   This document obsoletes both RFCs 2717 [7] and\
    \ 2718 [8].  RFCs 2717\n   and 2718 drew a distinction between 'locators' (identifiers\
    \ used for\n   accessing resources available on the Internet) and 'names'\n  \
    \ (identifiers used for naming possibly abstract resources, independent\n   of\
    \ any mechanism for accessing them).  The intent was to use the\n   designation\
    \ \"URL\" (Uniform Resource Locator) for those identifiers\n   that were locators\
    \ and \"URN\" (Uniform Resource Name) for those\n   identifiers that were names.\
    \  In practice, the line between 'locator'\n   and 'name' has been difficult to\
    \ draw: locators can be used as names,\n   and names can be used as locators.\n\
    \   As a result, recent documents have used the term \"URI\" for all\n   resource\
    \ identifiers, avoiding the term \"URL\" and reserving the term\n   \"URN\" explicitly\
    \ for those URIs using the \"urn\" scheme name (RFC 2141\n   [2]).  URN \"namespaces\"\
    \ (RFC 3406 [9]) are specific to the \"urn\"\n   scheme and not covered explicitly\
    \ by this document.\n   RFC 2717 defined a set of registration trees in which\
    \ URI schemes\n   could be registered, one of which was called the IETF Tree,\
    \ to be\n   managed by IANA.  RFC 2717 proposed that additional registration\n\
    \   trees might be approved by the IESG.  However, no such registration\n   trees\
    \ have been approved.\n   This document eliminates RFC 2717's distinction between\
    \ different\n   'trees' for URI schemes; instead there is a single namespace for\n\
    \   registered values.  Within that namespace, there are values that are\n   approved\
    \ as meeting a set of criteria for URI schemes.  Other scheme\n   names may also\
    \ be registered provisionally, without necessarily\n   meeting those criteria.\
    \  The intent of the registry is to:\n   o  provide a central point of discovery\
    \ for established URI scheme\n      names, and easy location of their defining\
    \ documents;\n   o  discourage use of the same URI scheme name for different purposes;\n\
    \   o  help those proposing new URI scheme names to discern established\n    \
    \  trends and conventions, and avoid names that might be confused\n      with\
    \ existing ones;\n   o  encourage registration by setting a low barrier for provisional\n\
    \      registrations.\n   RFC 3987 [6] introduced a new protocol element, the\
    \ Internationalized\n   Resource Identifier (IRI), and defined a mapping between\
    \ URIs and\n   IRIs.  There is no separate registry or registration process for\n\
    \   IRIs.  Those who wish to describe resource identifiers that are\n   useful\
    \ as IRIs should define the corresponding URI syntax, and note\n   that the IRI\
    \ usage follows the rules and transformations defined in\n   RFC 3987.\n   Within\
    \ this document, the key words MUST, MAY, SHOULD, REQUIRED,\n   RECOMMENDED, and\
    \ so forth are used within the general meanings\n   established in RFC 2119 [1],\
    \ within the context that they are\n   requirements on future registration documents.\n"
- title: 2.  Guidelines for Permanent URI Scheme Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Guidelines for Permanent URI Scheme Definitions\n   This section gives considerations\
    \ for new URI schemes.  Meeting these\n   guidelines is REQUIRED for permanent\
    \ URI scheme registration.\n   Meeting these guidelines is also RECOMMENDED for\
    \ provisional\n   registration, as described in Section 3.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Demonstratable, New, Long-Lived Utility
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Demonstratable, New, Long-Lived Utility\n   The use and deployment of new\
    \ URI schemes in the Internet\n   infrastructure is costly; some parts of URI\
    \ processing may be\n   scheme-dependent, and deployed software already processes\
    \ URIs of\n   well-known schemes.  Introducing a new URI scheme may require\n\
    \   additional software, not only for client software and user agents but\n  \
    \ also in additional parts of the network infrastructure (gateways,\n   proxies,\
    \ caches) [11].  URI schemes constitute a single, global\n   namespace; it is\
    \ desirable to avoid contention over use of short,\n   mnemonic scheme names.\
    \  For these reasons, the unbounded registration\n   of new schemes is harmful.\
    \  New URI schemes SHOULD have clear utility\n   to the broad Internet community,\
    \ beyond that available with already\n   registered URI schemes.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Syntactic Compatibility
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Syntactic Compatibility\n   RFC 3986 [5] defines the generic syntax for\
    \ all URI schemes, along\n   with the syntax of common URI components that are\
    \ used by many URI\n   schemes to define hierarchical identifiers.  All URI scheme\n\
    \   specifications MUST define their own syntax such that all strings\n   matching\
    \ their scheme-specific syntax will also match the\n   <absolute-URI> grammar\
    \ described in Section 4.3 of RFC 3986.\n   New URI schemes SHOULD reuse the common\
    \ URI components of RFC 3986\n   for the definition of hierarchical naming schemes.\
    \  However, if there\n   is a strong reason for a URI scheme not to use the hierarchical\n\
    \   syntax, then the new scheme definition SHOULD follow the syntax of\n   previously\
    \ registered schemes.\n   URI schemes that are not intended for use with relative\
    \ URIs SHOULD\n   avoid use of the forward slash \"/\" character, which is used\
    \ for\n   hierarchical delimiters, and the complete path segments \".\" and \"\
    ..\"\n   (dot-segments).\n   Avoid improper use of \"//\".  The use of double\
    \ slashes in the first\n   part of a URI is not an artistic indicator that what\
    \ follows is a\n   URI: Double slashes are used ONLY when the syntax of the URI's\n\
    \   <scheme-specific-part> contains a hierarchical structure as described\n  \
    \ in RFC 3986.  In URIs from such schemes, the use of double slashes\n   indicates\
    \ that what follows is the top hierarchical element for a\n   naming authority.\
    \  (See Section 3.2 of RFC 3986 for more details.)\n   URI schemes that do not\
    \ contain a conformant hierarchical structure\n   in their <scheme-specific-part>\
    \ SHOULD NOT use double slashes\n   following the \"<scheme>:\" string.\n   New\
    \ URI schemes SHOULD clearly define the role of RFC 3986 [5]\n   reserved characters\
    \ in URIs of the scheme being defined.  The syntax\n   of the new scheme should\
    \ be clear about which of the \"reserved\" set\n   of characters (as defined in\
    \ RFC 3986) are used as delimiters within\n   the URIs of the new scheme, and\
    \ when those characters must be\n   escaped, versus when they may be used without\
    \ escaping.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Well-Defined
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Well-Defined\n   While URIs may or may not be useful as locators in practice,\
    \ a URI\n   scheme definition itself MUST be clear as to how it is expected to\n\
    \   function.  Schemes that are not intended to be used as locators\n   SHOULD\
    \ describe how the resource identified can be determined or\n   accessed by software\
    \ that obtains a URI of that scheme.\n   For schemes that function as locators,\
    \ it is important that the\n   mechanism of resource location be clearly defined.\
    \  This might mean\n   different things depending on the nature of the URI scheme.\n\
    \   In many cases, new URI schemes are defined as ways to translate\n   between\
    \ other namespaces or protocols and the general framework of\n   URIs.  For example,\
    \ the \"ftp\" URI scheme translates into the FTP\n   protocol, while the \"mid\"\
    \ URI scheme translates into a Message-ID\n   identifier of an email message.\
    \  For such schemes, the description of\n   the mapping must be complete, and\
    \ in sufficient detail so that the\n   mapping in both directions is clear: how\
    \ to map from a URI into an\n   identifier or set of protocol actions or name\
    \ in the target\n   namespace, and how legal values in the base namespace, or\
    \ legal\n   protocol interactions, might be represented in a valid URI.  In\n\
    \   particular, the mapping should describe the mechanisms for encoding\n   binary\
    \ or character strings within valid character sequences in a URI\n   (See Section\
    \ 2.6 for guidelines).  If not all legal values or\n   protocol interactions of\
    \ the base standard can be represented using\n   the URI scheme, the definition\
    \ should be clear about which subset are\n   allowed, and why.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Definition of Operations
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Definition of Operations\n   As part of the definition of how a URI identifies\
    \ a resource, a URI\n   scheme definition SHOULD define the applicable set of\
    \ operations that\n   may be performed on a resource using the URI as its identifier.\
    \  A\n   model for this is HTTP; an HTTP resource can be operated on by GET,\n\
    \   POST, PUT, and a number of other operations available through the\n   HTTP\
    \ protocol.  The URI scheme definition should describe all\n   well-defined operations\
    \ on the URI identifier, and what they are\n   supposed to do.\n   Some URI schemes\
    \ don't fit into the \"information access\" paradigm of\n   URIs.  For example,\
    \ \"telnet\" provides location information for\n   initiating a bi-directional\
    \ data stream to a remote host; the only\n   operation defined is to initiate\
    \ the connection.  In any case, the\n   operations appropriate for a URI scheme\
    \ should be documented.\n   Note: It is perfectly valid to say that \"no operation\
    \ apart from GET\n   is defined for this URI\".  It is also valid to say that\
    \ \"there's only\n   one operation defined for this URI, and it's not very GET-like\"\
    .  The\n   important point is that what is defined on this scheme is described.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Context of Use
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Context of Use\n   In general, URIs are used within a broad range of protocols\
    \ and\n   applications.  Most commonly, URIs are used as references to\n   resources\
    \ within directories or hypertext documents, as hyperlinks to\n   other resources.\
    \  In some cases, a URI scheme is intended for use\n   within a different, specific\
    \ set of protocols or applications.  If\n   so, the scheme definition SHOULD describe\
    \ the intended use and\n   include references to documentation that define the\
    \ applications\n   and/or protocols cited.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Internationalization and Character Encoding
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Internationalization and Character Encoding\n   When describing URI schemes\
    \ in which (some of) the elements of the\n   URI are actually representations\
    \ of human-readable text, care should\n   be taken not to introduce unnecessary\
    \ variety in the ways in which\n   characters are encoded into octets and then\
    \ into URI characters; see\n   RFC 3987 [6] and Section 2.5 of RFC 3986 [5] for\
    \ guidelines.  If URIs\n   of a scheme contain any text fields, the scheme definition\
    \ MUST\n   describe the ways in which characters are encoded, and any\n   compatibility\
    \ issues with IRIs of the scheme.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Clear Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Clear Security Considerations\n   Definitions of URI schemes MUST be accompanied\
    \ by a clear analysis of\n   the security implications for systems that use the\
    \ URI scheme; this\n   follows the practice of Security Consideration sections\
    \ within IANA\n   registrations [3].\n   In particular, Section 7 of RFC 3986\
    \ [5] describes general security\n   considerations for URI schemes.  The definition\
    \ of an individual URI\n   scheme should note which of these apply to the specified\
    \ scheme.\n"
- title: 2.8.  Scheme Name Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.8.  Scheme Name Considerations\n   Section 3.1 of RFC 3986 defines the syntax\
    \ of a URI scheme name.  New\n   scheme registrations MUST comply.  Note that\
    \ although scheme names\n   are case insensitive, scheme names MUST be registered\
    \ using lowercase\n   letters.\n   URI scheme names should be short, but also\
    \ sufficiently descriptive\n   and distinguished to avoid problems.\n   Avoid\
    \ names or other symbols that might cause problems with rights to\n   use the\
    \ name in IETF specifications and Internet protocols.  For\n   example, be careful\
    \ with trademark and service mark names.  (See\n   Section 7.4 of RFC 3978 [4].)\n\
    \   Avoid using names that are either very general purpose or associated\n   in\
    \ the community with some other application or protocol.  Avoid\n   scheme names\
    \ that are overly general or grandiose in scope (e.g.,\n   that allude to their\
    \ \"universal\" or \"standard\" nature when the\n   described namespace is not.)\n\
    \   Organizations that desire a private name space for URI scheme names\n   are\
    \ encouraged to use a prefix based on their domain name, expressed\n   in reverse\
    \ order.  For example, a URI scheme name of com-example-info\n   might be registered\
    \ by the vendor that owns the example.com domain\n   name.\n"
- title: 3.  Guidelines for Provisional URI Scheme Registration
  contents:
  - "3.  Guidelines for Provisional URI Scheme Registration\n   While the guidelines\
    \ in Section 2 are REQUIRED for permanent\n   registration, they are RECOMMENDED\
    \ for provisional registration.  For\n   a provisional registration, the following\
    \ are REQUIRED:\n   o  The scheme name meets the syntactic requirements of Section\
    \ 2.8.\n   o  There is not already an entry with the same URI scheme name.  (In\n\
    \      the unfortunate case that there are multiple, different uses of\n     \
    \ the same scheme name, the IESG may approve a request to modify an\n      existing\
    \ entry to note the separate use.)\n   o  Contact information identifying the\
    \ person supplying the\n      registration is included.  Previously unregistered\
    \ URI schemes\n      discovered in use may be registered by third parties on behalf\
    \ of\n      those who created the URI scheme; in this case, both the\n      registering\
    \ party and the scheme creator SHOULD be identified.\n   o  If no permanent, citable\
    \ specification for the URI scheme\n      definition is included, credible reasons\
    \ for not providing it\n      should be given.\n   o  A valid Security Considerations\
    \ section, as required by Section 6\n      of [3].\n   o  If the scheme definition\

    \  In this case, it is\n   possible for an individual to request that the URI\
    \ scheme be\n   registered (newly, or as an update to an existing registration)\
    \ as\n   'historical'.  Any scheme that is no longer in common use MAY be\n  \

    \   1.  Check the IANA URI scheme registry to see whether or not there is\n  \
    \     already an entry for the desired name.  If there is already an\n       entry\
    \ under the name, choose a different URI scheme name.\n   2.  Prepare a URI scheme\
    \ registration template, as specified in\n       Section 5.4.  The URI scheme\
    \ registration template may be\n       contained in an Internet Draft, alone or\

    \ name.\n      See Section 2.8 for guidelines.\n   Status.\n      This reflects\

- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This document replaces the current \"URL Scheme\"\
    \ registry with a new\n   Uniform Resource Identifier scheme registry, and establishes\
    \ a new\n   registration template and a new process for registration.  The\n \
    \  process is based on [3] \"Expert Review\" with an initial (optional)\n   mailing\
    \ list review.\n   The template has an additional field for the status of the\
    \ URI name\n   scheme, and the procedures for entering new name schemes have been\n\
    \   augmented.  Section 5 establishes the process for new URI scheme\n   registration.\n\
    \   To transition to the new registry, all URL name schemes in the\n   existing\
    \ table should be entered as URI schemes, with 'permanent'\n   status.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   All registered values are expected to contain\
    \ accurate security\n   consideration sections; 'permanent' registered scheme\
    \ names are\n   expected to contain complete definitions.\n   Information concerning\
    \ possible security vulnerabilities of a\n   protocol may change over time.  Consequently,\
    \ claims as to the\n   security properties of a registered URI scheme may change\
    \ as well.\n   As new vulnerabilities are discovered, information about such\n\
    \   vulnerabilities may need to be attached to existing documentation, so\n  \
    \ that users are not misled as to the true security properties of a\n   registered\
    \ URI scheme.\n"
