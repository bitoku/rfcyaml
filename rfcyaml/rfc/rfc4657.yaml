  - "1.  Introduction\n   A Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] supports requests\
    \ for path\n   computation issued by a Path Computation Client (PCC), which may\
    \ be\n   'composite' (co-located) or 'external' (remote) from a PCE.  When the\n\
    \   PCC is external from the PCE, a request/response communication\n   protocol\
    \ is required to carry the path computation request and return\n   the response.\
    \  In order for the PCC and PCE to communicate, the PCC\n   must know the location\
    \ of the PCE; PCE discovery is described in\n   [PCE-DISC-REQ].\n   The PCE operates\
    \ on a network graph in order to compute paths based\n   on the path computation\
    \ request(s) issued by the PCC(s).  The path\n   computation request will include\
    \ the source and destination of the\n   paths to be computed and a set of constraints\
    \ to be applied during\n   the computation, and it may also include an objective\
    \ function.  The\n   PCE response includes the computed paths or the reason for\
    \ a failed\n   computation.\n   This document lists a set of generic requirements\
    \ for the PCE\n   Communication Protocol (PCECP).  Application-specific requirements\n\
    \   are beyond the scope of this document, and will be addressed in\n   separate\
    \ documents.  For example, application-specific communication\n   protocol requirements\
    \ are given in [PCECP-INTER-AREA] and\n   [PCECP-INTER-LAYER] for inter-area and\
    \ inter-layer PCE applications,\n   respectively.\n"

  - "4.  Overview of PCE Communication Protocol (PCECP)\n   In the PCE model, path\
    \ computation requests are issued by a PCC to a\n   PCE that may be composite\
    \ (co-located) or external (remote).  If the\n   PCC and PCE are not co-located,\
    \ a request/response communication\n   protocol is required to carry the request\
    \ and return the response.\n   If the PCC and PCE are co-located, a communication\
    \ protocol is not\n   required, but implementations may choose to utilize a protocol\
    \ for\n   exchanges between the components.\n   In order for a PCC and PCE to\
    \ communicate, the PCC must know the\n   location of the PCE.  This can be configured\
    \ or discovered.  The PCE\n   discovery mechanism is out of scope of this document,\
    \ but\n   requirements are documented in [PCE-DISC-REQ].\n   The PCE operates\
    \ on a network graph built from the TED in order to\n   compute paths.  The mechanism\
    \ by which the TED is populated is out of\n   scope for the PCECP.\n   A path\
    \ computation request issued by the PCC includes a specification\n   of the path(s)\
    \ needed.  The information supplied includes, at a\n   minimum, the source and\
    \ destination for the paths, but may also\n   include a set of further requirements\
    \ (known as constraints) as\n   described in Section 5.\n   The response from\
    \ the PCE may be positive in which case it will\n   include the paths that have\
    \ been computed.  If the computation fails\n   or cannot be performed, a negative\
    \ response is required with an\n   indication of the type of failure.\n   A request/response\
    \ protocol is also required for a PCE to communicate\n   path computation requests\
    \ to another PCE and for that PCE to return\n   the path computation response.\
    \  As described in [RFC4655], there is\n   no reason to assume that two different\
    \ protocols are needed, and this\n   document assumes that a single protocol will\
    \ satisfy all requirements\n   for PCC-PCE and PCE-PCE communication.\n   [RFC4655]\
    \ describes four models of PCE: composite, external, multiple\n   PCE path computation,\
    \ and multiple PCE path computation with inter-\n   PCE communication.  In all\
    \ cases except the composite PCE model, a\n   PCECP is required.  The requirements\
    \ defined in this document are\n   applicable to all models described in [RFC4655].\n"

    \ in order to ensure interoperability.  The transport protocol\n   MUST NOT limit\
    \ the size of the message used by the PCECP.\n"
- title: 5.1.4.  Path Computation Requests
  contents:
  - "5.1.4.  Path Computation Requests\n   The path computation request message MUST\
    \ include at least the source\n   and destination.  Note that the path computation\
    \ request is for an\n   LSP or LSP segment, and the source and destination supplied\
    \ are the\n   start and end of the computation being requested (i.e., of the LSP\n\
    \   segment).\n   The path computation request message MUST support the inclusion\
    \ of a\n   set of one or more path constraints, including but not limited to the\n\
    \   requested bandwidth or resources (hops, affinities, etc.) to\n   include/exclude.\
    \  For example, a PCC may request the PCE to exclude\n   points of failure in\
    \ the computation of a new path if an LSP setup\n   fails.  The actual inclusion\
    \ of constraints is a choice for the PCC\n   issuing the request.  A list of core\
    \ constraints that must be\n   supported by the PCECP is supplied in Section 5.1.16.\
    \  Specification\n   of constraints MUST be future-proofed as described in Section\
    \ 5.1.14.\n   The requester MUST be allowed to select from or prefer an advertised\n\
    \   list or minimal subset of standard objective functions and functional\n  \
    \ options.  An objective function is used by the PCE to process\n   constraints\
    \ to a path computation request when it computes a path in\n   order to select\
    \ the \"best\" candidate paths (e.g., minimum hop path),\n   and corresponds to\
    \ the optimization criteria used for the computation\n   of one path, or the synchronized\
    \ computation of a set of paths.  In\n   the case of unsynchronized path computation,\
    \ this can be, for\n   example, the path cost or the residual bandwidth on the\
    \ most loaded\n   path link.  In the case of synchronized path computation, this\
    \ can\n   be, for example, the global bandwidth consumption or the residual\n\
    \   bandwidth on the most loaded network link.\n   A list of core objective functions\
    \ that MUST be supported by the\n   PCECP is supplied in Section 5.1.17.  Specification\
    \ of objective\n   functions MUST be future-proofed as described in Section 5.1.14.\n\
    \   The requester SHOULD also be able to select a vendor-specific or\n   experimental\
    \ objective function or functional option.  Furthermore,\n   the requester MUST\
    \ be allowed to customize the function/options in\n   use.  That is, individual\
    \ objective functions will often have\n   parameters to be set in the request\
    \ from PCC to PCE.  Support for the\n   specification of objective functions and\
    \ objective parameters is\n   required in the protocol extensibility specified\
    \ in Section 5.1.14.\n   A request message MAY include TE parameters carried by\
    \ the MPLS/GMPLS\n   LSP setup signaling protocol.  Also, it MUST be possible\
    \ for the PCE\n   to apply additional objective functions.  This might include\
    \ policy-\n   based routing path computation for load balancing instructed by\
    \ the\n   management plane.\n   Shortest path selection may rely either on the\
    \ TE metric or on the\n   IGP metric [METRIC].  Hence the PCECP request message\
    \ MUST allow the\n   PCC to indicate the metric type (IGP or TE) to be used for\
    \ shortest\n   path selection.  Note that other metric types may be specified\
    \ in the\n   future.\n   There may be cases where a single path cannot fit a given\
    \ bandwidth\n   request, while a set of paths could be combined to fit the request.\n\
    \   Such path combination to serve a given request is called load-\n   balancing.\
    \  The request message MUST allow the PCC to indicate if\n   load-balancing is\
    \ allowed.  It MUST also include the maximum number\n   of paths in a load-balancing\
    \ path group, and the minimum path\n   bandwidth in a load-balancing path group.\
    \  The request message MUST\n   allow specification of the degree of disjointness\
    \ of the members of\n   the load-balancing group.\n"
- title: 5.1.5.  Path Computation Responses
  contents:
  - "5.1.5.  Path Computation Responses\n   The path computation response message\
    \ MUST allow the PCE to return\n   various elements including, at least, the computed\
    \ path(s).\n   The protocol MUST be capable of returning any explicit path that\n\
    \   would be acceptable for use for MPLS and GMPLS LSPs once converted to\n  \
    \ an Explicit Route Object for use in RSVP-TE signaling.  In addition,\n   anything\
    \ that can be expressed in an Explicit Route Object MUST be\n   capable of being\
    \ returned in the computed path.  Note that the\n   resultant path(s) may be made\
    \ up of a set of strict or loose hops, or\n   any combination of strict and loose\
    \ hops.  Moreover, a hop may have\n   the form of a non-simple abstract node.\
    \  See [RFC3209] for the\n   definition of strict hop, loose hop, and abstract\
    \ node.\n   A positive response from the PCE MUST include the paths that have\n\

    \ inclusion of a set of attributes of the computed path, such as\n   the path\
    \ costs (e.g., cumulative link TE metrics and cumulative link\n   IGP metrics)\

  - "5.1.12.  Asynchronous Communication\n   The PCC-PCE protocol MUST allow for asynchronous\
    \ communication.  A\n   PCC MUST NOT have to wait for a response to one request\
    \ before it can\n   make another request.\n   It MUST also be possible to have\
    \ the order of responses differ from\n   the order of the corresponding requests.\
    \  This may occur, for\n   instance, when path request messages have different\
    \ priorities (see\n   Requirement 5.1.10).  A consequent requirement is that path\n\
    \   computation responses MUST include a direct correlation to the\n   associated\
    \ request.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.13.  Communication Overhead Minimization\n   The request and response messages\
    \ SHOULD be designed so that the\n   communication overhead is minimized.  In\
    \ particular, the overhead per\n   message SHOULD be minimized, and the number\
    \ of bytes exchanged to\n   arrive at a computation answer SHOULD be minimized.\
    \  Other\n   considerations in overhead minimization include the following:\n\
    \   - the number of background messages used by the protocol or its\n     transport\
    \ protocol to keep alive any session or association\n     between the PCE and\
    \ PCC\n   - the processing cost at the PCE (or PCC) associated with\n     request/response\
    \ messages (as distinct from processing the\n     computation requests themselves)\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.14.  Extensibility\n   The PCECP MUST provide a way for the introduction\
    \ of new path\n   computation constraints, diversity types, objective functions,\n\
    \   optimization methods and parameters, and so on, without requiring\n   major\
    \ modifications in the protocol.\n   For example, the PCECP MUST be extensible\
    \ to support various PCE-\n   based applications, such as the following:\n   -\
    \ intra-area path computation\n   - inter-area path computation [PCECP-INTER-AREA]\n\
    \   - inter-AS intra provider and inter-AS inter-provider path\n     computation\
    \ [PCECP-INTER-AS]\n   - inter-layer path computation [PCECP-INTER-LAYER]\n  \
    \ The PCECP MUST support the requirements specified in the\n   application-specific\
    \ requirements documents.  The PCECP MUST also\n   allow extensions as more PCE\
    \ applications will be introduced in the\n   future.\n   The PCECP SHOULD also\
    \ be extensible to support future applications\n   not currently in the scope\
    \ of the PCE working group, such as, for\n   instance, point-to-multipoint path\

    \ can be bundled in path request messages, for\n   example, 10 PCECP request messages/second\
    \ may correspond to 100 path\n   requests/second.\n   Bursts of requests may arise,\
    \ for example, after a network outage\n   when multiple recomputations are requested.\
    \  The PCECP MUST handle\n   the congestion in a graceful way so that it does\

- title: 5.3.3.  LSP Rerouting & Reoptimization
  contents:
  - "5.3.3.  LSP Rerouting & Reoptimization\n   If an LSP fails owing to the failure\
    \ of a link or node that it\n   traverses, a new computation request may be made\
    \ to a PCE in order to\n   repair the LSP.  Since the PCC cannot know that the\
    \ PCE's TED has\n   been updated to reflect the failure network information, it\
    \ is useful\n   to include this information in the new path computation request.\n\
    \   Also, in order to re-use the resources used by the old LSP, it may be\n  \
    \ advantageous to indicate the route of the old LSP as part of the new\n   path\
    \ computation request.\n   Hence the path computation request message MUST allow\
    \ an indication\n   of whether the computation is for LSP restoration, and it\
    \ MUST\n   support the inclusion of the previously computed path as well as the\n\
    \   identity of the failed element.  Note that the old path might only be\n  \
    \ useful if the old LSP has not yet been torn down.  The PCE MAY choose\n   to\
    \ take failure indication information carried in a given request\n   into account\
    \ when handling subsequent requests.  This should be\n   driven by local policy\
    \ decision.\n   Note that a network failure may impact a large number of LSPs.\
    \  In\n   this case, a potentially large number of PCCs will simultaneously\n\
    \   send requests to the PCE.  The PCECP MUST properly handle such\n   overload\
    \ situations, such as, for instance, through throttling of\n   requests as set\
    \ forth in Section 5.1.8.\n   The path computation request message MUST support\
    \ TE LSP path\n   reoptimization and the inclusion of a previously computed path.\
    \  This\n   will help ensure optimal routing of a reoptimized path, since it will\n\
    \   allow the PCE to avoid double bandwidth accounting and help reduce\n   blocking\
    \ issues.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Key management MUST be provided by the PCECP\
    \ to provide for the\n   authenticity and integrity of PCECP messages.  This will\
    \ allow\n   protecting against PCE or PCC impersonation and also against message\n\
    \   content falsification.\n   The impact of the use of a PCECP MUST be considered\
    \ in light of the\n   impact that it has on the security of the existing routing\
    \ and\n   signaling protocols and techniques in use within the network.\n   Intra-domain\
    \ security is impacted since there is a new interface,\n   protocol, and element\
    \ in the network.  Any host in the network could\n   impersonate a PCC and receive\
    \ detailed information on network paths.\n   Any host could also impersonate a\
    \ PCE, both gathering information\n   about the network before passing the request\
    \ on to a real PCE and\n   spoofing responses.  Some protection here depends on\
    \ the security of\n   the PCE discovery process (see [PCE-DISC-REQ]).  An increase\
    \ in\n   inter-domain information flows may increase the vulnerability to\n  \
    \ security attacks, and the facilitation of inter-domain paths may\n   increase\
    \ the impact of these security attacks.\n   Of particular relevance are the implications\
    \ for confidentiality\n   inherent in a PCECP for multi-domain networks.  It is\
    \ not necessarily\n   the case that a multi-domain PCE solution will compromise\
    \ security,\n   but solutions MUST examine their impacts in this area.\n   Applicability\
    \ statements for particular combinations of signaling,\n   routing, and path computation\
    \ techniques are expected to contain\n   detailed security sections.\n   It should\
    \ be observed that the use of an external PCE introduces\n   additional security\
    \ issues.  Most notable among these are the\n   following:\n   - Interception\
    \ of PCE requests or responses\n   - Impersonation of PCE or PCC\n   - DoS attacks\
    \ on PCEs or PCCs\n   The PCECP MUST address these issues in detail using authentication,\n\
    \   encryption, and DoS protection techniques.  See also Section 5.1.9.\n   There\
    \ are security implications of allowing arbitrary objective\n   functions, as\
    \ discussed in Section 5.1.17, and the PCECP MUST allow\n   mitigating the risk\
    \ of, for example, a PCC using complex objectives\n   to intentionally drive a\
    \ PCE into resource exhaustion.\n"

  - "7.  Manageability Considerations\n   Manageability of the PCECP MUST address\

    \ monitoring of PCECP\n   - The need for built-in diagnostic tools to test the\
    \ operation of the\n     protocol (e.g., partner failure detection, Operations\n\
    \     Administration and Maintenance (OAM), etc.)\n   - Configuration implications\
    \ for the protocol\n   PCECP operations MUST be modeled and controlled through\
    \ appropriate\n   MIB modules.  There are enough specific differences between\
    \ PCCs and\n   PCEs to lead to the need of defining separate MIB modules.\n  \
    \ Statistics gathering will form an important part of the operation of\n   the\
    \ PCECP.  The MIB modules MUST provide information that will allow\n   an operator\
    \ to determine PCECP historical interactions and the\n   success rate of requests.\
    \  Similarly, it is important for an operator\n   to be able to determine PCECP\
    \ and PCE load and whether an individual\n   PCC is responsible for a disproportionate\
    \ amount of the load.  It\n   MUST be possible, through use of MIB modules, to\
    \ record and inspect\n   statistics about the PCECP communications, including\
    \ issues such as\n   malformed messages, unauthorized messages, and messages discarded\n\
    \   owing to congestion.\n   The new MIB modules should also be used to provide\
    \ notifications\n   (traps) when thresholds are crossed or when important events\
    \ occur.\n   For example, the MIB module may support indication of exceeding the\n\
    \   congestion state threshold or rate limitation state.\n   PCECP techniques\
    \ must enable a PCC to determine the liveness of a PCE\n   both before it sends\
    \ a request and in the period between sending a\n   request and receiving a response.\n\
    \   It is also important for a PCE to know about the liveness of PCCs to\n   gain\
    \ a predictive view of the likely loading of a PCE in the future\n   and to allow\
    \ a PCE to abandon processing of a received request.\n   The PCECP MUST support\
    \ indication of congestion state and rate\n   limitation state, and MAY allow\
    \ the operator to control such a\n   function.\n"
