- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is intended to provide updated information\
    \ on the\n   registration of the MIME Media Type \"application/pdf\", with\n \
    \  particular focus on the features that help mitigate security\n   concerns.\
    \  This document refers to features documented in the PDF\n   References versions\
    \ 1 [1], 1.3 [2], 1.4 [3] and 1.5 [4], as updated\n   by errata [5].\n   PDF is\
    \ used widely in the Internet Community.  Since PDF was\n   introduced in 1993,\
    \ it has grown to be a widely-used format for\n   capturing and exchanging formatted\
    \ documents electronically, across\n   the Web, via e-mail, and, for that matter,\
    \ virtually every other\n   document exchange mechanism.\n   PDF represents formatted\
    \ documents.  These documents may be\n   structured or simple.  They may contain\
    \ text, images, graphics, and\n   other multimedia content, such as video and\
    \ audio.  There is support\n   for annotations, metadata, hypertext links, and\
    \ bookmarks.\n   PDF supports encryption and digital signatures in the document.\
    \  The\n   encryption capability is also combined with access control\n   information\
    \ in a way that is intended to manage the uses that a\n   recipient can make of\
    \ a document.\n   PDF usage is specified in other international standards.  ISO\
    \ 15930-\n   1:2001 PDF/X [16] has been adopted as the exchange standard for\n\
    \   electronic documents within the Prepress community.  PDF/X is a\n   profile\
    \ of PDF that references the PDF Reference, Third edition [2],\n   as the source\
    \ specification.\n   Another profile of PDF, known as PDF/A [17], is being developed\
    \ for\n   use as an international standard as an electronic document file\n  \
    \ format for long-term preservation.  Following the work on PDF/X, the\n   activity\
    \ is joint work between NPES (The Association for Suppliers of\n   Printing, Publishing\
    \ and Converting Technologies) and AIIM\n   International (the Association for\
    \ Information and Image Management,\n   International).  AIIM is the secretariat\
    \ for ISO/TC 171 SC2, Document\n   Imaging Applications.\n   PDF usage is widespread\
    \ enough for 'application/pdf' to be used in\n   other IETF specifications.  RFC\
    \ 2346 [15] describes how to better\n   structure PDF files for international\
    \ exchange of documents where\n   different paper sizes are used; HTTP byte range\
    \ retrieval is\n   illustrated using application/pdf (RFC 2616 [14], Section 19.2);\
    \ RFC\n   3297 [13] illustrates how PDF can be sent to a recipient that\n   identifies\
    \ his ability to accept the PDF using content negotiation.\n"
- title: 2.  History
  contents:
  - "2.  History\n   PDF was originally envisioned as a way to communicate and view\n\
    \   printed information electronically across a wide variety of machine\n   configurations,\
    \ operating systems, and communication networks in a\n   reliable manner.\n  \
    \ PDF relies on the same imaging model as the PostScript page\n   description\
    \ language to render complex text, images, and graphics in\n   a device and resolution-independent\
    \ manner, bringing this feature to\n   the screen as well as the printer.  To\
    \ improve performance for\n   interactive viewing, PDF defines a more structured\
    \ format than that\n   used by most PostScript language programs.  PDF also includes\n\
    \   objects, such as hypertext links and annotations, that are not part\n   of\
    \ the page itself, but are useful for building collections of\n   related documents\
    \ and for reviewing and commenting on documents.\n   The application/pdf media\
    \ type was first registered in 1993 by Paul\n   Lindner for use by the gopher\
    \ protocol; the registration was\n   subsequently updated in 1994 by Steve Zilles.\n"
- title: 3.  Fragment Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.  Fragment Identifiers\n   The handling of fragment identifiers [6] is currently\
    \ defined in\n   Adobe Technical Note 5428 [7].  This section summarizes that\n\
    \   material.\n   A fragment identifier consists of one or more PDF-open parameters\
    \ in\n   a single URL, separated by the ampersand (&) or pound (#) character.\n\
    \   Each parameter implies an action to be performed and the value to be\n   used\
    \ for that action.  Actions are processed and executed from left\n   to right\
    \ as they appear in the character string that makes up the\n   fragment identifier.\n\
    \   The PDF-open parameters allow the specification of a particular page\n   or\
    \ named destination to open.  Named destinations are similar to the\n   \"anchors\"\
    \ used in HTML or the IDs used in XML.  Once the target is\n   specified, the\
    \ view of the page in which it occurs can be specified,\n   either by specifying\
    \ the position of a viewing rectangle and its\n   scale or size coordinates or\
    \ by specifying a view relative to the\n   viewing window in which the chosen\
    \ page is to be presented.\n   The list of PDF-open parameters and the action\
    \ they imply is:\n   nameddest=<name>\n      Open to a specified named destination\
    \ (which includes a view).\n   page=<pagenum>\n      Open the specified (physical)\
    \ page.\n   zoom=<scale>,<left>,<top>\n      Set the <scale> and scrolling factors.\
    \ <left>, and <top> are\n      measured from the top left corner of the page,\
    \ independent of the\n      size of the page.  The pair <left> and <top> are optional\
    \ but both\n      must appear if present.\n   view=<keyword>,<position>\n    \
    \  Set the view to show some specified portion of the page or its\n      bounding\
    \ box; keywords are defined by Table 8.2 of the PDF\n      Reference, version\
    \ 1.5.  The <position> value is required for some\n      of the keywords and not\
    \ allowed for others.\n   viewrect=<left>,<top>,<wd>,<ht>\n      As with the zoom\
    \ parameter, set the scale and scrolling factors,\n      but using an explicit\
    \ width and height instead of a scale\n      percentage.\n   highlight=<lt>,<rt>,<top>,<btm>\n\
    \      Highlight a rectangle on the chosen page where <lt>, <rt>, <top>,\n   \
    \   and <btm> are the coordinates of the sides of the rectangle\n      measured\
    \ from the top left corner of the page.\n   All specified actions are executed\
    \ in order; later actions will\n   override the effects of previous actions; for\
    \ this reason, page\n   actions should appear before zoom actions.  Commands are\
    \ not case\n   sensitive (except for the value of a named destination).\n"
- title: 4.  Encryption
  contents:
  - "4.  Encryption\n   PDF files allow access to be controlled using encryption and\n\
    \   permission settings.  A document's data decryption keys and\n   permission\
    \ settings are provided by encryption handlers.  An\n   'Encryption Dictionary'\
    \ is provided in the document trailer to enable\n   encryption handlers to store\
    \ document-specific information.\n   Different encryption handlers can provide\
    \ for different sets of\n   permissions.  The PDF encoding rules for password\
    \ and public key\n   encryption handlers are specified in the PDF Reference.\n\
    \   A person that is able to 'access' a document is said to be able to\n   open\
    \ and view the document.  Access is possible when a person can\n   provide the\
    \ key with which to decrypt the document.  The key is\n   protected and provided\
    \ by the encryption handler.  Encryption\n   handlers will normally require some\
    \ sort of authentication before a\n   person can access the document decryption\
    \ key.\n   Encryption of PDF files is normally applied to all string and stream\n\
    \   data in the document, and only to string and stream data.  By\n   encrypting\
    \ only data portions of the PDF file, random access to PDF\n   file contents is\
    \ maintained.  The data is normally encrypted using\n   the 40 to 128-bit RC4\
    \ [8] encryption algorithm.  Use of decryption\n   filters allow algorithms other\
    \ than RC4 to be used.\n   The person that has access to a document will be given\
    \ certain\n   permissions for the document.  A person that has full permissions,\n\
    \   including permission to save a document without encryption, is said\n   to\
    \ be an 'owner'.  A person that has restricted permissions is said\n   to be a\
    \ 'user'.  Example permissions include the ability to copy text\n   and other\
    \ content from the PDF file, the ability to fill in form\n   field data, and the\
    \ ability to print the PDF file.  Enforcement of\n   permissions is the responsibility\
    \ of the viewing application.\n   Password encryption allows the possibility of\
    \ two different passwords\n   to be used when providing access to the document.\
    \  The 'author'\n   password allows access to the document and full permissions,\n\
    \   including the permission to save the document without encryption.\n   The\
    \ 'user' password allows access to the document, but access is\n   restricted\
    \ by a set of permissions.\n   Public key encryption of PDF files uses one or\
    \ more PKCS#7 [9]\n   objects to store information regarding recipients that are\
    \ able to\n   open a document.  Each PKCS#7 object contains a list of recipients,\
    \ a\n   document decryption key, and permission settings that apply to all\n \
    \  recipients listed for that PKCS#7 object.  The document decryption\n   key\
    \ is protected with a triple-DES key that is encrypted once with\n   the public\
    \ key of each listed recipient.\n"
- title: 5.  Digital Signatures
  contents:
  - "5.  Digital Signatures\n   A digital signature can be used to authenticate the\
    \ identity of a\n   user and the validity of a document's contents.  PDF supports\
    \ the\n   association of a digital signature with a complete record that is\n\
    \   needed to reproduce a visual representation of what a person saw when\n  \
    \ they signed the PDF file.  PDF digital signatures allows for multiple\n   signers\
    \ to update and sign the same document; a subsequent user may\n   then view the\
    \ state of the document at each point when any individual\n   signature was applied.\n\
    \   The full specification for PDF digital signatures is contained in the\n  \
    \ PDF Reference [4] section 8.7 and Appendix I; an overview is provided\n   here.\n\
    \   PDF signature information is stored in a 'signature dictionary' data\n   structure.\
    \  A signature is created by computing a digest of the data\n   stored in the\
    \ document.  To verify the signature, the digest is\n   recomputed and compared\
    \ with the one stored in the document.\n   Differences in the digest values indicate\
    \ that modifications have\n   been made since the document was signed.\n   All\
    \ bytes of the PDF file are covered by the signature digest,\n   including the\
    \ signature dictionary, but excluding the signature value\n   itself.  The range\
    \ of bytes is defined and stored as the value of the\n   ByteRange key in the\
    \ signature dictionary.  The ByteRange value is an\n   array of integer pairs,\
    \ where each pair includes a starting byte\n   offset and length in bytes.  There\
    \ are two pairs, one describing the\n   range of bytes preceding the signature\
    \ value, and the other\n   describing the range of bytes that occur after the\
    \ signature value.\n   PDF public key digital signature syntax is specified for\
    \ PKCS#1 [11]\n   and PKCS#7 [9] signatures.  In both cases, all bytes of the\
    \ PDF file\n   are signed, with the exclusion of the PKCS#1 or PKCS#7, signature\n\
    \   value, objects.\n   The signature dictionary contains additional attributes.\
    \  The\n   'SubFilter' attribute describes the encoding of the signature value,\n\
    \   and the 'Contents' attribute contains the signature value which is\n   normally\
    \ hex (base16) encoded.  There are currently three recommended\n   SubFilter types:\n\
    \   adbe.x509.rsa_sha1\n      In this case, the Contents key contains a DER-encoded\
    \ PKCS#1 [11]\n      binary data object representing the signature obtained as\
    \ the RSA\n      encryption of the byte range SHA-1 digest with the signer's\n\
    \      private key.  When using PKCS#1, the certificate chain of the\n      signer\
    \ is included with other signature information in the signed\n      document.\n\
    \   adbe.pkcs7.sha1\n      In this case, the value of Contents is a DER-encoded\
    \ PKCS#7 binary\n      data object containing the signature.  The SHA1 digest\
    \ of the byte\n      range is encapsulated in the PKCS#7 signed-data field with\n\
    \      ContentInfo of type \"data\".\n   adbe.pkcs7.detached\n      In this case,\
    \ the value of Contents is a DER-encoded PKCS#7 binary\n      data object containing\
    \ the signature.  No data is encapsulated in\n      the PKCS#7 signed-data field.\n\
    \   If the type of signature is 'adbe.x509.rsa_sha1', the signature\n   dictionary\
    \ includes a key named 'Cert', which contains at least the\n   signer's X.509\
    \ public-key certificate represented as a binary string.\n   The value could also\
    \ be an array of strings where the first entry is\n   the signer's certificate\
    \ and the following entries are one or more\n   issuer certifications from the\
    \ signer's trust chain.\n   If the type of signature is 'adbe.pkcs7.sha1' or\n\
    \   'adbe.pkcs7.detached', the 'Cert' key is not used and the certificate\n  \
    \ must be put in the PKCS#7 object stored in the 'Contents' key.  The\n   minimum\
    \ required certificate to include in the PKCS#7 object is the\n   signer's X.509\
    \ signing certificate.  It may also optionally contain\n   one or more issuer\
    \ certifications from the signer's trust chain.\n   Multiple signatures are supported\
    \ using the incremental save\n   capabilities of PDF.  When changes to a file\
    \ are made and a new\n   signature is applied to the document, the changes are\
    \ appended after\n   the last byte of the previously existing document and then\
    \ the new\n   signature digest is of all bytes of the new file.  In this manner,\n\
    \   changes can be made to a document and new signatures added to a\n   document\
    \ without invalidating earlier signatures that have been\n   applied to the PDF\
    \ file.  Any change to a document is detected\n   because all bytes of the PDF\
    \ file are digested.\n   The state of a signed document, when an earlier signature\
    \ of a\n   multiple signature document was applied, can be viewed by extracting\n\
    \   the earlier set of bytes of the file and opening them in a PDF\n   viewing\
    \ application.  This process is called 'rollback' and allows\n   viewing of the\
    \ exact state of the document when it was signed.\n   PDF syntax allows for 'author'\
    \ and 'user' signatures.  Under normal\n   circumstances the first signature of\
    \ a document is considered an\n   author signature and all other signatures are\
    \ considered user\n   signatures.  Authors can specify what changes are to be\
    \ allowed to\n   the PDF file before the author's signature is presented as invalid.\n\
    \   Example changes include the ability to fill in form field data, the\n   ability\
    \ to add comments to a document, the ability to make no\n   changes, and the ability\
    \ to make any changes.  Changes are detected\n   by opening the existing document\
    \ and the author's version of the\n   document and performing a complete object\
    \ compare of the two\n   documents.  Change detection is not a substitute for\
    \ the legal value\n   of document rollback.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  PDF Implementations\n   There are a number of widely available, independently\
    \ implemented,\n   interoperable implementations of PDF for a wide variety of\
    \ platforms\n   and systems.  Because PDF is a publicly available specification,\n\
    \   hundreds of companies and organizations make PDF creation, viewing,\n   and\
    \ manipulation tools.  For examples, see descriptions or tools\n   lists from\
    \ Adobe [20], Apple [21], Ghostscript [22], Planet PDF [18],\n   and PDFzone.com\
    \ [19].\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   An \"application/pdf\" resource contains information\
    \ to be parsed and\n   processed by the recipient's PDF system.  Because PDF is\
    \ both a\n   representation of formatted documents and a container system for\
    \ the\n   resources need to reproduce or view said documents, it is possible\n\
    \   that a PDF file has embedded resources not described in the PDF\n   Reference.\n\
    \   Although it is not a defined feature of PDF, a PDF processor could\n   extract\
    \ these resources and store them on the recipients system.\n   Furthermore, a\
    \ PDF processor may accept and execute \"plug-in\" modules\n   accessible to the\
    \ recipient.  These may also access material in the\n   PDF file or on the recipients\
    \ system.  Therefore, care in\n   establishing the source, security, and reliability\
    \ of such plug-ins\n   is recommended.  Message-sending software should not make\
    \ use of\n   arbitrary plug-ins without prior agreement on their presence at the\n\
    \   intended recipients.  Message-receiving and -displaying software\n   should\
    \ make sure that any non-standard plug-ins are secure and do not\n   present a\
    \ security threat.\n   PDF may contain \"scripts\" to customize the displaying\
    \ and processing\n   of PDF files.  These scripts are expressed in a version of\
    \ JavaScript\n   [10] based on JavaScript version 1.5 of ISO-16262 (formerly known\
    \ as\n   ECMAScript).  These scripts have access to an API that is similar to\n\
    \   the \"plug-in\" API.  They are intended for execution by the PDF\n   processor.\
    \  User agents executing such scripts or programs must be\n   extremely careful\
    \ to insure that untrusted software is executed in a\n   protected environment.\n\
    \   In addition, JavaScript code might modify the appearance of a PDF\n   document.\
    \  For this reason, validation of digital signatures should\n   take this into\
    \ account.\n   In general, any information stored outside of the direct control\
    \ of\n   the user -- including referenced application software or plug-ins and\n\
    \   embedded files, scripts or other material not covered in the PDF\n   reference\
    \ -- can be a source of insecurity, by either obvious or\n   subtle means.  For\
    \ example, a script can modify the content of a\n   document prior to its being\
    \ displayed.  Thus, the security of any PDF\n   document may be dependent on the\
    \ resources referenced by that\n   document.\n   As noted above, PDF provides\
    \ mechanism for helping insure the\n   integrity of a PDF file, Encryption (Section\
    \ 4), and to be able to\n   digitally sign (Section 5) a PDF file.  The latter\
    \ capability allows\n   a recipient to decide if he is willing to trust the file.\n\
    \   Where there is concern that tampering with the PDF file might be a\n   problem,\
    \ it is recommended that the encryption and digital signature\n   features be\
    \ used to protect and authenticate the PDF.\n   In addition, PDF processors may\
    \ have mechanisms that track the source\n   of scripts or plug-ins and will execute\
    \ only those scripts or plug-\n   ins that meet the processors requirements for\
    \ trustworthiness of the\n   sources.\n"
