    \ to successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all IPv6\n   Internet,\
    \ many interim steps will be taken.  One of these steps is\n   the evolution of\
    \ current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.  It\n   is hoped that these protocols\
    \ (and their implementations) will be\n   redesigned to be network address independent,\
    \ but failing that will\n   at least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To this end,\
    \ all Standards\n   (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will\
    \ be\n   surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.\n"

  - "1.0.  Introduction\n   This document is part of a document set aiming to document\
    \ all usage\n   of IPv4 addresses in IETF standards.  In an effort to have the\n\
    \   information in a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 documents\n  \
    \ conforming to the current IETF areas (Application, Internet,\n   Operations\
    \ and Management, Routing, Security, Sub-IP, and Transport).\n   For a full introduction,\
    \ please see the introduction [1].\n"
- title: 2.0.  Document Organization
  contents:
  - "2.0.  Document Organization\n   Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw\
    \ analysis of Full,\n   Draft, and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.\
    \  Each RFC is\n   discussed in its turn starting with RFC 1 and ending with (around)\n\
    \   RFC 3100. The comments for each RFC are \"raw\" in nature.  That is,\n   each\
    \ RFC is discussed in a vacuum and problems or issues discussed do\n   not \"\
    look ahead\" to see if the problems have already been fixed.\n   Section 7 is\
    \ an analysis of the data presented in Sections 3, 4, 5,\n   and 6.  It is here\
    \ that all of the results are considered as a whole\n   and the problems that\
    \ have been resolved in later RFCs are\n   correlated.\n"
- title: 3.0.  Full Standards
  contents:
  - "3.0.  Full Standards\n   Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred\
    \ to as\n   \"Standards\") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely\n\
    \   implemented and used throughout the Internet.\n"

- title: 4.0.  Draft Standards
  contents:
  - "4.0.  Draft Standards\n   Draft Standards represent the penultimate standard\
    \ level in the IETF.\n   A protocol can only achieve draft standard when there\
    \ are multiple,\n   independent, interoperable implementations.  Draft Standards\
    \ are\n   usually quite mature and widely used.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.  RFC 2617 HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access\n      Authentication\n\
    \      Section 3.2.1 The WWW-Authenticate Response Header include he\n      following\
    \ text:\n         (Note: including the IP address of the client in the nonce\n\
    \         would appear to offer the server the ability to limit the reuse\n  \
    \       of the nonce to the same client that originally got it.\n         However,\
    \ that would break proxy farms, where requests from a\n         single user often\
    \ go through different proxies in the farm.\n         Also, IP address spoofing\
    \ is not that hard.)\n      Section 4.5 Replay Attacks contains the text:\n  \
    \       Thus, for some purposes, it is necessary to protect against\n        \
    \ replay attacks.  A good Digest implementation can do this in\n         various\
    \ ways.  The server created \"nonce\" value is\n         implementation dependent,\
    \ but if it contains a digest of the\n         client IP, a time-stamp, the resource\
    \ ETag, and a private\n         server key (as recommended above) then a replay\
    \ attack is not\n         simple.  An attacker must convince the server that the\
    \ request\n         is coming from a false IP address and must cause the server\
    \ to\n         deliver the document to an IP address different from the\n    \
    \     address to which it believes it is sending the document.  An\n         attack\
    \ can only succeed in the period before the time-stamp\n         expires.  Digesting\
    \ the client IP and time-stamp in the nonce\n         permits an implementation\
    \ which does not maintain state between\n         transactions.\n   Both of these\
    \ statements are IP version independent and must rely on\n   the implementers\
    \ discretion.\n"

    \   Type\n      22 for Framed-Route.\n   Length\n       >= 3\n   Text\n      The\
    \ Text field is one or more octets, and its contents are\n      implementation\
    \ dependent.  It is intended to be human readable and\n      MUST NOT affect operation\
    \ of the protocol.  It is recommended that\n      the message contain UTF-8 encoded\
    \ 10646 [7] characters.\n      For IP routes, it SHOULD contain a destination\
    \ prefix in dotted\n      quad form optionally followed by a slash and a decimal\
    \ length\n      specifier stating how many high order bits of the prefix to use.\n\
    \      That is followed by a space, a gateway address in dotted quad\n      form,\
    \ a space, and one or more metrics separated by spaces.  For\n      example, \"\
    192.168.1.0/24 192.168.1.1 1 2 -1 3 400\".  The length\n      specifier may be\
    \ omitted, in which case it defaults to 8 bits for\n      class A prefixes, 16\
    \ bits for class B prefixes, and 24 bits for\n      class C prefixes.  For example,\
    \ \"192.168.1.0 192.168.1.1 1\".\n      Whenever the gateway address is specified\
    \ as \"0.0.0.0\" the IP\n      address of the user SHOULD be used as the gateway\
    \ address.\n   There are also several example authentication sequences that use\
    \ the\n   attributes discussed above and hence have IPv4 addresses.\n   Although\
    \ the definitions in this RFC are limited to IPv4 addresses,\n   the specification\
    \ is easily extensible for new attribute types.  It\n   is therefore relatively\
    \ simple to create new IPv6 specific\n   attributes.\n"

    \    example:\n         Example 2:  Assume that an X.509v3 certificate is issued\
    \ to\n         /CN=James Hacker/L=Basingstoke/O=Widget Inc/C=GB/ with Subject\n\
    \         Alternate names of (a) domain name widget.foo.example,\n         (b)\
    \ IPv4 address 10.251.13.201, and (c) string \"James Hacker\n         <hacker@mail.widget.foo.example>\"\
    .  Then the storage locations\n         recommended, in priority order, would\
    \ be\n             (1) widget.foo.example,\n             (2) 201.13.251.10.in-addr.arpa,\
    \ and\n             (3) hacker.mail.widget.foo.example.\n   Since the definition\
    \ of X.509v3 certificates is not discussed in this\n   document it is unclear\
    \ if IPv6 addresses are also supported in the\n   above mentioned field.  The\
    \ document does however refer to RFC 2459\n   for the definition of a certificate,\

  - "6.0.  Experimental RFCs\n   Experimental RFCs typically define protocols that\
    \ do not have\n   widescale implementation or usage on the Internet.  They are\
    \ often\n   propriety in nature or used in limited arenas.  They are documented\n\
    \   to the Internet community in order to allow potential\n   interoperability\
    \ or some other potential useful scenario.  In a few\n   cases they are presented\
    \ as alternatives to the mainstream solution\n   to an acknowledged problem.\n\

    \               and an Address Mask.  This list of ranges\n                  \

  - "7.0.  Summary of Results\n   In the initial survey of RFCs 4 positives were identified\
    \ out of a\n   total of 124, broken down as follows:\n         Standards:    \
    \                          0 out of   1 or  0.00%\n         Draft Standards: \
    \                       1 out of   3 or 33.33%\n         Proposed Standards: \
    \                    1 out of 102 or  0.98%\n         Experimental RFCs:     \
    \                 2 out of  18 or 11.11%\n   Of those identified many require\
    \ no action because they document\n   outdated and unused protocols, while others\
    \ are document protocols\n   that are actively being updated by the appropriate\
    \ working groups.\n   Additionally there are many instances of standards that\
    \ should be\n   updated but do not cause any operational impact if they are not\n\
    \   updated.  The remaining instances are documented below.\n"

    \ 1949)\n      This specification relies on IPv4 IGMP Multicast and a new\n  \
    \    specification may be produced; however, the SMKD is not believed\n      to\
    \ be in use.\n   7.4.2.  OPSF with Digital Signatures (RFC 2154)\n      This specification\
    \ is IPv4-only, and relies on an IPv4-only\n      routing protocol, OSPFv2.  Due\
    \ to increased focus on routing\n      security, this specification may need to\
    \ be revisited, and in that\n      case it should support both OSPFv2 and OPSFv3.\n"
