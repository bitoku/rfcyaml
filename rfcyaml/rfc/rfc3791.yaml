    \ successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all\n   IPv6 Internet,\
    \ many interim steps will be taken.  One of these steps\n   is the evolution of\
    \ current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.\n   It is hoped that these protocols\
    \ (and their implementations) will be\n   redesigned to be network address independent,\
    \ but failing that will\n   at least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To this end,\
    \ all Standards\n   (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will\
    \ be\n   surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.\nTable of Contents\n\

    \ all usage of IPv4 addresses in currently\n   deployed IETF Routing Area documented\
    \ standards.  Also, throughout\n   this document there are discussions on how\
    \ routing protocols might be\n   updated to support IPv6 addresses.\n   This material\
    \ was originally presented within a single document, but\n   in an effort to have\
    \ the information in a manageable form, it has\n   subsequently been split into\
    \ 7 documents conforming to the current\n   IETF main areas (Application [2],\
    \ Internet [3], Operations &\n   Management [4], Routing [this document], Security\
    \ [5], Sub-IP [6] and\n   Transport [7]).\n   The general overview, methodology\
    \ used during documentation and scope\n   of the investigation for the whole 7\
    \ documents can be found in the\n   introduction of this set of documents [1].\n\
    \   It is important to mention that to perform this study the following\n   classes\
    \ of IETF standards are investigated: Full, Draft, and\n   Proposed, as well as\
    \ Experimental.  Informational, BCP and Historic\n   RFCs are not addressed. \
    \ RFCs that have been obsoleted by either\n   newer versions or as they have transitioned\
    \ through the standards\n   process are also not covered.\n2.  Document Organization\n\
    \   The main Sections of this document are described below.\n   Sections 3, 4,\
    \ 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis of Full,\n   Draft, Proposed Standards\
    \ and Experimental RFCs.  Each RFC is\n   discussed in its turn starting with\
    \ RFC 1 and ending (around) RFC\n   3100.  The comments for each RFC are \"raw\"\
    \ in nature.  That is, each\n   RFC is discussed in a vacuum and problems or issues\
    \ discussed do not\n   \"look ahead\" to see if the problems have already been\
    \ fixed.\n   Section 7 is an analysis of the data presented in Sections 3, 4,\
    \ 5,\n   and 6.  It is here that all of the results are considered as a whole\n\
    \   and the problems that have been resolved in later RFCs are\n   correlated.\n\
    3.  Full Standards\n   Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred\
    \ to as\n   \"Standards\") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely\n\
    \   implemented and used throughout the Internet.\n3.1.  RFC 1722 (STD 57) RIP\
    \ Version 2 Protocol Applicability Statement\n   RIPv2 is only intended for IPv4\
    \ networks.\n3.2.  RFC 2328 (STD 54) OSPF Version 2\n   This RFC defines a protocol\
    \ for IPv4 routing.  It is highly\n   assumptive about address formats being IPv4\
    \ in nature.\n3.3.  RFC 2453 (STD 56) RIP Version 2\n   RIPv2 is only intended\
    \ for IPv4 networks.\n4.  Draft Standards\n   Draft Standards represent the penultimate\
    \ standard level in the IETF.\n   A protocol can only achieve draft standard when\
    \ there are multiple,\n   independent, interoperable implementations.  Draft Standards\
    \ are\n   usually quite mature and widely used.\n4.1.  RFC 1771 A Border Gateway\
    \ Protocol 4 (BGP-4)\n   This RFC defines a protocol used for exchange of IPv4\
    \ routing\n   information and does not support IPv6 as is defined.\n4.2.  RFC\
    \ 1772 Application of the Border Gateway Protocol in the\n   Internet\n   This\
    \ RFC is a discussion of the use of BGP-4 on the Internet.\n4.3.  RFC 3392 Capabilities\
    \ Advertisement with BGP-4\n   Although the protocol enhancements have no IPv4\
    \ dependencies, the\n   base protocol, BGP-4, is IPv4 only.\n5.  Proposed Standards\n\
    \   Proposed Standards are introductory level documents.  There are no\n   requirements\
    \ for even a single implementation.  In many cases\n   Proposed are never implemented\
    \ or advanced in the IETF standards\n   process.  They therefore are often just\
    \ proposed ideas that are\n   presented to the Internet community.  Sometimes\
    \ flaws are exposed or\n   they are one of many competing solutions to problems.\
    \  In these later\n   cases, no discussion is presented as it would not serve\
    \ the purpose\n   of this discussion.\n5.1.  RFC 1195 Use of OSI IS-IS for routing\
    \ in TCP/IP and dual\n      environments\n   This document specifies a protocol\
    \ for the exchange of IPv4 routing\n   information.\n5.2.  RFC 1370 Applicability\
    \ Statement for OSPF\n   This document discusses a version of OSPF that is limited\
    \ to IPv4.\n5.3.  RFC 1397 Default Route Advertisement In BGP2 and BGP3 Version\
    \ of\n      The Border Gateway Protocol\n   BGP2 and BGP3 are both deprecated\
    \ and therefore are not discussed in\n   this document.\n5.4.  RFC 1478 An Architecture\
    \ for Inter-Domain Policy Routing\n   The architecture described in this document\
    \ has no IPv4 dependencies.\n5.5.  RFC 1479 Inter-Domain Policy Routing Protocol\
    \ Specification:\n      Version 1 (IDPR)\n   There are no IPv4 dependencies in\
    \ this protocol.\n5.6.  RFC 1517 Applicability Statement for the Implementation\
    \ of\n      Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)\n   This document deals exclusively\
    \ with IPv4 addressing issue.\n5.7.  RFC 1518 An Architecture for IP Address Allocation\
    \ with CIDR\n   This document deals exclusively with IPv4 addressing issue.\n\
    5.8.  RFC 1519 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): an Address\n      Assignment\
    \ and Aggregation Strategy\n   This document deals exclusively with IPv4 addressing\
    \ issue.\n5.9.  RFC 1582 Extensions to RIP to Support Demand Circuits\n   This\
    \ protocol is an extension to a protocol for exchanging IPv4\n   routing information.\n\
    5.10.  RFC 1584 Multicast Extensions to OSPF\n   This document defines the use\
    \ of IPv4 multicast to an IPv4 only\n   routing protocol.\n5.11.  RFC 1793 Extending\
    \ OSPF to Support Demand Circuits\n   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol\
    \ other than the fact\n   that it is a new functionality for a routing protocol\
    \ that only\n   supports IPv4 networks.\n5.12.  RFC 1997 BGP Communities Attribute\n\
    \   Although the protocol enhancements have no IPv4 dependencies, the\n   base\
    \ protocol, BGP-4, is IPv4 only.\n5.13.  RFC 2080 RIPng for IPv6\n   This RFC\
    \ documents a protocol for exchanging IPv6 routing information\n   and is not\
    \ discussed in this document.\n5.14.  RFC 2091 Triggered Extensions to RIP to\
    \ Support Demand Circuits\n   This RFC defines an enhancement for an IPv4 routing\
    \ protocol and\n   while it has no IPv4 dependencies it is inherently limited\
    \ to IPv4.\n5.15.  RFC 2338 Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)\n   This\
    \ protocol is IPv4 specific, there are numerous references to 32-\n   bit IP addresses.\n\
    5.16.  RFC 2370 The OSPF Opaque LSA Option\n   There are no IPv4 dependencies\
    \ in this protocol other than the fact\n   that it is a new functionality for\
    \ a routing protocol that only\n   supports IPv4 networks.\n5.17.  RFC 2439 BGP\
    \ Route Flap Damping\n   The protocol enhancements have no IPv4 dependencies,\
    \ even though the\n   base protocol, BGP-4, is IPv4 only routing protocol.\n5.18.\
    \  RFC 2545 Use of BGP-4 Multiprotocol Extensions for IPv6 Inter-\n       Domain\
    \ Routing\n   This RFC documents IPv6 routing methods and is not discussed in\
    \ this\n   document.\n5.19.  RFC 2740 OSPF for IPv6\n   This document defines\
    \ an IPv6 specific protocol and is not discussed\n   in this document.\n5.20.\
    \  RFC 2784 Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)\n   This protocol is only defined\
    \ for IPv4.  The document states in the\n   Appendix:\n      o  IPv6 as Delivery\
    \ and/or Payload Protocol\n   This specification describes the intersection of\
    \ GRE currently\n   deployed by multiple vendors. IPv6 as delivery and/or payload\n\
    \   protocol is not included.\n5.21.  RFC 2796 BGP Route Reflection - An Alternative\
    \ to Full Mesh IBGP\n   Although the protocol enhancements have no IPv4 dependencies,\
    \ the\n   base protocol, BGP-4, is IPv4 only routing protocol.  This\n   specification\
    \ updates but does not obsolete RFC 1966.\n5.22.  RFC 2858 Multiprotocol Extensions\
    \ for BGP-4\n   In the Abstract:\n   Currently BGP-4 is capable of carrying routing\
    \ information only for\n   IPv4.  This document defines extensions to BGP-4 to\
    \ enable it to\n   carry routing information for multiple Network Layer protocols\
    \ (e.g.,\n   IPv6, IPX, etc...).  The extensions are backward compatible - a\n\
    \   router that supports the extensions can interoperate with a router\n   that\
    \ doesn't support the extensions.\n   The document is therefore not examined further\
    \ in this document.\n5.23.  RFC 2890 Key and Sequence Number Extensions to GRE\n\
    \   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.\n5.24.  RFC 2894 Router Renumbering\
    \ for IPv6\n   The RFC defines an IPv6 only document and is not concerned in this\n\
    \   survey.\n5.25.  RFC 2918 Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4\n   Although the\
    \ protocol enhancements have no IPv4 dependencies, the\n   base protocol, BGP-4,\
    \ is IPv4 only routing protocol.\n5.26.  RFC 3065 Autonomous System Confederations\
    \ for BGP\n   Although the protocol enhancements have no IPv4 dependencies, the\n\
    \   base protocol, BGP-4, is IPv4 only routing protocol.\n5.27.  RFC 3101 The\
    \ OSPF Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA) Option\n   This document defines an extension\
    \ to an IPv4 routing protocol.\n5.28.  RFC 3107 Carrying Label Information in\
    \ BGP-4\n   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.\n5.29.  RFC 3122\
    \ Extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery for Inverse\n      Discovery Specification\n\
    \   This is an IPv6 related document and is not discussed in this\n   document.\n\
    6.  Experimental RFCs\n   Experimental RFCs typically define protocols that do\
    \ not have wide\n   scale implementation or usage on the Internet.  They are often\n\
    \   propriety in nature or used in limited arenas.  They are documented\n   to\
    \ the Internet community in order to allow potential\n   interoperability or some\
    \ other potential useful scenario.  In a few\n   cases they are presented as alternatives\
    \ to the mainstream solution\n   to an acknowledged problem.\n6.1.  RFC 1075 Distance\
    \ Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP)\n   This document defines a protocol\
    \ for IPv4 multicast routing.\n6.2.  RFC 1383 An Experiment in DNS Based IP Routing\n\
    \   This proposal is IPv4 limited:\n   This record is designed for easy general\
    \ purpose extensions in the\n   DNS, and its content is a text string.  The RX\
    \ record will contain\n   three fields: A record identifier, A cost indicator,\
    \ and An IP\n   address.\n   The three strings will be separated by a single comma.\
    \  An example of\n   record would thus be:\n   ___________________________________________________________________\n\
    \   |         domain          |   type |   record |   value           |\n   |\
    \            -            |        |          |                   |\n   |*.27.32.192.in-addr.arpa\
    \ |   IP   |    TXT   |   RX, 10, 10.0.0.7|\n   |_________________________|________|__________|___________________|\n\
    \   which means that for all hosts whose IP address starts by the three\n   octets\
    \ \"192.32.27\" the IP host \"10.0.0.7\" can be used as a gateway,\n   and that\
    \ the preference value is 10.\n6.3.  RFC 1476 RAP: Internet Route Access Protocol\n\
    \   This document defines an IPv7 routing protocol and has been abandoned\n  \
    \ by the IETF as a feasible design.  It is not considered in this\n   document.\n\
    6.4.  RFC 1765 OSPF Database Overflow\n   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this\
    \ protocol other than the fact\n   that it is a new functionality for a routing\
    \ protocol that only\n   supports IPv4 networks.\n6.5.  RFC 1863 A BGP/IDRP Route\
    \ Server alternative to a full mesh\n      routing\n   This protocol is both IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 aware and needs no changes.\n6.6.  RFC 1966 BGP Route Reflection An\
    \ alternative to full mesh IBGP\n   Although the protocol enhancements have no\
    \ IPv4 dependencies, the\n   base protocol, BGP-4, is IPv4 only routing protocol.\
    \  This\n   specification has been updated by RFC 2796.\n6.7.  RFC 2189 Core Based\
    \ Trees (CBT version 2) Multicast Routing\n   The document specifies a protocol\
    \ that depends on IPv4 multicast.\n   There are many packet formats defined that\
    \ show IPv4 usage.\n6.8.  RFC 2201 Core Based Trees (CBT) Multicast Routing Architecture\n\
    \   See previous Section for the IPv4 limitation in this protocol.\n6.9.  RFC\
    \ 2337 Intra-LIS IP multicast among routers over ATM using\n      Sparse Mode\
    \ PIM\n   This protocol is designed for IPv4 multicast.\n6.10.   RFC 2362 Protocol\
    \ Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM):\n      Protocol Specification\n\
    \   This protocol is both IPv4 and IPv6 aware and needs no changes.\n6.11.  RFC\
    \ 2676 QoS Routing Mechanisms and OSPF Extensions\n   There are IPv4 dependencies\
    \ in this protocol.  It requires the use of\n   the IPv4 TOS header field.\n7.\
    \  Summary of Results\n   In the initial survey of RFCs, 23 positives were identified\
    \ out of a\n   total of 46, broken down as follows:\n         Standards:     \
    \                    3 out of  3 or 100.00%\n         Draft Standards:       \
    \            1 out of  3 or  33.33%\n         Proposed Standards:            \
    \   13 out of 29 or  44.83%\n         Experimental RFCs:                 6 out\
    \ of 11 or  54.54%\n   Of those identified many require no action because they\
    \ document\n   outdated and unused protocols, while others are document protocols\n\
    \   that are actively being updated by the appropriate working groups.\n   Additionally\
    \ there are many instances of standards that should be\n   updated but do not\
    \ cause any operational impact if they are not\n   updated.  The remaining instances\
    \ are documented below.  The authors\n   have attempted to organize the results\
    \ in a format that allows easy\n   reference to other protocol designers.  The\
    \ assignment of statements\n   has been based entirely on the authors perceived\
    \ needs for updates\n   and should not be taken as an official statement.\n7.1.\
    \  Standards\n7.1.1.  STD 57 RIP Version 2 Protocol Applicability Statement (RFC\
    \ 1722)\n   This problem has been fixed by RFC 2081, RIPng Protocol Applicability\n\
    \   Statement.\n7.1.2.  STD 54 OSPF Version 2 (RFC 2328)\n   This problem has\
    \ been fixed by RFC 2740, OSPF for IPv6.\n7.1.3.  STD 56 RIP Version 2 (RFC 2453)\n\
    \   This problem has been fixed by RFC 2080, RIPng for IPv6.\n7.2.  Draft Standards\n\
    7.2.1.  Border Gateway Protocol 4 (RFC 1771)\n   This problem has been fixed in\
    \ RFC 2858 Multiprotocol Extensions for\n   BGP-4, RFC 2545 Use of BGP-4 Multiprotocol\
    \ Extensions for IPv6\n   Inter-Domain Routing, and in [8].\n   RFC 2858 extends\
    \ BGP to support multi-protocol extensions that allows\n   routing information\
    \ for other address families to be exchanged.  RFC\n   2545 further extends RFC\
    \ 2858 for full support of exchanging IPv6\n   routing information and additionally\
    \ clarifies support of the\n   extended BGP-4 protocol using TCP+IPv6 as a transport\
    \ mechanism.  RFC\n   1771, 2858 & 2545 must be supported in order to provide\
    \ full IPv6\n   support.\n   Note also that all the BGP extensions analyzed previously\
    \ in this\n   memo function without changes with the updated version of BGP-4.\n\
    7.3.  Proposed Standards\n7.3.1.  Use of OSI IS-IS for routing in TCP/IP and dual\
    \ environments\n        (RFC 1195)\n   This problem is being addressed by the\
    \ IS-IS WG [9].\n7.3.2.  Applicability Statement for OSPFv2 (RFC 1370)\n   This\
    \ problem has been resolved in RFC 2740, OSPF for IPv6.\n7.3.3.  Applicability\
    \ of CIDR (RFC 1517)\n   The contents of this specification has been treated in\
    \ various IPv6\n   addressing architecture RFCs, see RFC 3513 & 3587.\n7.3.4.\
    \  CIDR Architecture (RFC 1518)\n   The contents of this specification has been\
    \ treated in various IPv6\n   addressing architecture RFCs, see RFC 3513 & 3587.\n\
    7.3.5.  Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): an Address Assignment\n       \
    \ and Aggregation Strategy (RFC 1519)\n   The contents of this specification has\
    \ been treated in various IPv6\n   addressing architecture RFCs, see RFC 3513\
    \ & 3587.\n7.3.6.  RIP Extensions for Demand Circuits (RFC 1582)\n   This problem\
    \ has been addressed in RFC 2080, RIPng for IPv6.\n7.3.7.  OSPF Multicast Extensions\
    \ (RFC 1584)\n   This functionality has been covered in RFC 2740, OSPF for IPv6.\n\
    7.3.8.  OSPF For Demand Circuits (RFC 1793)\n   This functionality has been covered\
    \ in RFC 2740, OSPF for IPv6.\n7.3.9.  RIP Triggered Extensions for Demand Circuits\
    \ (RFC 2091)\n   This functionality is provided in RFC 2080, RIPng for IPv6.\n\
    7.3.10.  Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)(RFC 2338)\n   The problems\
    \ identified are being addressed by the VRRP WG [10].\n7.3.11.  OSPF Opaque LSA\
    \ Option (RFC 2370)\n   This problem has been fixed by RFC 2740, OSPF for IPv6.\
    \  Opaque\n   options support is an inbuilt functionality in OSPFv3.\n7.3.12.\
    \  Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)(RFC 2784)\n   Even though GRE tunneling\
    \ over IPv6 has been implemented and used,\n   its use has not been formally specified.\
    \  Clarifications are\n   required.\n7.3.13.  OSPF NSSA Option (RFC 3101)\n  \
    \ This functionality has been covered in RFC 2740, OSPF for IPv6.\n7.4.   Experimental\
    \ RFCs\n7.4.1.  Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (RFC 1075)\n   This\
    \ protocol is a routing protocol for IPv4 multicast routing.  It\n   is no longer\
    \ in use and need not be redefined.\n7.4.2.  An Experiment in DNS Based IP Routing\
    \ (RFC 1383)\n   This protocol relies on IPv4 DNS RR, but is no longer relevant\
    \ has\n   never seen much use; no action is necessary.\n7.4.3.  Core Based Trees\
    \ (CBT version 2) Multicast Routing (RFC 2189)\n   This protocol relies on IPv4\
    \ IGMP Multicast and a new protocol\n   standard may be produced.  However, the\
    \ multicast routing protocol\n   has never been in much use and is no longer relevant;\
    \ no action is\n   necessary.\n7.4.4.  Core Based Trees (CBT) Multicast Routing\
    \ Architecture (RFC 2201)\n   See previous Section for the limitation in this\
    \ protocol.\n7.4.5.  Intra-LIS IP multicast among routers over ATM using Sparse\n\
    \        Mode PIM (RFC 2337)\n   This protocol is designed for IPv4 multicast.\
    \  However, Intra-LIS IP\n   multicast among routers over ATM is not believed\
    \ to be relevant\n   anymore.  A new mechanism may be defined for IPv6 multicast.\n\
    7.4.6.  QoS Routing Mechanisms and OSPF Extensions (RFC 2676)\n   QoS extensions\
    \ for OSPF were never used for OSPFv2, and there seems\n   to be little need for\
    \ them in OSPFv3.\n   However, if necessary, an update to this document could\
    \ simply define\n   the use of the IPv6 Traffic Class field since it is defined\
    \ to be\n   exactly the same as the IPv4 TOS field.\n8.  Security Considerations\n\
    \   This document examines the IPv6-readiness of routing specification;\n   this\
    \ does not have security considerations in itself.\n9.  Acknowledgements\n   The\
