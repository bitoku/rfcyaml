  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is a standardisation development\n\
    \   organisation in the field of distributed computing.  The OGF produces\n  \
    \ documents such as working drafts, specifications, and schemata.  For\n   more\
    \ information, see <http://www.ogf.org/>.\n   Working groups in the OGF community\
    \ have expressed the need for\n   global, distributed, persistent identifiers\
    \ in working drafts and\n   standards.  Motivated by this need, the OGF would\
    \ like to assign URNs\n   to some resources in order to retain unique, permanent,\
    \ location-\n   independent names for them.\n   This namespace specification is\
    \ for a formal namespace.\n"

- title: 2.4.  Declaration of Syntactic Structure
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Declaration of Syntactic Structure\n   The formal syntax definitions below\
    \ are given in ABNF [RFC5234].\n   The namespace-specific string (NSS) in the\
    \ urn:ogf names hierarchy\n   begins with a subnamespace identifier (SNID), followed\
    \ by a delimiter\n   and a subnamespace-dependent string\n      OGF-URN  =  \"\
    urn:ogf:\" SNID \":\" SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING\n   where <SNID> is a unique\
    \ subnamespace identifier for the\n   specification, and <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING>\
    \ is a unique\n   identifier within the subnamespace identifier scope.\n   <SNID>\
    \ has the same syntax as a <NID> as defined in [RFC2141]:\n      SNID  =  ( ALPHA\
    \ / DIGIT )  *31( ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" )\n   ALPHA and DIGIT are defined in Appendix\
    \ B of [RFC5234].\n   The Technical Director at OGF (or their successors) assigns\
    \ SNIDs.\n   The syntax of <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING> is dependent on the\n\
    \   <SNID> and MUST be defined by a Grid Forum Document [GFD.1].  This\n   document\
    \ does not pose any additional restrictions to the\n   <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING>\
    \ other than what is defined in the NSS\n   syntax as defined by [RFC2141] or\
    \ its successor:\n      SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*<URN chars>\n   <URN\
    \ chars> is defined in Section 2.2 of [RFC2141].\n"
- title: 2.5.  Relevant Ancillary Documentation
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Relevant Ancillary Documentation\n   The Technical Director at OGF (or\
    \ their successors) will keep a list\n   of assigned subnamespace identifiers\
    \ and associated documentation at\n   <http://www.ogf.org/urn/> [URN-OGF].\n \
    \  The procedures regarding how to register a subnamespace identifier\n   are\
    \ described in [GFD.191] and can also be found at the above\n   Website.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Identifier Uniqueness Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Identifier Uniqueness Considerations\n   Identifier uniqueness will be\
    \ enforced by the Technical Director of\n   the Open Grid Forum.\n   The OGF Technical\
    \ Director may sub-delegate part of the namespace to\n   third parties.  It will\
    \ not be permissible, neither by the OGF nor\n   any third party, to re-assign\
    \ previously assigned URNs.  A practical\n   consequence is that a previously\
    \ assigned subnamespace cannot be\n   re-assigned, unless additional arrangements\
    \ are made to prevent\n   identifier re-assignments.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Identifier Persistence Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Identifier Persistence Considerations\n   The Technical Director will only\
    \ assign subnamespace identifiers for\n   persistent resources.\n   In order to\
    \ enforce identifier persistence for individual resources,\n   each document defining\
    \ subnamespace identifiers MUST contain a\n   section on the type of resource\
    \ that is specified (e.g., whether a\n   URN in the subnamespace identifies a\
    \ specific version of a resource,\n   the latest version of a resource, a specific\
    \ manifestation, or a more\n   general concept).\n   The namespace identifier\
    \ \"ogf\" MUST NOT change, even if the Open Grid\n   Forum changes its name or\
    \ is disbanded.\n"
- title: 2.8.  Process of Identifier Assignment
  contents:
  - "2.8.  Process of Identifier Assignment\n   Assignment of subnamespace identifiers\
    \ is limited to the OGF and\n   those authorities that are specifically designated\
    \ by the OGF\n   Technical Director of the OGF.  The OGF may assign portions of\
    \ its\n   namespace (specifically, those under designated subnamespace\n   identifiers)\
    \ for assignment by third parties.\n   The details of this process are specified\
    \ in [GFD.191].\n   The syntax and semantics of each subnamespace MUST be defined\
    \ by a\n   Grid Forum Document [GFD.1] before the corresponding SNID is\n   assigned.\n"
- title: 2.9.  Process of Identifier Resolution
  contents:
  - "2.9.  Process of Identifier Resolution\n   The OGF namespace is not currently\
    \ listed with a Resolution Discovery\n   System (RDS), but nothing about the namespace\
    \ prohibits the future\n   definition of appropriate resolution methods or listing\
    \ with an RDS.\n   The OGF will maintain an index of all subnamespace identifiers\
    \ on its\n   Website <http://www.ogf.org/urn/>.  This list may refer to known\n\
    \   Resolution Discovery Systems.\n"
- title: 2.10.  Rules for Lexical Equivalence
  contents:
  - "2.10.  Rules for Lexical Equivalence\n   The <SNID> part of URNs in the OGF hierarchy\
    \ is case insensitive.\n   Thus, the <SNID> MUST be case normalised before comparison.\n\
    \   The rules for lexical equivalence of the\n   <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING>\
    \ part of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is\n   specific for each SNID and MUST be\
    \ defined when a SNID is assigned by\n   the OGF Technical Director.  These definitions\
    \ MUST include\n   information about case sensitivity, and in the case of %-escaped\n\
    \   octets, MUST define the exact normalisation to be used (e.g.,\n   interpret\
    \ as octet, interpret as UTF-8, specify type of Unicode\n   normalisation factor,\
    \ etc.).\n"
- title: 2.11.  Conformance with URN Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.11.  Conformance with URN Syntax\n   The intention of this document is to only\
    \ restrict the syntax of the\n   <SNID>.  The syntax of the <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING>\
    \ follows the\n   general syntax of a URN:\n      SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING\
    \  =  1*<URN chars>\n   Documents defining a subnamespace identifier SHOULD specify\
    \ further\n   syntactic restrictions in <SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING>.  It is\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED that these documents forbid the assignment of URNs\n   containing\
    \ characters in the <reserved> set (\"%\", \"/\", \"?\", and \"#\")\n   as defined\
    \ in [RFC2141].  This is in accordance with Section 2.2 of\n   [RFC3986].\n  \
    \ For forward compatibility, it is RECOMMENDED that software\n   implementations\
    \ that don't validate subnamespace-specific strings\n   validate the syntax according\
    \ to the generic rules for validating\n   URIs, as defined in [RFC3986].  URIs\
    \ may contain all characters\n   defined in <URN chars>, including the characters\
    \ in <reserved>\n   (albeit they have a special meaning), as well as the characters\
    \ \"&\"\n   and \"~\".\n"
- title: 2.12.  Validation Mechanism
  contents:
  - "2.12.  Validation Mechanism\n   The validation mechanism of URNs in the OGF hierarchy\
    \ is specific for\n   each SNID and SHOULD be defined when a SNID is assigned\
    \ by the OGF\n   Technical Director.\n   URNs in the OGF hierarchy without an\
    \ assigned SNID are considered to\n   be invalid.\n"
- title: 2.13.  Scope
  contents:
  - "2.13.  Scope\n   Global URNs are relevant for the distributed computing community\
    \ in\n   general, and the Open Grid Forum in particular.\n"
- title: 3.  Examples (Informative)
  contents:
  - "3.  Examples (Informative)\n   Since no subnamespace identifiers have been defined\
    \ yet, no actual\n   examples can be given.  Therefore, the following examples\
    \ are not\n   guaranteed to be real or even syntactically correct.\n   Grid Forum\
    \ Documents defining the \"gfd\" and \"network\" subnamespace\n   identifiers\
    \ may give the following examples.\n   o  urn:ogf:gfd:136\n   o  urn:ogf:network:canarie.ca:kisti-uninett-glif-001\n"
- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is a standardisation\
    \ development\n   organisation in the field of distributed computing.\n   The\
    \ use of the OGF hierarchy is expected to be broad, including but\n   not limited\
    \ to usage for:\n   o  Grid Forum Documents\n   o  XML (Extensible Markup Language)\
    \ Schemata\n   o  RDF (Resource Description Framework) Schemata\n   The Open Grid\
    \ Forum is dedicated to openly publishing all technical\n   documentation related\
    \ to URNs in the OGF hierarchy and allowing\n   unlimited distribution of these\
    \ documents.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   Members of the distributed computing community\
    \ will benefit from\n   persistent and globally unique identifiers for use in\
    \ protocols\n   developed by the Open Grid Forum.\n   Practical use of the urn:ogf\
    \ namespace has been detected, and a\n   formal registration will allow the Open\
    \ Grid Forum to document this\n   usage and enforce technical review of current\
    \ practices.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are no additional security considerations\
    \ other than those\n   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs\
    \ in general,\n   which are described in [RFC1737], [RFC2141], and [RFC3406].\n\
    \   It is recommended that implementers check the OGF registry and\n   documentation\
    \ [URN-OGF] before assuming that a given identifier is\n   valid or has a certain\
    \ meaning.\n"
- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has registered the \"ogf\" namespace identifier\
    \ (NID) with a\n   reference to this document in the \"Formal URN Namespaces\"\
