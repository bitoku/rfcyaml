  - "1.  Introduction\n   ETSI is a nonprofit international industry standards organization\n\
    \   that produces globally acceptable standards for information and\n   communication\
    \ technologies including fixed, mobile, radio, broadcast,\n   internet, aeronautical,\
    \ and other areas.\n   As part of these efforts, there is a need to specify identifiers\
    \ in a\n   managed namespace that are unique and persistent.  To ensure that\n\
    \   this namespace's uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a\n   specific\
    \ Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC8141] Namespace Identifier\n   (NID) for use\
    \ by ETSI is specified in this document, in full\n   conformance with the NID\
    \ registration process specified in [RFC8141].\n"

- title: 2.  URN Specification for ETSI
  contents:
  - "2.  URN Specification for ETSI\n   Namespace Identifier:\n      etsi\n   Version:\n\
    \      1\n   Date:\n      2018-10-22\n   Registrant:\n      ETSI Protocol Naming\
    \ and Numbering Service (PNNS)\n      European Telecommunications Standards Institute\
    \ (ETSI)\n      650, Route des Lucioles\n      Sophia Antipolis 06560\n      France\n\
    \      Email: pnns@etsi.org\n   Purpose:\n      The Namespace Identifier (NID)\
    \ \"etsi\" for Uniform Resource Names\n      (URNs) will be used to identify resources\
    \ published by ETSI.\n      These might include published standards or protocols\
    \ that ETSI\n      defines and that make use of URNs.  These namespaces are globally\n\
    \      unique.  The URN namespace will be used in public networks by\n      clients\
    \ to configure and manage resources in the network.  Servers\n      will enforce\
    \ the uniqueness of the namespaces by using the\n      namespace and the XPath\
    \ associated with the managed node in the\n      network when accessing a resource.\n\
    \   Syntax:\n      The syntax of Namespace Specific Strings for the \"etsi\" namespace\n\
    \      is <NSS> in Uniform Resource Names (URNs) [RFC8141].\n      The entire\
    \ URN is case-insensitive.\n   Assignment:\n      ETSI will maintain the list\
    \ of registered subtrees that use the\n      \"etsi\" NID in the \"ETSI URN Namespace\"\
    \ registry at\n      <https://portal.etsi.org/PNNS/GenericAllocation/\n      ETSIURNNamespace.aspx>.\
    \  The registry describes the <NSS>, how\n      namespaces will be allocated,\
    \ and how experimental namespaces can\n      be used within the allocated URN.\n\
    \      ETSI will manage resource classes using the \"etsi\" NID and will be\n\
    \      the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent\n      strings.\
    \  ETSI will guarantee the uniqueness of the strings by\n      validating them\
    \ against the existing content of the registry.\n      ETSI may also permit secondary\
    \ responsibility for certain defined\n      resources.  Once a subtree assignment\
    \ is made, it cannot be\n      deleted or reassigned.\n      ETSI may allow use\
    \ of experimental type values in specific\n      subtrees for testing purposes\
    \ only.  Note that using experimental\n      types may create collision as multiple\
    \ users may use the same\n      values for different resources and specific strings.\
    \  All\n      experimentation must follow the guidance set forth in \"A Uniform\n\
    \      Resource Name (URN) Namespace for Examples\" [RFC6963].\n   Security and\
    \ Privacy:\n      See Section 4 of RFC 8515.\n   Interoperability:\n      There\
    \ are no known interoperability issues at this time.\n   Resolution:\n      It\
    \ is not foreseen that URNs within this namespace will undergo\n      resolution.\n\
    \   Documentation:\n      Documentation can be found at\n      <https://portal.etsi.org/PNNS/GenericAllocation/\n\
    \      ETSIURNNamespace.aspx>.\n"
- title: 3.  Examples
  contents:
  - "3.  Examples\n   The following are examples of URNs that ETSI is looking to assign:\n\
    \      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-nfv\n      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-nfv-vnf\n      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-nfv-pnf\n\
    \   Although all of these examples are related to network management with\n  \
    \ YANG [RFC7950], URNs related to other kinds of resources might be\n   assigned\
    \ in the future, in which case a \"sub-identifier\" other than\n   \"yang\" might\
    \ be created.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   There are no additional security considerations\
    \ apart from what are\n   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs\
    \ in general,\n   which are described in \"Functional Requirements for Uniform\
    \ Resource\n   Names\" [RFC1737] and \"Uniform Resource Names (URNs)\" [RFC8141].\n"
