Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP).
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), version 1 [16] or version 2 [17].
A future version of this MIB will support IGMP version 3 (currently a work in progress).
All of this MIB module is applicable to IPv4 multicast routers; a subset is applicable to hosts implementing IGMP.
Since IGMP is specific to IPv4, this MIB does not support management of equivalent functionality for other address families, such as IPv6.
Such management may be supported by other MIBs.
The SNMP Network Management Framework
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
This MIB module contains two tables: (1)  the IGMP Interface Table which contains one row for each interface on which IGMP is enabled, and (2)  the IGMP Cache Table which contains one row for each IP multicast group for which there are members on a particular interface.
Both tables are intended to be implemented by hosts and routers, but some columnar objects in each table apply only to routers.

" DESCRIPTION "The MIB module for IGMP Management."
SEQUENCE OF IgmpInterfaceEntry MAX ACCESS
current DESCRIPTION "The (conceptual) table listing the interfaces on which IGMP is enabled."
MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
An entry (conceptual row) representing an interface on which IGMP is enabled."
The ifIndex value of the interface for which IGMP is enabled."
{ igmpInterfaceEntry 1 } igmpInterfaceQueryInterval OBJECT
"The activation of a row enables IGMP on the interface.
The destruction of a row disables IGMP on the interface."
igmpInterfaceEntry 3 } igmpInterfaceVersion OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"The version of IGMP which is running on this interface.
This object can be used to configure a router capable of running either value.
For IGMP to function correctly, all routers on a LAN must be configured to run the same version of IGMP on that LAN.
"The amount of time remaining before the Other Querier Present Timer expires.
If the local system is the querier, the value of this object is zero."
"The time remaining until the host assumes that there are no IGMPv1 routers present on the interface.
While this is non  zero, the host will reply to all queries with version 1 membership reports."
"The number of queries received whose IGMP version does not match igmpInterfaceVersion, over the lifetime of the row entry.
IGMP requires that all routers on a LAN be configured to run the same version of IGMP.
Thus, if any queries are received with the wrong version, this indicates a configuration error."
"The number of times a group membership has been added on this interface; that is, the number of times an entry for this interface has been added to the Cache Table.
This object gives an indication of the amount of IGMP activity over the lifetime of the row entry."
"Some devices implement a form of IGMP proxying whereby memberships learned on the interface represented by this row, cause IGMP Host Membership Reports to be sent on the interface whose ifIndex value is given by this object.
Such a device would implement the igmpV2RouterMIBGroup only on its router interfaces (those interfaces with non zero igmpInterfaceProxyIfIndex).
Typically, the value of this object is 0, indicating that no proxying is being done."
The Robustness Variable allows tuning for the expected packet loss on a subnet.
If a subnet is expected to be lossy, the Robustness Variable may be increased.
IGMP is robust to (Robustness Variable 1) packet losses."
The Last Member Query Interval is the Max Response Time inserted into Group Specific Queries sent in response to Leave Group messages, and is also the amount of time between Group Specific Query messages.
This value may be tuned to modify the leave latency of the network.
A reduced value results in reduced time to detect the loss of the last member of a group.
The value of this object is irrelevant if igmpInterfaceVersion is 1."
current DESCRIPTION "The (conceptual) table listing the IP multicast groups for which there are members on a particular interface."
An entry (conceptual row) in the igmpCacheTable."
IpAddress MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
"The IP multicast group address for which this entry contains information."
The interface for which this entry contains information for an IP multicast group address."
"An indication of whether the local system is a member of this group address on this interface."
The IP address of the source of the last membership report received for this IP Multicast group address on this interface.
If no membership report has been received, this object has the value 0.0.0.0."
The time elapsed since this entry was created."
The minimum amount of time remaining before this entry will be aged out.
A value of 0 indicates that the entry is only present because igmpCacheSelf is true and that if the router left the group, this entry would be aged out immediately.
Note that some implementations may process membership reports from the local system in the same way as reports from other hosts, so a value of 0 is not required."
} igmpCacheStatus OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"The status of this entry."
"The time remaining until the local router will assume that there are no longer any IGMP version 1 members on the IP subnet attached to this interface.
Upon hearing any IGMPv1 Membership Report, this value is reset to the group membership timer.
While this time remaining is non zero, the local router ignores any IGMPv2 Leave messages for this group that it receives on this interface."

"A collection of optional objects for IGMP hosts.

OBJECT GROUP OBJECTS { igmpInterfaceVersion, igmpInterfaceQuerier, igmpInterfaceQueryMaxResponseTime,
igmpInterfaceRobustness, igmpInterfaceWrongVersionQueries, igmpInterfaceLastMembQueryIntvl, igmpCacheVersion1HostTimer } STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"A collection of additional objects for management of IGMP version 2 in routers."
OBJECT GROUP OBJECTS { igmpInterfaceProxyIfIndex } STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"A collection of additional objects for management of IGMP proxy devices."
Some of these objects could contain sensitive information.
In particular, the igmpCacheSelf and igmpCacheLastReporter can be used to identify machines which are listening to a given group address.
There are also a number of objects that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read  create, which allow an administrator to configure IGMP in the router.
While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively innocuous, unauthorized access to the write
able objects could cause a denial of service.
Hence, the support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
by itself is such an insecure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and SET (change/create/delete)
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View based Access Control Model RFC 2575
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
