  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Library of Congress, on behalf of and in collaboration\
    \ with\n   various components of the metadata and information retrieval\n   community,\
    \ has issued specifications that define formats for\n   representation of various\
    \ forms of information including metadata and\n   search results.  This memo provides\
    \ information about the media types\n   associated with several of these formats,\
    \ all of which are XML\n   schemas.\n   MODS: Metadata Object Description Schema.\
    \  An XML schema for a\n      bibliographic element set that may be used for a\
    \ variety of\n      purposes, and particularly for library applications.\n   MADS:\
    \ Metadata Authority Description Schema.  An XML schema for an\n      authority\
    \ element set used to provide metadata about agents\n      (people, organizations),\
    \ events, and terms (topics, geographics,\n      genres, etc.).  It is a companion\
    \ to MODS.\n   METS: Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard.  An XML schema\
    \ for\n      encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata\n \
    \     regarding objects within a digital library.\n   MARCXML: MARC21 XML Schema.\
    \  An XML schema for the direct XML\n      representation of the MARC format (for\
    \ which there already exists\n      a media type, application/marc; see [RFC2220]).\
    \  By \"direct XML\n      representation\", we mean that it encodes the actual\
    \ MARC data\n      within XML.  (This is in contrast to MODS: MARC uses codes\
    \ for its\n      element names; MODS represents the same information but uses\n\
    \      semantically meaningful names while MARCXML uses the MARC codes.)\n   SRU:\
    \ Search/Retrieve via URL Response Format.  An XML schema for the\n      SRU response.\
    \  SRU is a protocol, and the media type sru+xml\n      pertains specifically\
    \ to the default SRU response.  The SRU\n      response may be supplied in any\
    \ of a number of suitable schemas,\n      RSS, ATOM, for example, and the client\
    \ identifies the desired\n      format in the request, hence the need for a media\
    \ type.  This\n      mechanism will be introduced in SRU 2.0; in previous versions\n\
    \      (that is, all versions to date; 2.0 is in development), all\n      responses\
    \ are supplied in the existing default format, so no media\n      type was necessary.\
    \  SRU 2.0 is being developed within the\n      Organization for the Advancement\
    \ of Structured Information\n      Standards (OASIS).\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   An XML resource does not in itself compromise\
    \ data security.\n   Applications that retrieve XML files over a network by means\
    \ of\n   dereferencing a Uniform Resource Identifier [RFC3986] are advised to\n\
    \   properly interpret the data so as to prevent unintended access.\n   Hence,\
    \ the security issues described in Section 7 of [RFC3986] apply.\n   Because the\
    \ media types described in this document use the \"+xml\"\n   convention, they\
    \ share the security considerations described in\n   Section 10 of [RFC3023].\n\
    \   In general, security issues related to the use of XML in IETF\n   protocols\
    \ are discussed in Section 7 of [RFC3470] also apply.  In the\n   following sections,\
    \ we review some aspects that are important for\n   document-centric XML as applied\
    \ to text encoding.\n"
- title: 8.1.  Harmful Content
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Harmful Content\n   Any application that retrieves the XML media types\
    \ described in this\n   specification needs to be aware of risks connected with\
    \ injection of\n   harmful scripts and executable XML (i.e., \"active content\"\
    \ as\n   described in [RFC4288]).  Although XML inclusion mechanisms and the\n\
    \   use of external entities can introduce vulnerabilities to various\n   forms\
    \ of spoofing and also reveal aspects of a service in a way that\n   may compromise\
    \ its security, such vulnerabilities are application\n   specific.  In any case,\
    \ MODS documents do not contain \"active\n   content\".\n"
- title: 8.2.  Authenticity and Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Authenticity and Confidentiality\n   Historical and bibliographical information\
    \ can often be encoded in\n   MODS documents, and such information might even\
    \ have legal force in\n   some jurisdictions.  Digitization and encoding of such\
    \ information\n   might require technologies for assuring authenticity, such as\n\
    \   cryptographic check sums and electronic signatures.  Similarly,\n   historical\
    \ documents might in part or in their entirety be\n   confidential.  Such confidentiality\
    \ might be required by law or by\n   the terms and conditions such as in the case\
    \ of donated or deposited\n   text from private sources.  A text archive might\
    \ need content\n   filtering or cryptographic technologies to meet such requirements.\n"
