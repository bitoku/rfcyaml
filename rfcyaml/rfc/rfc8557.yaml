  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"Deterministic Networking Use Cases\" [RFC8578] illustrates\
    \ that\n   beyond the classical case of Industrial Automation and Control\n  \
    \ Systems (IACSs) there are in fact multiple industries with strong,\n   and relatively\
    \ similar, needs for deterministic network services with\n   latency guarantees\
    \ and ultra-low packet loss.\n   The generalization of the needs for more deterministic\
    \ networks has\n   led to the IEEE 802.1 Audio Video Bridging (AVB) Task Group\
    \ becoming\n   the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) [IEEE-802.1TSNTG] Task Group\n\
    \   (TG), with a much-expanded constituency from the industrial and\n   vehicular\
    \ markets.\n   Along with this expansion, the networks considered here are becoming\n\
    \   larger and structured, requiring deterministic forwarding beyond the\n   LAN\
    \ boundaries.  For instance, an IACS segregates the network along\n   the broad\
    \ lines of the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture\n   (PERA) [ISA95], typically\
    \ using deterministic LANs for Purdue level 2\n   control systems, whereas public\
    \ infrastructures such as electricity\n   automation require deterministic properties\
    \ over the wide area.\n   Implementers have come to realize that the convergence\
    \ of IT and\n   Operation Technology (OT) networks requires Layer 3, as well as\n\
    \   Layer 2, capabilities.\n   While the initial user base has focused almost\
    \ entirely on Ethernet\n   physical media and Ethernet-based bridging protocols\
    \ from several\n   Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), the need for Layer\
    \ 3, as\n   expressed above, must not be confined to Ethernet and Ethernet-like\n\
    \   media.  While such media must be encompassed by any useful\n   Deterministic\
    \ Networking (DetNet) architecture, cooperation between\n   the IETF and other\
    \ SDOs must not be limited to the IEEE or the\n   IEEE 802 organizations.  Furthermore,\
    \ while both completed and\n   ongoing work in other SDOs, and in IEEE 802 in\
    \ particular, provides\n   an obvious starting point for a DetNet architecture,\
    \ we must not\n   assume that these other SDOs' work confines the space in which\
    \ the\n   DetNet architecture progresses.\n   The properties of deterministic\
    \ networks will have specific\n   requirements for the use of routed networks\
    \ to support these\n   applications, and a new model must be proposed to integrate\
    \ this\n   determinism in IT implementations.  The proposed model should enable\n\
    \   a fully scheduled operation orchestrated by a central controller and\n   may\
    \ support a more distributed operation with (probably lesser)\n   capabilities.\
    \  At any rate, the model should not compromise the\n   ability of a network to\
    \ keep carrying the sorts of traffic that is\n   already carried today in conjunction\
    \ with new, more deterministic\n   flows.  Note: \"Deterministic Networking Architecture\"\
    \ [DetNet-Arch]\n   was produced by the DetNet Working Group to describe that\
    \ model.\n   At the time of this writing, it is expected that\n   o  once the\
    \ abstract model is agreed upon, the IETF will specify\n      (1) the signaling\
    \ elements to be used to establish a path and\n      (2) the tagging elements\
    \ to be used to identify the flows that are\n      to be forwarded along that\
    \ path\n   o  the IETF will specify the necessary protocols or protocol\n    \
    \  additions, based on relevant IETF technologies, to implement the\n      selected\
    \ model\n   A desirable outcome of the work is the ability to establish a\n  \
    \ multi-hop path over the IP or MPLS network for a particular flow with\n   given\
    \ timing and precise throughput requirements and to carry this\n   particular\
    \ flow along the multi-hop path with such characteristics as\n   low latency and\
    \ ultra-low jitter, reordering and/or replication and\n   elimination of packets\
    \ over non-congruent paths for a higher delivery\n   ratio, and/or zero congestion\
    \ loss, regardless of the amount of other\n   flows in the network.\n   Depending\
    \ on the network capabilities and the current state, requests\n   to establish\
    \ a path by an end node or a network management entity may\n   be granted or rejected,\
    \ an existing path may be moved or removed, and\n   DetNet flows exceeding their\
    \ contract may face packet\n   declassification and drop.\n"
- title: 2.  On Deterministic Networking
  contents:
  - "2.  On Deterministic Networking\n   The Internet is not the only digital network\
    \ that has grown\n   dramatically over the last 30-40 years.  Video and audio\n\
    \   entertainment, as well as control systems for machinery,\n   manufacturing\
    \ processes, and vehicles, are also ubiquitous and are\n   now based almost entirely\
    \ on digital technologies.  Over the past\n   10 years, engineers in these fields\
    \ have come to realize that\n   significant advantages in both cost and the ability\
    \ to accelerate\n   growth can be obtained by basing all of these disparate digital\n\
    \   technologies on packet networks.\n   The goals of Deterministic Networking\
    \ are to (1) enable the migration\n   of applications with critical timing and\
    \ reliability issues that\n   currently use special-purpose fieldbus technologies\
    \ (High-Definition\n   Multimedia Interface (HDMI), Controller Area Network (CAN\
    \ bus),\n   PROFIBUS [PROFIBUS], etc. ... even RS-232!) to packet technologies\
    \ in\n   general and to IP in particular and (2) support both these new\n   applications\
    \ and existing packet network applications over the same\n   physical network.\
    \  In other words, a deterministic network is\n   backwards compatible with (capable\
    \ of transporting) statistically\n   multiplexed traffic while preserving the\
    \ properties of the accepted\n   deterministic flows.\n   [RFC8578] indicates\
    \ that applications in multiple fields need some or\n   all of a suite of features\
    \ that includes:\n   1.  Time synchronization of all host and network nodes (routers\n\
    \       and/or bridges), accurate to something between 10 nanoseconds and\n  \
    \     10 microseconds, depending on the application.\n   2.  Support for deterministic\
    \ packet flows that:\n       *  Can be unicast or multicast.\n       *  Need absolute\
    \ guarantees of minimum and maximum latency\n          end to end across the network;\
    \ sometimes a tight jitter is\n          required as well.\n       *  Need a packet\
    \ loss ratio beyond the classical range for a\n          particular medium, in\
    \ the range of 10^-9 to 10^-12 or better\n          on Ethernet and on the order\
    \ of 10^-5 in wireless sensor mesh\n          networks.\n       *  Can, in total,\
    \ absorb more than half of the network's\n          available bandwidth (that\
    \ is, massive over-provisioning is\n          ruled out as a solution).\n    \
    \   *  Cannot suffer throttling, congestion feedback, or any other\n         \
    \ network-imposed transmission delay, although the flows can be\n          meaningfully\
    \ characterized by either (1) a fixed, repeating\n          transmission schedule\
    \ or (2) a maximum bandwidth and packet\n          size.\n   3.  Multiple methods\
    \ for scheduling, shaping, limiting, and otherwise\n       controlling the transmission\
    \ of critical packets at each hop\n       through the network data plane.\n  \
    \ 4.  Robust defenses against misbehaving hosts, routers, or bridges,\n      \
    \ in both the data plane and the control plane, with guarantees\n       that a\
    \ critical flow within its guaranteed resources cannot be\n       affected by\
    \ other flows, whatever the pressures on the network.\n       For more on the\
    \ specific threats against DetNet, see\n       \"Deterministic Networking (DetNet)\
    \ Security Considerations\"\n       [DetNet-Security].\n   5.  One or more methods\
    \ for reserving resources in bridges and\n       routers to carry these flows.\n\
    \   Time-synchronization techniques need not be addressed by an IETF\n   working\
    \ group; there are a number of standards available for this\n   purpose, including\
    \ IEEE 1588 [IEEE-1588], IEEE 802.1AS [IEEE-8021AS],\n   and more.\n   The needs\
    \ related to multicast, latency, loss ratio, and throttling\n   avoidance exist\
    \ because the algorithms employed by the applications\n   demand it.  They are\
    \ not simply the transliteration of fieldbus needs\n   to a packet-based fieldbus\
    \ simulation; they also reflect fundamental\n   mathematics of the control of\
    \ a physical system.\n   With classical forwarding of latency-sensitive and loss-sensitive\n\
    \   packets across a network, interactions among different critical flows\n  \
    \ introduce fundamental uncertainties in delivery schedules.  The\n   details\
    \ of the queuing, shaping, and scheduling algorithms employed\n   by each bridge\
    \ or router to control the output sequence on a given\n   port affect the detailed\
    \ makeup of the output stream, e.g., how\n   finely a given flow's packets are\
    \ mixed among those of other flows.\n   This, in turn, has a strong effect on\
    \ the buffer requirements, and\n   hence the latency guarantees deliverable, by\
    \ the next bridge or\n   router along the path.  For this reason, the IEEE 802.1\
    \ TSN TG has\n   defined a new set of queuing, shaping, and scheduling algorithms\
    \ that\n   enable each bridge or router to compute the exact number of buffers\n\
    \   to be allocated for each flow or class of flows.\n   Networking protocols\
    \ commonly need robustness.  Note that robustness\n   plays a particularly important\
    \ part in real-time control networks,\n   where expensive equipment, and even\
    \ lives, can be lost due to\n   misbehaving equipment.\n   Reserving resources\
    \ before packet transmission is the one fundamental\n   shift in the behavior\
    \ of network applications that is impossible to\n   avoid.  In the first place,\
    \ a network cannot deliver finite latency\n   and practically zero packet loss\
    \ to an arbitrarily high offered load.\n   Secondly, achieving practically zero\
    \ packet loss for unthrottled\n   (though bandwidth-limited) flows means that\
    \ bridges and routers have\n   to dedicate buffer resources to specific flows\
    \ or classes of flows.\n   The requirements of each reservation have to be translated\
    \ into the\n   parameters that control each host's, bridge's, and router's queuing,\n\
    \   shaping, and scheduling functions and delivered to the hosts,\n   bridges,\
    \ and routers.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Supported Topologies
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Supported Topologies\n   In some use cases, the end point that runs the\
    \ application is\n   involved in the Deterministic Networking operation -- for\
    \ instance,\n   by controlling certain aspects of its throughput, such as rate\
    \ or\n   precise time of emission.  In such a case, the deterministic path is\n\
    \   end to end from application host to application host.\n   On the other end,\
    \ the deterministic portion of a path may be a tunnel\n   between an ingress point\
    \ and an egress router.  In any case, routers\n   and switches in between should\
    \ not need to be aware of whether the\n   path is end to end or a tunnel.\n  \
    \ While it is clear that DetNet does not aim to set up deterministic\n   paths\
    \ over the global Internet, there is still a lack of clarity\n   regarding the\
    \ limits of a domain where a deterministic path can be\n   set up.  These limits\
    \ may depend on the technology that is used to\n   set the path up, whether it\
    \ is centralized or distributed.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Flow Characterization
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Flow Characterization\n   Deterministic forwarding can only apply to flows\
    \ with such\n   well-defined characteristics as periodicity and burstiness.  Before\
    \ a\n   path can be established to serve them, the expression of those\n   characteristics,\
    \ and how the network can serve them (for instance, in\n   shaping and forwarding\
    \ operations), must be specified.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Centralized Path Computation and Installation
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Centralized Path Computation and Installation\n   A centralized routing\
    \ model, such as that provided with a Path\n   Computation Element (PCE) (see\
    \ [RFC4655]), enables global and\n   per-flow optimizations.  This type of model\
    \ is attractive, but a\n   number of issues remain to be solved -- in particular:\n\
    \   o  whether and how the path computation can be installed by\n      *  an end\
    \ device or\n      *  a network management entity\n      and\n   o  how the path\
    \ is set up -- either\n      *  by installing state at each hop with a direct\
    \ interaction\n         between the forwarding device and the PCE or\n      *\
    \  along a path by injecting a source-routed request at one end of\n         the\
    \ path, following classical Traffic Engineering (TE) models\n   To enable a centralized\
    \ model, DetNet should produce a description of\n   the high-level interaction\
    \ and data models to:\n   o  report the topology and device capabilities to the\
    \ central\n      controller\n   o  establish a direct interface between the centralized\
    \ PCE and each\n      device under its control in order to enable vertical signaling\n\
    \   o  request a path setup for a new flow with particular\n      characteristics\
    \ over the service interface and control it through\n      its life cycle\n  \
    \ o  provide support for life-cycle management for a path\n      (instantiate/modify/update/delete)\n\
    \   o  provide support for adaptability to cope with such various events\n   \
    \   as loss of a link\n   o  expose the status of the path to the end devices\
    \ (User-Network\n      Interfaces (UNIs))\n   o  provide additional reliability\
    \ through redundancy, particularly\n      with Packet Replication, Elimination,\
    \ and Ordering Functions\n      (PREOF), where redundant paths may deliver packets\
    \ out of order\n      and PREOF may need to correct the ordering\n   o  indicate\
    \ the flows and packet sequences in-band with the flows.\n      This is needed\
    \ for flows that require PREOF in order to isolate\n      duplicates and reorder\
    \ packets at the end of the sequence\n"
- title: 3.4.  Distributed Path Setup
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Distributed Path Setup\n   Whether a distributed alternative without a\
    \ PCE can be valuable could\n   be studied as well.  Such an alternative could,\
    \ for instance, build\n   upon Resource Reservation Protocol - TE (RSVP-TE) flows\
    \ [RFC3209].\n   But the focus of the work should be to deliver the centralized\n\
    \   approach first.\n   To enable functionality similar to that of RSVP-TE, the\
    \ following\n   steps would take place:\n   1.  Neighbors and their capabilities\
    \ would be discovered and exposed\n       to compute a path that would fit the\
    \ DetNet constraints --\n       typically those of latency, time precision, and\
    \ resource\n       availability.\n   2.  A constrained path would be calculated\
    \ with an improved version\n       of Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) that\
    \ is aware of\n       DetNet.\n   3.  The path may be installed using a control\
    \ protocol such as\n       RSVP-TE, extended to enable flow identification and\
    \ install new\n       per-hop behavior such as Packet Replication, Elimination,\
    \ and\n       Ordering, and to reserve physical resources for the flow.  In\n\
    \       that case, traffic flows could be transported through an MPLS-TE\n   \
    \    tunnel, using the reserved resources for this flow at each hop.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Duplicated Data Format
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Duplicated Data Format\n   In some cases, the duplication and elimination\
    \ of packets over\n   non-congruent paths are required to achieve a sufficiently\
    \ high\n   delivery ratio to meet application needs.  In these cases, a small\n\
    \   number of packet formats and supporting protocols are required\n   (preferably\
    \ just one of each) to serialize the packets of a DetNet\n   stream at one point\
    \ in the network, replicate them at one or more\n   points in the network, and\
    \ discard duplicates at one or more other\n   points in the network, including\
    \ perhaps the destination host.  Using\n   an existing solution would be preferable\
    \ to inventing a new one.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Security in the context of Deterministic Networking\
    \ has an added\n   dimension; the time of delivery of a packet can be just as\
    \ important\n   as the contents of the packet itself.  A man-in-the-middle attack,\n\
    \   for example, can impose and then systematically adjust additional\n   delays\
    \ into a link, and thus disrupt or subvert a real-time\n   application without\
    \ having to crack any encryption methods employed.\n   See [RFC7384] for an exploration\
    \ of this issue in a related context.\n   Typical control networks today rely\
    \ on complete physical isolation to\n   prevent rogue access to network resources.\
    \  DetNet enables the\n   virtualization of those networks over a converged IT/OT\n\
    \   infrastructure.  Doing so, DetNet introduces an additional risk of\n   flows\
    \ interacting and interfering with one another as they share\n   physical resources\
    \ such as Ethernet trunks and the radio spectrum.\n   The requirement is that\
    \ there is no possible data leak from and into\n   a deterministic flow.  Stated\
    \ more generally, there is no possible\n   influence whatsoever from the outside\
    \ on a deterministic flow.  The\n   expectation is that physical resources are\
    \ effectively associated\n   with a given flow at a given point in time.  In that\
    \ model, the\n   time-sharing of physical resources becomes transparent to the\n\
    \   individual flows, as these flows have no clue regarding whether or\n   not\
    \ the resources are used by other flows at other times.\n   The overall security\
    \ of a deterministic system must cover:\n   o  the protection of the signaling\
    \ protocol\n   o  the authentication and authorization of the controlling nodes,\n\
    \      including plug-and-play participating end systems\n   o  the identification\
    \ and shaping of the flows\n   o  the isolation of flows from leakage and other\
    \ influences from any\n      activity sharing physical resources\n   The specific\
    \ threats against DetNet are further discussed in\n   [DetNet-Security].\n"
