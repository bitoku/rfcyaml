  - "               REAL-TIME DATA TRANSMISSION ON THE ARPANET\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\
    \   The ARPA Network is rapidly proving to be a useful tool in computer\n   communications\
    \ and resource sharing.  It has been proposed that the\n   same network might\
    \ also be able to support real-time processes such\n   as audio or video communications\
    \ for conferencing purposes.  The\n   degree of support of these types of processes\
    \ will largely be\n   determined by transmission bit-rates and delays.\n   The\
    \ IMP subnetwork throughput rates (one way) average about 37\n   kilobits[1],\
    \ therefore an external process must operate at a bit-rate\n   below that level.\
    \  This would imply some form of data compression for\n   both audio and video\
    \ transmission.  Research in these areas is still\n   in progress so these processes\
    \ must be simulated at the present time.\n   In addition to bit-rate, system response\
    \ time (system delay) is an\n   important factor since this has direct influence\
    \ on the amount of\n   data which must be buffered in order to keep a real-time\
    \ process\n   running without discontinuities or gaps.  Such delays may be caused\n\
    \   by network loading, host loading, or an excessive number of IMP-to-\n   IMP\
    \ hops in the transmission path.\n   In order to get a feel for the ability of\
    \ the network to support a\n   real-time process an experiment was conducted with\
    \ real-time data\n   being sent from the UCSB SEL810-B computer, by way of the\
    \ UCSB IBM\n   360 host, onto the ARPA Network and into a host discard socket\
    \ in the\n   UCLA IBM 360 computer.  This particular data path very nearly\n \
    \  duplicates the path which might be taken if real-time devices were\n   attached\
    \ to large scale host computers operating in their normal mode\n   (usually timesharing).\
    \  The experiment consisted of measuring the\n   duration of gaps incurred at\
    \ various process bit-rates, and buffer\n   sizes ranging from one to eight network\
    \ packets.\n   Earlier experiments at MIT[2] simulated vocoded speech transmission\n\
    \   over the ARPA Network using the TX-2 computer and \"Fake host 3\" in a\n \
    \  destination IMP.  Speech was sampled by the TX-2 and simulated speech\n   data\
    \ blocks were sent to a particular fake host.  Receipt of an\n   acknowledgment\
    \ by TX-2 indicated that the corresponding blocks of\n   speech data could be\
    \ reconstituted.  Experiments were conducted with\n   bit-rates from 2400-17000\
    \ bps and varying block sizes (depending on\n   the number of hops), and conclusions\
    \ were reached that with delay\n   characteristics similar to a lightly loaded\
    \ ARPA Network speech\n   communications could be satisfactory from a human-factors\
    \ standpoint.\nII.  CONFIGURATION\n   Data for this experiment originated in an\
    \ SEL 810-B computer located\n   in the Electrical Engineering Department at UCSB.\
    \  This 70ns cycle\n   time computer is the heart of an interactive signal processing\
    \ system\n   developed by Retz[3].  It has associated hardware such as a card\n\
    \   reader, two IBM 1311 disk drives, a drum storage unit, A/D and D/A\n   converters,\
    \ Teletype, Tektronix 611 storage display unit, OLS\n   keyboard, and a connection\
    \ to an IBM 1800 computer.  This system is\n   linked to the UCSB IBM 360/75 via\
    \ a 500 kilobit line for high speed\n   data transfers.  Software in both the\
    \ SEL 810-B and the IBM 360\n   enables the SEL to communicate with the ARPA Network.\n\
    \   The hardware configuration of the data path between the SEL 810-B and\n  \
    \ UCLA is shown in Figure 1.  For simulating speech transmission, the\n   SEL\
    \ is thought of as a \"speech processor\", analyzing and encoding the\n   one-way\
    \ conversation of a person at UCSB talking to someone at UCLA.\n   The fact that\
    \ there was no \"speech processor\" at UCLA probably had\n   little or no effect\
    \ on the measurements that were made.  This is\n   substantiated by noting that\
    \ the SEL was a dedicated processor that\n   did not introduce delays and if a\
    \ similar dedicated processor was\n   attached to the host computer at UCLA it\
    \ probably would not have\n   caused delays either.  However, the UCLA host merely\
    \ discarded the\n   data it received, thereby going through fewer steps than if\
    \ an\n   external processor was attached, and so our simulation was not exact.\n\
    \   A configuration such as that of Figure 1 did yield information about\n   host-to-host\
    \ transmission, since the SEL was essentially a zero-delay\n   data generator.\
    \  If real-time processors are to access the ARPA\n   Network through large-scale\
    \ time-shared host computers then host-to-\n   host transmission rate and delay\
    \ are important measurements.  In this\n   configuration we can expect the host\
    \ computers to be the primary\n   bottlenecks in the data path.\n            \

    \ path used\n                           for sending real-time data from the\n\
    \                           SEL 810-B to the UCLA host discard socket.\n   The\
    \ host response time to requests from the external processor or the\n   Network\
    \ will be a function of type of host computer (IBM, DEC,\n   UNIVAC, etc.), job\
    \ load, and priorities given to both the Network and\n   the external processor.\
    \  If host computers cannot provide the\n   necessary throughput and necessary\
    \ response times, then real-time\n   devices may have to connect directly to IMPs\
    \ (assuming the Network\n   can properly support these devices).\nIII.  SOFTWARE\n\
    \   The standard NCP software was used in both host computers.  Several\n   custom\
    \ programs were required in the UCSB computers in order to\n   transfer the data\
    \ and make measurements.  These can be divided into\n   three categories:\n  \
    \    1) I/O Programs.\n      Routines were written for both the IBM 360 and the\
    \ SEL to handle\n      the transfer of data between the two computers and to enable\
    \ the\n      SEL to send an \"attention interrupt\" to the IBM 360.  These\n \
    \     programs form the software part of the SEL/360 high-speed data\n      link\
    \ and are necessary for any communication between the two\n      computers.\n\
    \      2) Network Communications Programs\n      A protocol was developed which\
    \ enabled the SEL to communicate to\n      the 360 the desired Network connections\
    \ to be made or broken, and\n      the desired transfer of data across these connections.\
    \  This\n      protocol was implemented for each computer using the above I/O\n\
    \      routines.\n      3) Measurement Control Program\n      This assembly language\
    \ program caused the SEL to push data towards\n      the receiving host (UCLA)\
    \ at a specified SEL process bit-rate.\n      The program was also responsible\
    \ for detecting and measuring the\n      duration of any gaps introduced in the\
    \ process.\nIV.  METHOD\n   Within the SEL two buffers, each of 1 to 8 network\
    \ packets in length,\n   are first loaded with alternating bit patterns in consecutive\
    \ 16-bit\n   words.  A conversion process is then initiated on one of the buffers\n\
    \   at a sampling frequency necessary to give the desired bit-rate.\n   Since\
    \ data is being sent out to a destination host we would expect\n   the buffers\
    \ to be filled by an analog-to-digital conversion process.\n   However, in this\
    \ experiment, the process of digital-to-analog\n   conversion is used instead\
    \ so that we can listen to the alternating\n   bit patterns as a steady tone while\
    \ still simulating an A-to-D\n   process.\n   When a buffer is filled (played\
    \ out) a \"write\" operation is initiated\n   to send that buffer to UCLA.  The\
    \ next buffer is then tested to see\n   if the previous \"write\" has been completed,\
    \ i.e. the buffer is empty.\n   If the next buffer is empty the process continues\
    \ normally.  If the\n   next buffer is not empty it means that one of the computers\
    \ on the\n   Network has not taken the data fast enough, therefore a gap has been\n\
    \   introduced in the real-time process.  At this point the D-to-A\n   converter\
    \ is shut off resulting in an audible break in the tone that\n   is being played\
    \ out.  A timer is also started to test for the empty\n   buffer every one millisecond\
    \ and to measure the duration of the gap.\n   When the next buffer is finally\
    \ emptied the D-to-A process is resumed\n   and the gap data recorded in a table.\n\
    V. PROCEDURE\n   A connection to the UCLA host discard socket was first established\n\
    \   using the network communications programs.  Every test from this\n   point\
    \ on required a repetition of the following steps.\n      1) Initialize the UCSB\
    \ IBM 360 for double buffered data transfers\n         using specified buffer\
    \ sizes.\n      2) Initialize the SEL measurement control program with the proper\n\
    \         buffer size and process bit-rate.\n      3) Start the test.  A constant\
    \ tone from the speaker indicates\n         that the process is being properly\
    \ maintained.  Gaps in the\n         tone indicate gaps in the process.\n    \
    \  4) After 30 seconds, stop the test.\n      5) Examine the gap table to determine\
    \ the number of gaps, the\n         duration of each gap, and the average duration.\n\
    \   The entire procedure was carried out from the SEL end using the\n   interactive\
    \ On-Line System.  The timing interval of 30 seconds was\n   measured with a sweep\
    \ second hand of a watch and the test was started\n   and stopped manually.  All\
    \ tests were conducted during prime time to\n   obtain typical loading conditions.\n\
    VI.  RESULTS\n   A total of 179 tests were conducted.  Of these, 176 were 30 second\n\
    \   tests and three were long duration tests.  Table I contains the\n   results\
    \ of the 30 second tests.  Buffer sizes were varied from one to\n   eight Network\
    \ packets and for each buffer setting 22 different\n   process bit-rates (usually\
    \ in increments of 1200 bps) were attempted.\n   These measurements were performed\
    \ over a period of three days during\n   prime time.\n   Those test conditions\
    \ which were successful contain only two items of\n   information in Table I:\
    \ time of day and number of buffers\n   transmitted.  All but seven of the tests\
    \ were successful.  The tests\n   which were unsuccessful, i.e. experienced gaps,\
    \ are those entries in\n   Table I which contain additional information such as\
    \ number of gaps,\n   and maximum, average and minimum gap duration.\n   An examination\
    \ of those tests which failed shows that the longest gap\n   which occurred was\
    \ 8 seconds in duration.  There were three other\n   significant failures between\
    \ 9:52 A.M. and 9:59 A.M. on 2/7/73.\n   There are strong indications that it\
    \ was the UCSB 360 that caused\n   these gaps to occur.  This conclusion is based\
    \ upon the fact that the\n   Electrical Engineering On-Line classroom (16 interactive\
    \ graphics\n   terminals) was in full use that day until 10:00 A.M. and the SEL\n\
    \   connection to the IBM 360 has lower priority in the 360 than the UCSB\n  \
    \ On-Line System.  The remaining three tests which failed did not do so\n   at\
    \ any regular time, bit-rate, or buffer size so no definite\n   statements can\
    \ be made about their source of delay.\n   The overall picture presented by Table\
    \ I is very promising.  In 96\n   percent of the trials a communications link\
    \ of the two host computers\n   and a portion of the ARPA Network was able to\
    \ take data from a real-\n   time process operating as high as 30,000 bits/second.\
    \  Further\n   encouragement is given by three additional tests which were carried\n\
    \   out at 30,000 bps and a buffer size of 2,016 bits.  On 2/5/73 at 2:20\n  \
    \ P.M. a 5-minute test was executed with no gaps.  On 2/6/73 at 11:58\n   A.M.\
    \ the same test was executed for 8 minutes with no gaps.  The\n   third test was\
    \ conducted for 18 minutes on 2/7/73 at 11:53 A.M. with\n   no gaps in the process.\n\
    \   The tests were not carried out often enough or over a long enough\n   period\
    \ of time to obtain any statistical results or predictions. The\n   measurement\
    \ task is made somewhat difficult by the fact that the\n   state of the overall\
    \ communications link is never repeatable from one\n   test to the next. For example,\
    \ it was found that a test which failed\n   could usually be repeated successfully,\
    \ even when it was carried out\n   within 15 seconds of the previous test.\n+-----+---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\

    \ CONCLUSIONS\n   Based upon the results of this experiment the following conclusions\n\
    \   can be drawn:\n      1) High bit-rate real-time processes can use the ARPA\
    \ Network to\n         transmit data for relatively long periods of time.\n  \
    \    2) Real-time processes accessing the Network through large-scale\n      \
    \   timesharing host computers can expect arbitrary delays or gaps,\n        \
    \ probably attributable to the host computers and not the\n         Network.\n\
    \      3) Techniques for handling gaps of 1/2 to 1 second may be possible\n  \
    \       but 8 second gaps, as measured in this experiment, will cause\n      \
    \   extreme hardship on any real-time process.\n   This experiment has pointed\
    \ up the need to conduct additional tests\n   using a complete transmission link\
    \ with actual data and with\n   monitoring equipment at both the sending and receiving\
    \ ends. Our\n   current and future efforts are directed toward carrying out such\n\
    \   experiments.\nREFERENCES\n[1]  \"Interface Message Processors for the ARPA\
