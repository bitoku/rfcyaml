- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines an extension to the Atom Syndication\
    \ Format\n   that can be used to add links to Atom feed or entry documents\n \
    \  referencing resources that describe the explicit rights that have\n   been\
    \ granted to consumers of those documents.\n   Describing licenses using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in this\n   specification is currently considered to be largely experimental.\n\
    \   While it is a common practice for feed publishers to associate\n   licenses\
    \ with syndicated content, there are still very few feed\n   consumers that utilize\
    \ such metadata, and the effectiveness of doing\n   so is still largely unknown.\
    \  As it is not yet certain how these\n   mechanisms will be used, implementations\
    \ and feedback are encouraged.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Notational Conventions
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in BCP 14, [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   The term \"link relation\" refers to the value of the Atom\
    \ link\n   elements rel attribute as defined in Section 4.2.7.2 of [RFC4287].\n\
    \   The term \"license\" refers to a potentially machine-readable\n   description\
    \ of explicit rights that have been granted to consumers of\n   an Atom feed or\
    \ entry.  Rights granted by a license may be associated\n   with obligations that\
    \ must be assumed by those exercising those\n   rights.\n   Atom allows the use\
    \ of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)\n   [RFC3987].  Every URI [RFC3986]\
    \ is also an IRI, so a URI may be used\n   wherever below an IRI is named.  When\
    \ an IRI that is not also a URI\n   is given for dereferencing, it MUST be mapped\
    \ to a URI using the\n   steps in Section 3.1 of [RFC3987].\n   Atom allows the\
    \ use of the xml:base attribute [W3C.REC-xmlbase-\n   20010627] to establish the\
    \ base URI (or IRI) used to resolve any\n   relative references as described in\
    \ Section 5.1.1 of [RFC3986].\n   Atom allows the use of the xml:lang attribute\
    \ to indicate the natural\n   language of an element, its attributes, and its\
    \ descendents.  The\n   language context is only significant for elements and\
    \ attributes\n   declared to be \"Language-Sensitive\" as described in [RFC4287].\
    \  The\n   title attribute of the atom:link element is defined as being\n   Language-Sensitive.\n"
- title: 2.  The "license" Link Relation
  contents:
  - "2.  The \"license\" Link Relation\n   The \"license\" link relation can be used\
    \ to associate licenses with a\n   feed or entry.\n   Feed and entry elements\
    \ MAY contain any number of \"license\" link\n   relations but MUST NOT contain\
    \ more than one with the same\n   combination of href and type attribute values.\
    \  The IRI specified by\n   the link's href attribute SHOULD be dereferenceable\
    \ to return a\n   representation of the license.  The license representation MAY\
    \ be\n   machine readable.\n   Feeds and entries can be dual-licensed by including\
    \ multiple\n   \"license\" link relations specifying different href attribute\
    \ values.\n   If multiple \"license\" link relations are specified, each SHOULD\n\
    \   contain a title attribute specifying a human-readable label for the\n   license.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Unspecified License Links
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Unspecified License Links\n   A publisher can use an \"unspecified license\
    \ link\" (a \"license\" link\n   relation with an href attribute value equal to\n\
    \   \"http://purl.org/atompub/license#unspecified\") to indicate that a\n   feed\
    \ or license has not been explicitly linked to a license\n   description.\n  \
    \ A feed or entry containing an unspecified license link MUST NOT\n   contain\
    \ any other \"license\" link relations.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Comparing License Links
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Comparing License Links\n   Atom implementations that are capable of supporting\
    \ \"license\" links\n   SHOULD use the simple string-comparison method described\
    \ in\n   [RFC3987], Section 5.3.1, to determine whether multiple \"license\"\n\
    \   links are equivalent.  The other comparison methods discussed in\n   Section\
    \ 5.1 of the IRI specification MAY be used.  If the \"license\"\n   link is specified\
    \ using a relative reference, it MUST be converted to\n   its fully qualified\
    \ form before comparison.\n"

- title: 2.4.  Inherited Licenses
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Inherited Licenses\n   \"License\" links specified within atom:feed or\
    \ atom:source elements\n   are inherited by entries.  Generally, a more specific\
    \ license\n   overrides a less specific license.  More specifically, if an\n \
    \  atom:entry has any \"license\" link relations, including the\n   \"undefined\"\
    \ license, it does not inherit any license from a\n   containing atom:feed element\
    \ or contained atom:source element.  If an\n   entry has no \"license\" link relations,\
    \ and contains an atom:source\n   element, it inherits licenses from the atom:source.\
    \  If the\n   atom:source element contains no \"license\" links, or if the entry\
    \ does\n   not have an atom:source element, the entry inherits licenses from the\n\
    \   containing atom:feed.\n   An entry's license MAY be inherited by media resources\
    \ associated\n   with the entry.  Some media types have ways of including license\n\
    \   information, which always overrides the entry's licensing.\n   An agent searching\
    \ to find entries that fall under a specific license\n   (e.g. a search for entries\
    \ containing pictures and the word\n   \"knitting\" where the entry is under any\
    \ Creative Commons license)\n   MUST check the most granular license definition\
    \ available, rather\n   than assume license inheritance without checking.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Relationship with the atom:rights Element
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Relationship with the atom:rights Element\n   \"License\" link relations\
    \ are related to the atom:rights element in\n   that both are intended to communicate\
    \ information about the rights\n   associated with an Atom document.  Where the\
    \ two differ, however, is\n   in the fact that atom:rights is intended strictly\
    \ as a human-\n   readable assertion of rights held over a work while the \"license\"\
    \n   link relation is intended to provide a potentially machine-readable\n   description\
    \ of what rights have been granted to others.  The two\n   constructs may overlap\
    \ one another and conflicts could arise if they\n   are contradictory.  It is\
    \ important that publishers of Atom documents\n   ensure that the atom:rights\
    \ and \"license\" link relations are\n   consistent with one another.\n   If an\
    \ atom:entry that does not contain an atom:source is copied from\n   one feed\
    \ into another feed, then if the feed into which it is copied\n   contains a license,\
    \ an atom:source element SHOULD be added to the\n   copied entry.  If a source\
    \ feed contains a license, that license\n   SHOULD be preserved in an atom:source\
    \ element added to any entries\n   copied from the source feed that do not already\
    \ contain atom:source\n   elements.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   When \"license\" link relations are used in Atom\
    \ documents, the\n   security considerations specified in [RFC4287] Section 8\
    \ apply.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification defines one new Atom link relation\
    \ type to be\n   registered in the IANA Registry of Link Relations as defined\
    \ by\n   [RFC4287].\n       Attribute Value: license\n       Description: Specifies\
    \ the IRI of a license associated with\n                    the containing feed,\
    \ entry, or source element.\n       Expected display characteristics: None\n \
    \      Security considerations: When \"license\" link relations are used\n   \
    \                 in Atom documents, the security considerations for\n       \
    \             handling links in Atom documents apply.\n"
