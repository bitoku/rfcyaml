  - "1.  Introduction\n   Delivery of mail messages to the final mail drop is not\
    \ always done\n   by direct IP communication between the submitter and final receiver,\n\
    \   and there may be some intermediate hosts that relay the messages.  So\n  \
    \ it is difficult to know at message submission (also at receiver side)\n   that\
    \ all intermediate relay hosts are properly configured.  It is not\n   easy to\
    \ configure all systems consistently since the DNS\n   configuration used by mail\
    \ message delivery systems is more complex\n   than other Internet services. \
    \ During the transition period from IPv4\n   to IPv6, more care should be applied\
    \ to IPv4/v6 interoperability.\n   This document talks about SMTP operational\
    \ experiences in IPv4/v6\n   dual stack environments.  As IPv6-capable SMTP servers\
    \ are deployed,\n   it has become apparent that certain configurations of MX records\
    \ are\n   necessary for stable dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) SMTP operation.\n  \
    \ This document does not discuss the problems encountered when the\n   sending\
    \ MTA and the receiving MTA have no common protocol (e.g., the\n   sending MTA\
    \ is IPv4-only while the receiving MTA is IPv6-only).  Such\n   a situation can\
    \ be resolved by making either side dual-stack or by\n   making either side use\
    \ a protocol translator (see Appendix A on\n   issues with protocol translator).\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Basic DNS Resource Record Definitions for Mail Routing\n   Mail messages\
    \ on the Internet are typically delivered based on the\n   Domain Name System\
    \ [Mockapetris].  MX RRs are looked up in DNS to\n   retrieve the names of hosts\
    \ running MTAs associated with the domain\n   part of the mail address.  DNS lookup\
    \ uses IN class for both IPv4 and\n   IPv6, and similarly IN MX records will be\
    \ used for mail routing for\n   both IPv4 and IPv6.  Hosts which have IPv6 connectivity\
    \ and also want\n   to have the mails delivered using IPv6 must define IPv6 addresses\
    \ for\n   the host name as well as IPv4 addresses [Thomson].\n   An MX RR has\
    \ two parameters, a preference value and the name of\n   destination host.  The\
    \ name of the destination host will be used to\n   look up an IP address to initiate\
    \ an SMTP connection [Partridge].\n   For example, an IPv6-only site may have\
    \ the following DNS\n   definitions:\n      example.org.            IN MX   1\
    \  mx1.example.org.\n                              IN MX   10 mx10.example.org.\n\
    \      mx1.example.org.        IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::1\n      mx10.example.org.\
    \       IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::2\n   In the transition period from IPv4 to IPv6,\
    \ there are many IPv4-only\n   sites, and such sites will not have mail interoperability\
    \ with IPv6-\n   only sites.  For the transition period, all mail domains should\
    \ have\n   MX records such that MX targets with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses exist,\n\
    \   e.g.,\n      example.org.            IN MX   1  mx1.example.org.\n       \
    \                       IN MX   10 mx10.example.org.\n      mx1.example.org. \
    \       IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::1\n                              IN A    192.0.2.1\n\
    \      mx10.example.org.       IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::2\n                    \
    \          IN A    192.0.2.2\n   But, not every MX target may support dual-stack\
    \ operation.  Some host\n   entries may have only A RRs or AAAA RRs:\n      example.org.\
    \            IN MX   1  mx1.example.org.\n                              IN MX\
    \   10 mx10.example.org.\n      mx1.example.org.        IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::1\n\
    \      mx10.example.org.       IN A    192.0.2.1\n   The following sections discuss\
    \ how the sender side should operate\n   with IPv4/v6 combined RRs (section 3),\
    \ and how the receiver should\n   define RRs to maintain interoperability between\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6\n   networks (section 4).\n"

  - "3.  SMTP Sender Algorithm in a Dual-Stack Environment\n   In a dual-stack environment,\
    \ MX records for a domain resemble the\n   following:\n      example.org.    \
    \        IN MX   1  mx1.example.org.\n                              IN MX   10\

    \       IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::2 ; IPv6-only\n   For a single MX record, there\
    \ are multiple possible final states,\n   including: (a) one or more A records\
    \ for the IPv4 destination, (b)\n   one or more AAAA records for the IPv6 destination,\
    \ (c) a mixture of A\n   and AAAA records.  Because multiple MX records may be\
    \ defined using\n   different preference values, multiple addresses must be traversed\n\
    \   based on multiple MXs.  Domains without MX records and failure\n   recovery\
    \ cases must be handled properly as well.\n   The algorithm for a dual-stack SMTP\
    \ sender is basically the same as\n   that for an IPv4-only sender, but it now\
    \ includes AAAA lookups of MX\n   records for SMTP-over-IPv6 delivery.  IPv4/v6\
    \ dual stack destinations\n   should be treated just like multihomed destinations,\
    \ as described in\n   RFC 2821 [Klensin], section 5.  When there is no destination\
    \ address\n   record found (i.e., the sender MTA is IPv4-only and there are no\
    \ A\n   records available), the case should be treated just like MX records\n\
    \   without address records, and deliveries should fail.\n      ; if the sender\
    \ MTA is IPv4-only, email delivery to a.example.org\n      ; should fail with\
    \ the same error as deliveries to b.example.org.\n      a.example.org.       \
    \   IN MX   1  mx1.a.example.org.\n      mx1.a.example.org.      IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::1\
    \ ; IPv6-only\n      b.example.org.          IN MX   1  mx1.b.example.org. ; no\
    \ address\n   An algorithm for a dual-stack SMTP sender is as follows:\n   (1)\
    \  Lookup the MX record for the destination domain.  If a CNAME\n        record\
    \ is returned, go to the top of step (1) with replacing the\n        destination\
    \ domain by the query's result.  If any MX records are\n        returned, go to\
    \ step (2) with the query's result (explicit MX).\n        If NODATA (i.e., empty\
    \ answer with NOERROR(0) RCODE) is\n        returned, there is no MX record but\
    \ the name is valid.  Assume\n        that there is a record like \"name.  IN\
    \ MX 0 name.\" (implicit MX)\n        and go to step (3).  If HOST_NOT_FOUND (i.e.,\
    \ empty answer with\n        NXDOMAIN(3) RCODE) is returned, there is no such\
    \ domain.  Raise\n        a permanent email delivery failure.  Finish.  If SERVFAIL\
    \ is\n        returned, retry after a certain period of time.\n   (2)  Compare\
    \ each host name in MX records with the names of the\n        sending host.  If\
    \ there is match, drop MX records which have an\n        equal or larger value\
    \ than the lowest-preference matching MX\n        record (including itself). \
    \ If multiple MX records remain, sort\n        the MX records in ascending order\
    \ based on their preference\n        values.  Loop over steps (3) to (9) on each\
    \ host name in MX\n        records in a sequence.  If no MX records remain, the\
    \ sending\n        host must be the primary MX host.  Other routing rules should\
    \ be\n        applied.  Finish.\n   (3)  If the sending MTA has IPv4 capability,\
    \ lookup the A records.\n        Keep the resulting addresses until step (5).\n\
    \   (4)  If the sending MTA has IPv6 capability, lookup the AAAA records.\n  \
    \      NOTE: IPv6 addresses for hosts defined by MX records may be\n        informed\
    \ in an additional information section of the DNS\n        queries' result as\
    \ well as IPv4 addresses.  If there is no\n        additional address information\
    \ for the MX hosts, separate\n        queries for A or AAAA records should be\
    \ sent.  There is no way\n        to query A and AAAA records at once in current\
    \ DNS\n        implementation.\n   (5)  If there is no A and no AAAA record present,\
    \ try the next MX\n        record (go to step (3)).  Note that the next MX record\
    \ could\n        have the same preference.\n        NOTE: If one or more address\
    \ records are found, an\n        implementation may sort addresses based on the\
    \ implementation's\n        preference of A or AAAA records.  To encourage the\
    \ transition\n        from IPv4 SMTP to IPv6 SMTP, AAAA records should take\n\
    \        precedence.  The sorting may only reorder addresses from MX\n       \
    \ records of the same preference.  RFC 2821 section 5 paragraph 4\n        suggests\
    \ randomization of destination addresses.  Randomization\n        should only\
    \ happen among A records, and among AAAA records (do\n        not mix A and AAAA\
    \ records).\n   (6)  For each of the addresses, loop over steps (7) to (9).\n\
    \   (7)  Try to make a TCP connection to the destination's SMTP port\n       \
    \ (25).  The client needs to follow timeouts documented in RFC\n        2821 section\
    \ 4.5.3.2.  If successful, go to step (9).\n   (8)  If unsuccessful and there\
    \ is another available address, try the\n        next available address.  Go to\
    \ step (7).  If all addresses are\n        not reachable and if a list of MX records\
    \ is being traversed,\n        try the next MX record (go to step (3)).  If there\
    \ is no list of\n        MX records, or if the end of the list of MX records has\
    \ been\n        reached, raise a temporary email delivery failure.  Finish.\n\
    \   (9)  Attempt to deliver the email over the connection established, as\n  \
    \      specified in RFC 2821.  If a transient failure condition is\n        reported,\
    \ try the next MX record (go to step (3)).  If an error\n        condition is\
    \ reported, raise a permanent email delivery error,\n        and do not try further\
    \ MX records.  Finish.  If successful, SMTP\n        delivery has succeeded. \
    \ Finish.\n"

    \ MX records in a DNS database in a dual-stack\n   environment, reachability between\

    \ be gathered at the\n   primary MX host, \"mx1.example.org.\":\n      example.org.\

    \ is an IPv6-only node, and the others are IPv4-\n   only nodes, there is no reachability\
    \ between the primary MX host and\n   the other MX hosts.  When email reaches\
    \ one of the lower MX hosts, it\n   cannot be relayed to the primary MX host based\
    \ on MX preferencing\n   mechanism.  Therefore, mx1.example.org will not be able\

    \ cases could use help from IPv6-to-IPv4\n   translators such as [Hagino].  Normally\
    \ there are no special SMTP\n   considerations for translators needed.  If there\
    \ is SMTP traffic from\n   an IPv6 MTA to an IPv4 MTA over an IPv6-to-IPv4 translator,\
    \ the IPv4\n   MTA will consider this normal IPv4 SMTP traffic.\n   Protocols\
    \ like IDENT [St.Johns] may require special consideration\n   when translators\
    \ are used.  Also, there are MTAs which perform strict\n   checks on the SMTP\
    \ HELO/EHLO \"domain\" parameter (perform\n   reverse/forward DNS lookups and\
    \ see if the \"domain\" really associates\n   to the SMTP client's IP address).\
    \  In such a case, we need a special\n   consideration when translators will be\
    \ used (for instance, override\n   \"domain\" parameter by translator's FQDN/address).\n\
    \   Even without a translator, it seems that there are some MTA\n   implementations\
    \ in the wild which send IPv6 address literals in a\n   HELO/EHLO message (like\
    \ \"HELO [IPv6:blah]\"), even when it is using\n   IPv4 transport, or vice versa.\
    \  If the SMTP peer is IPv4-only, it\n   won't understand the \"[IPv6:blah]\"\
    \ syntax and mails won't go out of\n   the (broken) MTA.  These implementations\
    \ have to be corrected.\n"
