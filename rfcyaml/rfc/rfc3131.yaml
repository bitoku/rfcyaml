  - "1. Conventions used in this document\n   This document uses significant terminology\
    \ that is specialized to\n   IETF, 3GPP2, or their areas of work.  See appendix\
    \ A for definitions\n   of acronyms.  The organizational definitions can be found\
    \ in their\n   respective web-sites.\n"
- title: 2. Introduction
  contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   This document contains a set of principles and guidelines\
    \ that serves\n   as the basis for establishing the collaboration between 3GPP2\
    \ and\n   IETF, with the objective of securing timely development of technical\n\
    \   specification that facilitate maximum interoperability with existing\n   (fixed\
    \ and mobile) Internet systems, devices, and protocols.\n   Each organization\
    \ will operate according to their own rules and\n   procedures including rules\
    \ governing IPR policy, specification\n   elaboration, approval and maintenance.\n"

- title: 3.1 3GPP2 use of IETF Internet Standards
  contents:
  - "3.1 3GPP2 use of IETF Internet Standards\n   In the further development of 3GPP2\
    \ specifications, the benefit of\n   adopting Internet specifications has been\
    \ identified.\n   The preferred 3GPP2 approach is to use the Internet standards\n\
    \   unchanged, if feasible.  In any case, 3GPP2 has no intention to\n   duplicate\
    \ work performed in IETF.\n   However, while this document recognizes the importance\
    \ of 3GPP2\n   interoperability with the existing Internet and hence the use of\
    \ IETF\n   standards, 3GPP2 recognizes that additions or modifications might be\n\
    \   needed in order to make the IETF internet specification fulfill the\n   needs\
    \ of 3GPP2.  In such cases, 3GPP2 will take its concerns directly\n   to the appropriate\
    \ IETF working groups for resolution, or to an\n   appropriate Area Director if\
    \ no appropriate working group can be\n   found.\n"
- title: 3.2 IETF access to 3GPP2 Wireless expertise
  contents:
  - "3.2 IETF access to 3GPP2 Wireless expertise\n   The technical work in 3GPP2 is\
    \ organized in Technical Specification\n   Groups TSGs each with their area of\
    \ responsibilities.  TSG-A and\n   TSG-C are responsible for the Radio Access\
    \ networks based on CDMA and\n   thus the experts in the areas of the characteristics\
    \ of the physical\n   transport.  TSG-N is responsible for the Mobility Management\
    \ and\n   other core network protocol and functionalities.  TSG-P is\n   responsible\
    \ for data services and applications.  TSG-S is responsible\n   for the service\
    \ and system aspects including the overall\n   architecture, security and O&M\
    \ aspects.  Contacts for the TSGs can be\n   found on the 3GPP2 web-site www.3gpp2.org.\n"
- title: 4. Document Sharing
  contents:
  - "4. Document Sharing\n   Both 3GPP2 and IETF encourage the sharing of draft documents\
    \ that are\n   of mutual interest.\n   3GPP2 working documents are available on\
    \ its official web-site, and\n   are grouped according to the meeting.  These\
    \ documents can be found\n   on the 3GPP2 ftp server, which is open to anyone,\
    \ at\n   ftp://ftp.3gpp2.org.  3GPP2 specifications, those that have completed\n\
    \   the 15-day Steering Committee review, can be found at:\n      http://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/Specs/index.cfm\n\
    \   IETF documents, including preliminary working documents (\"Internet\n   Drafts\"\
    ) are available on its web-site (http://www.ietf.org/) and\n   various shadow\
    \ sites.\n   IETF representatives can obtain information about the 3GPP2 document\n\
    \   and web-site structures by contacting the relevant 3GPP2 contact\n   points\
    \ indicated at the 3GPP2 web-site (www.3gpp2.org).\n   3GPP2 representatives can\
    \ obtain information about the IETF document\n   and web-site structures by contacting\
    \ the relevant IETF contact\n   points, which are the Area Directors indicated\
    \ at the IETF web-site\n   (www.ietf.org).\n"
- title: 5. Communication
  contents:
  - "5. Communication\n   Whenever possible, informal communication at working level\
    \ is\n   encouraged.\n   The vast majority of the technical discussions and decision\
    \ making at\n   IETF is done over mailing lists.  It is recommended that interested\n\
    \   individuals subscribe to and participate in these lists.\n   3GPP2 mailing\
    \ lists, however, are not open to the general public.  It\n   is recommended that\
    \ work of mutual interest be discussed on the\n   relevant IETF mailing lists.\n\
    \   When deemed necessary, formal communication between 3GPP2 and IETF is\n  \
    \ also permitted.  Relevant IETF Area Directors and 3GPP2 technical\n   leadership\
    \ are encouraged and authorized to facilitate such\n   communications when needed.\n"

- title: 6.1 IETF coordination support in 3GPP2
  contents:
  - "6.1 IETF coordination support in 3GPP2\n   An IETF rapporteur function is established\
    \ in 3GPP2 Steering\n   Committee.\n   The individual(s) appointed to undertake\
    \ the responsibility of this\n   function should be the initial contact point\
    \ in 3GPP2 for matters\n   pertaining to the 3GPP2-IETF cooperation.  Of course,\
    \ the chairman of\n   Steering Committee can always be contacted.\n   The 3GPP2-IETF\
    \ rapporteur function, therefore, is expected to work\n   with the concerned working\
    \ groups and TSGs and support the\n   interaction between 3GPP2 and IETF.\n"
- title: 6.2 3GPP2 Liaison in IETF
  contents:
  - "6.2 3GPP2 Liaison in IETF\n   The preferred way for organizations to work with\
    \ IETF is through the\n   working groups.  However, IETF has a limited number\
    \ of liaison\n   relationships with other organizations when conditions warrant\
    \ the\n   appointment of a specific person.\n   The appointment of a specific\
    \ person in IESG to function as a \"3GPP2\n   liaison\" is proposed.\n   The role\
    \ of the 3GPP2 Liaison is to act as an initial contact point\n   in IETF for administrative\
    \ aspects of this collaboration that cannot\n   easily be handled in other ways\
    \ (e.g., at a technical level by\n   interactions with IETF Working Groups or\
    \ Area Directors).  It is\n   agreed that the role does not carry the expectation\
    \ of attendance at\n   3GPP2 meetings or participation in 3GPP2 administrative\
    \ processes and\n   anticipated that all liaison efforts assigned to this individual\
    \ will\n   be carried out by electronic mail.  It is understood that the liaison\n\
    \   will not have the ability to make exceptions to, or special\n   provisions\
    \ for, IETF policies and procedures.\n"
- title: 7. Participation
  contents:
  - "7. Participation\n   In order to assist the information flow between the organizations,\n\
    \   IETF can on a per case basis appoint an observer to participate and\n   represent\
    \ IETF at 3GPP2 technical meetings.\n   IETF meetings are open to any interested\
    \ individuals.\n   3GPP2 partners (OPs, MRPs) or individual members can participate\
    \ in\n   any of the IETF meetings, in accordance with the existing IETF\n   procedures.\n\
    \   3GPP2 meetings are also open to any interested individual, however\n   such\
    \ individuals do not have voting privileges.  The meeting schedule\n   can be\
    \ found on the 3GPP2 web site.\n"
