  contents:
  - "Not All RFCs Are Standards\n   The \"Request for Comments\" (RFC) document series\
    \ is the official\n   publication channel for Internet standards documents and\
    \ other\n   publications of the IESG, IAB, and Internet community.  From time\
    \ to\n   time, and about every six months in the last few years, someone\n   questions\
    \ the rationality of publishing both Internet standards and\n   informational\
    \ documents as RFCs.  The argument is generally that this\n   introduces some\
    \ confusion between \"real standards\" and \"mere\n   publications\".\n   It is\
    \ a regrettably well spread misconception that publication as an\n   RFC provides\
    \ some level of recognition.  It does not, or at least not\n   any more than the\
    \ publication in a regular journal.  In fact, each\n   RFC has a status, relative\
    \ to its relation with the Internet\n   standardization process: Informational,\
    \ Experimental, or Standards\n   Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, Internet\
    \ Standard), or\n   Historic.  This status is reproduced on the first page of\
    \ the RFC\n   itself, and is also documented in the periodic \"Internet Official\n\
    \   Protocols Standards\" RFC (STD 1).  But this status is sometimes\n   omitted\
    \ from quotes and references, which may feed the confusion.\n   There are two\
    \ important sources of information on the status of the\n   Internet standards:\
    \  they are summarized periodically in an RFC\n   entitled \"Internet Official\
    \ Protocol Standards\" and they are\n   documented in the \"STD\" subseries. \
    \ When a specification has been\n   adopted as an Internet Standard, it is given\
    \ the additional label\n   \"STD xxxx\", but it keeps its RFC number and its place\
    \ in the RFC\n   series.\n   It is important to note that the relationship of\
    \ STD numbers to RFC\n   numbers is not one to one.  STD numbers identify protocols,\
    \ RFC\n   numbers identify documents.  Sometimes more than one document is used\n\
    \   to specify a Standard protocol.\n   In order to further increase the publicity\
    \ of the standardization\n   status, the IAB proposes the following actions:\n\
    \      Use the STD number, rather than just the RFC numbers, in the cross\n  \
    \    references between standard tracks documents,\n      Utilize the \"web\"\
    \ hypertext technology to publicize the state of\n      the standardization process.\n\
    \   More precisely, we propose to add to the current RFC repository an\n   \"\
    html\" version of the \"STD-1\" document, i.e., the list of Internet\n   standards.\
    \  We are considering the extension of this document to also\n   describes actions\
    \ in progress, i.e., standards track work at the\n   \"proposed\" or \"draft\"\
    \ stage.\n"
- title: A Single Archive
  contents:
  - "A Single Archive\n   The IAB believes that the community benefitted significantly\
    \ from\n   having a single archival document series.  Documents are easy to find\n\
    \   and to retrieve, and file servers are easy to organize.  This has\n   been\
    \ very important over the long term.  Experience of the past shows\n   that subseries,\
    \ or series of limited scope, tend to vanish from the\n   network.  And, there\
    \ is no evidence that alternate document schemes\n   would result in less confusion.\n\
    \   Moreover, we believe that the presence of additional documents does\n   not\
    \ actually hurt the standardization process.  The solution which we\n   propose\
    \ is to better publicize the \"standard\" status of certain\n   documents, which\
    \ is made relatively easy by the advent of networked\n   hypertext technologies.\n"
- title: Rather Document Than Ignore
  contents:
  - "Rather Document Than Ignore\n   The RFC series includes some documents which\
    \ are informational by\n   nature and other documents which describe experiences.\
    \  A problem of\n   perception occurs when such a document \"looks like\" an official\n\
    \   protocol specification.  Misguided vendors may claim conformance to\n   it,\
    \ and misguided clients may actually believe that they are buying\n   an Internet\
    \ standard.\n   The IAB believes that the proper help to misguided vendors and\n\
    \   clients is to provide them guidance.  There is actually very little\n   evidence\
    \ of vendors purposely attempting to present informational or\n   experimental\
    \ RFCs as \"Internet standards\".  If such attempts\n   occurred, proper response\
    \ would indeed be required.\n   The IAB believes that the community is best served\
    \ by openly\n   developed specifications.  The Internet standardization process\n\
    \   provides guarantees of openness and thorough review, and the normal\n   way\
    \ to develop the specification of an Internet protocol is indeed\n   through the\
    \ IETF.\n   The community is also well served by having access to specifications\n\
    \   of which have been developed outside the IETF standards process,\n   either\
    \ because the protocols are experimental in nature, were\n   developed privately,\
    \ or failed to achieve the acquire the degree of\n   consensus required for elevation\
    \ to the standards track.\n   The IAB believes that publication is better than\
    \ ignorance.  If a\n   particular specification ends up being used in products\
    \ that are\n   deployed over the Internet, we are better off if the specification\
    \ is\n   easy to retrieve as an RFC than if it is hidden in some private\n   repository.\n"
