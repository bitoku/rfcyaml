  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document creates the new Session Initiation Protocol\
    \ (SIP)\n   Resource Priority header (RPH) field namespace 'esnet' for local\n\
    \   emergency usage and registers this namespace with IANA.  The SIP\n   Resource-Priority\
    \ header field is defined in RFC 4412 [RFC4412].  The\n   new 'esnet' namespace\
    \ is to be used for inbound calls towards a\n   public safety answering point\
    \ (PSAP), between PSAPs, and between a\n   PSAP and first responders or their\
    \ organizations within managed IP\n   networks.  This namespace is not for use\
    \ on the open public Internet\n   because it can be trivially forged.\n   Adding\
    \ an RPH with the 'esnet' namespace can be differentiated from\n   the marking\
    \ of an emergency call using a service URN as defined in\n   [RFC5031] in that\
    \ the RPH specifically requests preferential\n   treatment in networks that honor\
    \ it, while the marking merely\n   identifies an emergency call without necessarily\
    \ affecting resources\n   allocated to it.  It is appropriate to use both where\
    \ applicable.\n   RPH with 'esnet' may also be used within public safety networks\
    \ for\n   SIP sessions that are not emergency calls and thus not marked per RFC\n\
    \   5031.\n   This new namespace is included in SIP requests to provide an explicit\n\
    \   priority indication within controlled environments, such as an IP\n   Multimedia\
    \ Subsystem (IMS) infrastructure or Emergency Services\n   network (ESInet) where\
    \ misuse can be reduced to an acceptable level\n   because these types of networks\
    \ have controls in place.  The function\n   facilitates differing treatment of\
    \ emergency SIP requests according\n   to local policy, or more likely, a contractual\
    \ agreement between the\n   network organizations.  This indication is used solely\
    \ to\n   differentiate certain SIP requests, transactions, or dialogs from\n \
    \  other SIP requests, transactions, or dialogs that do not have the\n   need\
    \ for priority treatment.  If there are differing, yet still\n   understandable\
    \ and valid Resource-Priority header values in separate\n   SIP requests, then\
    \ this indication can be used by local policy to\n   determine which SIP request,\
    \ transaction, or dialog receives which\n   treatment (likely better or worse\
    \ than another).\n   Application Service Providers (ASPs) that are securely connected\
    \ to\n   an ESInet may have sufficient controls policing the header, and a\n \
    \  trust relationship with the entities inside the ESInet.  SIP requests\n   from\
    \ such ASPs could make use of this 'esnet' namespace for\n   appropriate treatment\
    \ when requests are passed from the ASP to the\n   ESInet.\n   The 'esnet' namespace\
    \ may also be used on calls from a PSAP or other\n   public safety agency on an\
    \ ESInet towards a private or public\n   network, ASP or User Agent (\"call back\"\
    ) when priority is needed.\n   Again, the request for priority is not for use\
    \ on the public Internet\n   due to the ease of forging the header.\n   This document\
    \ merely creates the namespace, per the rules within\n   [RFC4412] as updated\
    \ by [RFC7134], which necessitates that new RPH\n   namespaces and their relative\
    \ priority-value order be IETF reviewed\n   before being registered with IANA.\n\
    \   There is the possibility that within emergency services networks,\n   Multilevel\
    \ Precedence and Preemption (MLPP)-like behavior can be\n   achieved (likely without\
    \ the 'preemption' part), provided the local\n   policy supports enabling this\
    \ function.  For example, calls placed\n   between law enforcement agents could\
    \ be marked similarly to MLPP\n   systems used by military networks, and some\
    \ of those calls could be\n   handled with higher priority than an emergency call\
    \ from an ordinary\n   user.  Therefore, the 'esnet' namespace is given five priority-levels\n\
    \   instead of just one.  This document does not define MLPP-like SIP\n   signaling\
    \ for emergency calls like those using emergency service\n   numbers (such as\
    \ 911, 112, and 999), but it is not prevented either.\n   Within the ESInet, there\
    \ will be emergency calls requiring different\n   treatments, according to the\
    \ type of call.  Does a citizen's call to\n   a PSAP require the same, a higher,\
    \ or a lower relative priority than\n   a PSAP's call to a police department or\
    \ the police chief?  What about\n   either relative to a call from within the\
    \ ESInet to a national\n   government's department responsible for public safety,\
    \ disaster\n   relief, national security/defense, etc.?  For these additional\n\
    \   reasons, the 'esnet' namespace has multiple priority levels.\n   This document\
    \ does not define any of these behaviors, outside of\n   reminding readers that\
    \ the rules of RFC 4412 apply - though examples\n   of usage are included for\
    \ completeness.  This document registers the\n   'esnet' RPH namespace with IANA\
    \ for use within any emergency services\n   networks, not just of those from citizens\
    \ to PSAPs.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Rules of Usage of the Resource Priority Header field
  contents:
  - "2.  Rules of Usage of the Resource Priority Header field\n   This document retains\
    \ the behaviors of the SIP Resource Priority\n   header field, defined in [RFC4412],\
    \ when choosing between the\n   treatment options surrounding this new 'esnet'\
    \ namespace.  Given the\n   environment this is to be used within (i.e., within\
    \ an ESInet), the\n   usage of the 'esnet' namespace does not have a 'normal'\
    \ or routine\n   call level; that is left for local jurisdictions to define within\n\
    \   their respective parts of the ESInet, which could be islands of local\n  \
    \ administration.\n   The 'esnet' namespace MUST only be used where at least one\
    \ end of the\n   signaling, setting aside the placement of B2BUAs (Back-to-Back\
    \ User\n   Agents), is within a local emergency organization.  In other words,\n\
    \   if either the originating human caller's User Agent (UA) or the\n   destination\
    \ human callee's UA is part of the local emergency\n   organization, this is a\
    \ valid use of 'esnet'.\n   The 'esnet' namespace has 5 priority-values, in a\
    \ specified relative\n   priority order, and is registered as a queue-based namespace\
    \ in\n   compliance with [RFC4412].  SIP entities that support preemption\n  \
    \ treatment (see Section 5 of [RFC4412]) can be configured according to\n   local\
    \ policy.  Display names for the 'esnet' values displayed can\n   likewise be\
    \ set according to local policy.\n   The following network diagram provides one\
    \ example of local policy\n   choices when using the 'esnet' namespace:\n    \

- title: 3.  "esnet" Namespace Definition
  contents:
  - "3.  \"esnet\" Namespace Definition\n   The 'esnet' namespace is not generic for\
    \ all emergencies because\n   there are a lot of different kinds of emergencies,\
    \ some on a military\n   scale ([RFC4412] defines 3 of these), some on a national\
    \ scale\n   ([RFC4412] defines 2 of these), and some on an international scale.\n\
    \   Each type of emergency can also have its own namespace(s); although\n   there\
    \ are many defined for other uses, more are possible -- so using\n   the public\
    \ emergency service number (such as 911, 112, or 999) to\n   call for police officers,\
    \ firefighters, or emergency medical\n   technicians (etc.) does not have a monopoly\
    \ on the word \"emergency\".\n   The namespace 'esnet' has been chosen, roughly\
    \ to stand for\n   \"Emergency Services NETwork\", for a citizen's call for help\
    \ from a\n   public authority type of organization.  This namespace will also\
    \ be\n   used for communications between emergency authorities, and it MAY be\n\
    \   used by emergency authorities to call public citizens.  An example of\n  \
    \ the latter is a PSAP operator calling back someone who previously\n   called\
    \ an emergency service number (such as 911, 112, or 999) and the\n   communication\
    \ was terminated before it -- in the PSAP operator's\n   judgment -- should have\
    \ been.\n   Below is an example of a Resource-Priority header field using the\n\
    \   'esnet' namespace:\n         Resource-Priority: esnet.0\n"
- title: 3.1.  Namespace Definition Rules and Guidelines
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Namespace Definition Rules and Guidelines\n   This specification defines\
    \ one unique namespace for emergency calling\n   scenarios, 'esnet' and registers\
    \ this namespace with IANA.  This IANA\n   registration contains the facets defined\
    \ in Section 9 of [RFC4412].\n"
- title: 3.2.  The 'esnet' Namespace
  contents:
  - "3.2.  The 'esnet' Namespace\n   Per the rules of [RFC4412], each namespace has\
    \ a finite set of\n   relative priority-value(s), listed (below) from lowest priority\
    \ to\n   highest priority.  In an attempt to not limit this namespace's use in\n\
    \   the future, more than one priority-value is assigned to the 'esnet'\n   namespace.\
    \  This document does not recommend which Priority-value is\n   used where in\
    \ which situation or scenario.  That is for another\n   document to specify. \
    \ To be effective, the choice within a national\n   jurisdiction needs to be coordinated\
    \ by all sub-jurisdictions to\n   maintain uniform SIP behavior throughout an\
    \ emergency calling system\n   of that nation.\n   The relative priority order\
    \ for the 'esnet' namespace is as follows:\n         (lowest)  esnet.0\n     \
    \              esnet.1\n                   esnet.2\n                   esnet.3\n\
    \         (highest) esnet.4\n   The 'esnet' namespace will have priority queuing\
    \ registrations for\n   these levels per Section 4.5.2 of [RFC4412].  Although\
    \ no preemption\n   is specified in this document for any levels of 'esnet', local\n\
    \   jurisdiction(s) MAY configure their SIP infrastructure to use this\n   namespace\
    \ with preemption, as defined in RFC 4412.\n   The remaining rules that originated\
    \ in RFC 4412 apply with regard to\n   an RP actor who understands more than one\
    \ namespace, and must\n   maintain its locally significant relative priority order.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The Security considerations that apply to RFC\
    \ 4412 [RFC4412] apply\n   here.\n   For networks that act on the SIP Resource-Priority\
    \ header field,\n   incorrect use of namespaces can result in traffic that should\
    \ have\n   been given preferential treatment not receiving it, and vice versa.\n\
    \   This document does not define a use case where an endpoint outside\n   the\
    \ ESInet marks its call for preferential treatment.  Precautions\n   need to be\
    \ taken to prevent granting preferential treatment to\n   unauthorized users not\
    \ calling for emergency help even if they are in\n   the ESInet, as well as to\
    \ prevent misuse by callers outside the\n   ESInet.\n   A simple means of preventing\
    \ this usage is to not allow traffic\n   marked 'esnet' to get preferential treatment\
    \ unless the destination\n   is towards the local/regional ESInet.  This is not\
    \ a consideration\n   for internetwork traffic within the ESInet, or generated\
    \ out of the\n   ESInet.  Calling an emergency service number (such as 911, 112,\
    \ or\n   999) is fairly local in nature, with a finite number of URIs that are\n\
    \   likely to be considered valid within a portion of a network receiving\n  \
    \ SIP signaling.\n   This namespace is not intended for use on the Internet because\
    \ of the\n   difficulty in detecting abuse; specifically, it can trivially be\n\
    \   forged and used on a non-emergency session to obtain resource\n   priority.\
    \  Some networks may determine that it can reasonably prevent\n   abuse and/or\
    \ that the consequences of undetected abuse is not\n   significant.  In such cases,\
    \ use of 'esnet' on the Internet MAY be\n   allowed.\n"
