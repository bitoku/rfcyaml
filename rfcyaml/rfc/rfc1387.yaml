- title: Status of this Memo
  contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo provides information for the Internet community.\
    \  It does\n   not specify an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is\n\
    \   unlimited.\n"
- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   As required by Routing Protocol Criteria (RFC 1264), this report\n\
    \   documents the key features of the RIP-2 protocol and the current\n   implementation\
    \ experience.\n"
- title: Acknowledgements
  contents:
  - "Acknowledgements\n   The RIP-2 protocol owes much to those who participated in\
    \ the RIP-2\n   Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). \
    \ A\n   special thanks goes to Fred Baker for his help on the MIB, and to\n  \
    \ Jeffrey Honig for the implementation experience.\n"
- title: 1.  Protocol Documents
  contents:
  - "1.  Protocol Documents\n   The RIP-2 protocol description is defined in RFC 1388\
    \ [1].  This memo\n   suggests an update to the \"Routing Information Protocol\"\
    \ (RFC 1058)\n   [3].  The RIP-2 MIB description is defined in RFC 1389 [2].\n"
- title: 2.  Key Features
  contents:
  - "2.  Key Features\n   While RIP-2 shares the same basic algorithms as RIP-1, it\
    \ supports\n   several new features.  They are: routing domains, external route\n\
    \   tags, subnet masks, next hop addresses, and authentication.\n"
- title: 2.1  Routing Domains
  contents:
  - "2.1  Routing Domains\n   Routing domains allow multiple RIP \"clouds\" to exist\
    \ over the same\n   physical network.  This is a feature requested by several\
    \ members of\n   the working group.  It allows simple policies to be constructed\
    \ by\n   grouping routers into domains which share routing information.\n"
- title: 2.2  External Route Tags
  contents:
  - "2.2  External Route Tags\n   The route tag field may be used to propagate information\
    \ acquired\n   from an EGP.  The definition of the contents of this field are\
    \ beyond\n   the scope of this protocol.  However, it may be used, for example,\
    \ to\n   propagate an EGP AS number.\n"
- title: 2.3  Subnet Masks
  contents:
  - "2.3  Subnet Masks\n   Inclusion of subnet masks was the original intent of opening\
    \ the RIP\n   protocol for improvement.  Subnet mask information makes RIP more\n\
    \   useful in a variety of environments and allows the use of variable\n   subnet\
    \ masks on the network.  Subnet masks are also necessary for\n   implementation\
    \ of \"classless\" addressing, as the CIDR work proposes.\n"
- title: 2.4  Next Hop Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.4  Next Hop Addresses\n   Support for next hop addresses allows for optimization\
    \ of routes in\n   an environment which uses multiple routing protocols.  For\
    \ example,\n   if RIP-2 were being run on a network along with another IGP, and\
    \ one\n   router ran both protocols, then that router could indicate to the\n\
    \   other RIP-2 routers that a better next hop than itself exists for a\n   given\
    \ destination.\n"
- title: 2.5  Authentication
  contents:
  - "2.5  Authentication\n   One significant improvement RIP-2 offers over RIP-1,\
    \ is the addition\n   of an authentication mechanism.  Essentially, it is the\
    \ same\n   extensible mechanism provided by OSPF.  Currently, only a plain-text\n\
    \   password is defined for authentication.  However, more sophisticated\n   authentication\
    \ schemes can easily be incorporated as they are\n   defined.\n"
- title: 2.6  Multicasting
  contents:
  - "2.6  Multicasting\n   RIP-2 packets may be multicast instead of being broadcast.\
    \  The use\n   of an IP multicast address reduces the load on hosts which do not\n\
    \   support routing protocols.  It also allows RIP-2 routers to share\n   information\
    \ which RIP-1 routers cannot hear.  This is useful since a\n   RIP-1 router may\
    \ misinterpret route information because it cannot\n   apply the supplied subnet\
    \ mask.\n"
- title: 3.  RIP-2 MIB
  contents:
  - "3.  RIP-2 MIB\n   The MIB for RIP-2 allows for monitoring and control of RIP's\n\
    \   operation within the router.  In addition to global and per-interface\n  \
    \ counters and controls, there is are per-peer counters which provide\n   the\
    \ status of RIP-2 \"neighbors\".\n"
- title: 4.  Implementations
  contents:
  - "4.  Implementations\n   Currently, there is one nearly complete implementation\
    \ of RIP-2.  A\n   \"gated\" implementation is now available with RIP-2, written\
    \ by\n   Jeffrey Honig at Cornell University.  It may be acquired by anonymous\n\
    \   FTP from gated.cornell.edu as pub/gated/gated-alpha.tar.Z.  It\n   implements\
    \ multicasting, subnet masks, limited authentication, next-\n   hop, and limited\
    \ routing domain support.  A RIP-2 version of ripquery\n   is also available.\
    \  The \"gated\" implementation does not yet support\n   full subsumption rules,\
    \ full authentication, full routing domains,\n   and the MIB.  It has been tested\
    \ against itself and various RIP-1\n   implementations.\n   A second, complete\
    \ implementation is under development by a vendor\n   who's identity cannot be\
    \ disclosed at this time.\n"
