Abstract This document registers Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) authentication schemes that have been defined in RFCs before the IANA HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry was established.
This document registers Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) authentication schemes that have been defined in RFCs before the IANA HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry was established.
There are no security considerations related to the registration itself.
Security considerations applicable to the individual authentication schemes ought to be discussed in the specifications that define them.
The registrations below have been added to the IANA "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Scheme Registry" at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http authschemes
> (see Section 5.1 of [RFC7235]).
