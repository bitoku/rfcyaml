  - "1.  Introduction\n   Vendor-specific messages have traditionally allowed vendors
    to\n   implement extensions to some protocols and distinguish themselves\n   from
    other vendors.  These messages are clearly marked by a Vendor ID\n   that identifies
    the vendor.  A particular vendor's implementation\n   identifies the vendor extension
    by recognizing the Vendor ID.\n   Implementations that do not recognize the Vendor
    ID either discard or\n   skip processing the message.\n   Mobile IPv6 [2] is being
    deployed and there is a need for vendor-\n   specific extensions to Mobility Header
    messages so that vendors are\n   able to extend the Mobile IPv6 protocol for research
    or deployment\n   purposes.\n   This document defines a new mobility option, the
    Vendor-Specific\n   Mobility Option, which can be carried in any Mobility Header
    message.\n   The Vendor-Specific mobility option MUST be used only with a Mobility\n
    \  Header message.  Mobility options, by definition, can be skipped if\n   an
    implementation does not recognize the mobility option type [2].\n   The messages
    defined in this document can also be used for NEMO [3]\n   and Proxy MIPv6 [4]
    since these protocols also use Mobility Header\n   messages.\n   Vendor-specific
    protocol extensions can cause serious\n   interoperability issues and may in addition
    have adverse operational\n   impact, if they are not designed and used carefully.
    \ The vendor-\n   specific option described in this document is meant to support
    simple\n   use cases where it is sufficient to include some vendor data in the\n
    \  standardized Mobile IPv6 protocol exchanges.  The vendor-specific\n   option
    is not suitable for more complex vendor extensions that modify\n   Mobile IPv6
    itself.  Although these options allow vendors to\n   piggyback additional data
    onto Mobile IPv6 message exchanges, RFC\n   3775 [2] requires that unrecognized
    options be ignored and that the\n   end systems be able to process the remaining
    parts of the message\n   correctly.  Extensions that use the vendor-specific mobility
    option\n   should require an indication that the option was processed, in the\n
    \  response, using the vendor-specific mobility option.\n   Vendors are generally
    encouraged to bring their protocol extensions\n   to the IETF for review and standardization.
    \ Complex vendor\n   extensions that modify Mobile IPv6 itself, will see large-scale\n
    \  deployment or involve industry consortia, or other multi-vendor\n   organizations
    MUST be standardized in the IETF.  Past experience has\n   shown that such extensions
    of IETF protocols are critically dependent\n   on IETF review and standardization.\n"

  - "3.  Vendor-Specific Mobility Option\n   The Vendor Specific Mobility Option can
    be included in any Mobility\n   Header message and has an alignment requirement
    of 4n+2.  If the\n   Mobility Header message includes a Binding Authorization
    Data option\n   [2], then the Vendor Specific mobility option should appear before\n
    \  the Binding Authorization Data option.  Multiple Vendor-Specific\n   mobility
    options MAY be present in a Mobility Header message.\n      0                   1

    be protected in a manner\n   similar to Binding Updates and Binding Acknowledgements
    if it carries\n   information that should not be revealed on the wire or that
    can\n   affect the binding cache entry at the home agent or the correspondent\n
    \  node.  In particular, the messages containing the Vendor Specific\n   mobility
    option MUST be integrity protected.\n"
