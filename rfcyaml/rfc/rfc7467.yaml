  - "1.  Introduction\n   Historically, NATO has used standardized character-oriented\
    \ message\n   text formats (MTF) to interoperate, report, and exchange information\n\
    \   both among its commands and with national entities, commercial\n   partners,\
    \ and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).  These MTFs are\n   generated using\
    \ the NATO Message Text Formatting System (FORMETS) in\n   accordance with the\
    \ rules, constructions, and vocabulary specified\n   within the Allied Data Publication\
    \ Number 3 (ADatP-3).  Almost 400\n   NATO-defined messages that conform to ADatP-3\
    \ are contained in the\n   Allied Procedural Publication Number 11 (APP-11) NATO\
    \ Message\n   Catalogue [7].\n   Prior to 2008, these messages were only available\
    \ as slash-delimited\n   textual messages.  Since 2008, the APP-11 message catalogue\
    \ also\n   includes XML-MTF definitions for these messages, giving rise to a\n\
    \   need to define and manage a URN namespace to name the XML namespaces.\n  \
    \ To address this need, this document requests that a formal URN space\n   type\
    \ be assigned as described in Section 4.3 of RFC 3406.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.  Declaration of Syntactic Structure\n   The Namespace Specific String (NSS)\
    \ of all URNs that use the \"nato\"\n   NID shall have the following structure:\n\
    \   <URN> ::= \"urn:\" \"nato\" \":\" <NSS>\n   <NSS> ::= <Type> | <Type> \":\"\
    \ <Source> |\n             <Type> \":\" <Source> 1*( \":\" <segment> )\n   <Type>\
    \ ::= 1*<non-colon chars>\n   <Source> ::= 1*<non-colon chars>\n   <segment> \
    \ ::= 1*<non-colon chars>\n   <non-colon chars> ::= <non-colon trans> | \"%\"\
    \ <hex> <hex>\n   <non-colon trans> ::= <upper> | <lower> | <number> |\n     \
    \                    <non-colon other>\n   <hex>         ::= <number> | \"A\"\
    \ | \"B\" | \"C\" | \"D\" | \"E\" | \"F\" |\n                     \"a\" | \"b\"\
    \ | \"c\" | \"d\" | \"e\" | \"f\"\n   <non-colon other> ::= \"(\" | \")\" | \"\
    +\" | \",\" | \"-\" | \".\" |\n                     \"=\" | \"@\" | \";\" | \"\
    $\" |\"_\" | \"!\" | \"*\" | \"'\"\n   The \"Type\" is the top-level segment of\
    \ the NSS.  It is a required\n   US-ASCII string, subject to the above syntax,\
    \ that conforms to the\n   URN syntax requirements (see RFC 2141 [1]).  It identifies\
    \ a\n   particular category or type of named resources, such as \"mtf\".\n   The\
    \ \"Source\" is the second-level segment of the NSS, belonging to the\n   \"Type\"\
    \ context.  At this time, not all \"Type\" segments have \"Source\"\n   children,\
    \ making \"Source\" an optional US-ASCII string, subject to the\n   above syntax\
    \ and conformant to the URN syntax requirements (see RFC\n   2141 [1]).  \"Source\"\
    \ identifies a particular standard, catalogue, or\n   other relevant specifications.\n\
    \   The NATO Naming and Registration Authority (NRA) functions as a Local\n  \
    \ Internet Registry under RIPE NCC and will also serve as the\n   responsible\
    \ registrar for assigning the first two levels of segments\n   within the NSS\
    \ (\"Type\" and \"Source\").  The NRA may directly assign\n   segments below these\
    \ levels of the namespace hierarchy, or delegate\n   assignment responsibilities\
    \ for segments below the second level\n   (i.e., below \"Source\") at its discretion.\
    \  In either case, the NRA\n   will ensure that a registry of the resulting namespace\
    \ is maintained.\n"

- title: 2.8.  Process of Identifier Assignment
  contents:
  - "2.8.  Process of Identifier Assignment\n   A namespace-specific string within\
    \ the NATO namespace will only be\n   assigned upon advancement of a relevant\
    \ specification.  The Registrar\n   will check all requested identifiers against\
    \ the existing\n   registrations within urn:nato to ensure uniqueness and encourage\n\
    \   relevance.\n   The assignment may include delegated registration activities\
    \ for the\n   sub-tree if underpinned by supporting agreements.  Otherwise, such\n\
    \   responsibilities remain with the NRA as the overarching Registrar.\n   In\
    \ any case, the URN must be registered with appropriate metadata\n   before an\
    \ authorized request for URN resolution can be initiated (if\n   necessary).\n"

    \ this namespace may be\n   resolved using a NATO listing in an RDS, using a third-party-listed\n\
    \   resolver, an unlisted private resolver, or some combination of these.\n  \

  - "2.13.  Scope\n   Global.\n"
- title: 3.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Namespace Considerations\n   In addition to the large number of XML message\
    \ specifications that\n   now exist in APP-11, there are other existing and emerging\
    \ NATO\n   standard messages expressed as XML, as well as ongoing Web service\n\
    \   specification development.  With no single NID registered to NATO,\n   some\
    \ of these specifications may be established within locally\n   relevant, self-generated\
    \ URN namespaces.  Not only does this inhibit\n   the portability and adoption\
    \ intended by standards development [5],\n   it risks name collisions when exposed\
    \ to the global context of the\n   federation of partners for which these messages\
    \ are destined.\n   The use of Uniform Resource Names with an appropriate Namespace\
    \ ID\n   will enable the various NATO standards committees and working groups\n\
    \   [6] to use unique, relevant, reliable, permanent, managed, and\n   accessible\
    \ namespace names for their XML products.\n   A dedicated namespace also provides\
    \ NATO the opportunity to leverage\n   the use of URNs for persistent naming of\
    \ non-XML resources.\n"
- title: 4.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Community Considerations\n   The NATO standards development community, and\
    \ those implementing such\n   standards, will benefit from publication of this\
    \ namespace by having\n   more permanent and reliable names for the XML namespaces\
    \ defined\n   within STANAGs, the MTF catalogue (APP-11), and other published\n\
    \   standards [5].\n   Though these are NATO-published standards [5], they represent\
    \ the\n   consensus of multi-national working groups, are implemented in\n   commercial\
    \ products, and are used by partners within the\n   international community.\n\
    \   In the case of MTF standards [7], the responsibility for its\n   development\
    \ and maintenance belongs to the NATO C3 Board's Message\n   Text Formats (MFT)\
    \ Capability Team [6].  This team is \"open to all\n   recognized NATO Partners\
    \ around the Globe in principle.  The term\n   'Partners around the Globe' summarizes\
    \ all partners that are listed\n   on the NATO webpage: Euro-Atlantic Partnership\
    \ Council (EAPC), NATO's\n   Mediterranean Dialogue (MD), Istanbul Cooperation\
    \ Initiative (ICI)\n   and Partners across the globe\" [8].\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Since the URNs in this namespace are opaque,\
    \ there are no additional\n   security considerations other than those normally\
    \ associated with the\n   use and resolution of URIs and URNs in general (see\
    \ the Security\n   Considerations in Internet STD 66 [4], RFC 2141 [1], and BCP\
    \ 66 [2]).\n   It is noted, however, that resolution algorithms and rules for\n\
    \   handling invalid URNs are opaque.  Therefore, attempting to resolve a\n  \
    \ NATO URN through a resolver other than one operated or delegated by\n   NATO\
    \ may return outdated, incorrect, or confusing results.\n   Distribution of NATO\
    \ information in any form is subject to its\n   security policies.  Nonetheless,\
    \ this specification is for public use\n   and not subject to any NATO security\
    \ policies.\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This document registers the formal URN NID \"nato\"\
    , which has been\n   entered into the \"Formal URN Namespaces\" IANA registry\
    \ [9].  Per\n   Section 4.3 of RFC 3406 [2], formal NIDs are assigned via IETF\n\
    \   Consensus and are subject to IESG review and acceptance.  The\n   registration\
    \ template is given in Section 2.\n"
- title: 7.  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "7.  Conclusions\n   It is necessary that NATO ensures its messages, service\n\
    \   specifications, and other XML artefacts are based in namespaces that\n   can\
    \ be described using unique, persistent, and managed URNs.\n   Considering its\
    \ role as an information broker between many disparate\n   communities, this document\
    \ registers a formal namespace identifier\n   (NID) \"nato\" for Uniform Resource\
    \ Names (URN) associated with NATO\n   information products and vocabularies:\
