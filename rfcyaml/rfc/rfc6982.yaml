- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Most IETF participants are familiar with the saying \"rough\
    \ consensus\n   and running code\" [Tao] and can identify with its pragmatic approach.\n\
    \   However, implementation is not a requirement for publication as an\n   RFC.\
    \  There are many examples of Internet-Drafts containing protocol\n   specification\
    \ that have gone through to publication as Proposed\n   Standard RFCs without\
    \ implementation.  Some of them may never get\n   implemented.\n   Over time,\
    \ a variety of policies have been applied within the IETF to\n   consider running\
    \ code.  In the Routing Area, it used to be a\n   requirement that one or more\
    \ implementations must exist before an\n   Internet-Draft could be published as\
    \ a Proposed Standard RFC\n   [RFC1264].  That RFC was later obsoleted and the\
    \ requirement for\n   implementation was lifted, but each working group was given\
    \ the\n   authority to impose its own implementation requirements [RFC4794] and\n\
    \   at least one working group, Inter-Domain Routing (IDR), continues to\n   require\
    \ two independent implementations.\n   The hypothesis behind the current document\
    \ is that there are benefits\n   to the IETF standardization process of producing\
    \ implementations of\n   protocol specifications before publication as RFCs. \
    \ These benefits,\n   which include determining that the specification is comprehensible\n\
    \   and that there is sufficient interest to implement, are further\n   discussed\
    \ in Section 4.\n   This document describes a simple mechanism that allows authors\
    \ of\n   Internet-Drafts to record and publicize the status of known\n   implementations\
    \ by including an Implementation Status section.  The\n   document defines (quite\
    \ informally) the contents of this section to\n   ensure that the relevant information\
    \ is included.  This will allow\n   reviewers and working groups to assign due\
    \ consideration to documents\n   that have the benefit of running code, which\
    \ may serve as evidence of\n   valuable experimentation and feedback that have\
    \ made the implemented\n   protocols more mature.\n   It is up to the individual\
    \ working groups to use this information as\n   they see fit, but one result might\
    \ be the preferential treatment of\n   documents, resulting in them being processed\
    \ more rapidly.  We\n   recommend that the Implementation Status section should\
    \ be removed\n   from Internet-Drafts before they are published as RFCs.  As a\
    \ result,\n   we do not envisage changes to this section after approval of the\n\
    \   document for publication, e.g., the RFC errata process does not\n   apply.\n\
    \   The process in this document is offered as an experiment (though not\n   as\
    \ an [RFC3933] experiment; see Section 5).  Authors of Internet-\n   Drafts are\
    \ encouraged to consider using the process for their\n   documents, and working\
    \ groups are invited to think about applying the\n   process to all of their protocol\
    \ specifications.\n   The scope of the intended experiment is all Internet-Drafts\
    \ (I-Ds)\n   that contain implementable specifications, whether produced within\n\
    \   IETF working groups or outside working groups but intended for IETF\n   consensus.\
    \  I-Ds published on the Independent Stream are explicitly\n   out of scope. \
    \ It is expected that the greatest benefit in the\n   experiment will be seen\
    \ with Standards Track documents developed\n   within working groups.\n   The\
    \ authors of this document intend to collate experiences with this\n   experiment\
    \ and to report them to the community.\n"
- title: 2.  The "Implementation Status" Section
  contents:
  - "2.  The \"Implementation Status\" Section\n   Each Internet-Draft may contain\
    \ a section entitled \"Implementation\n   Status\".  This section, if it appears,\
    \ should be located just before\n   the \"Security Considerations\" section and\
    \ contain, for each existing\n   implementation, some or all of the following:\n\
    \   o  The organization responsible for the implementation, if any.\n   o  The\
    \ implementation's name and/or a link to a web page describing\n      the implementation.\n\
    \   o  A brief general description.\n   o  The implementation's level of maturity:\
    \ research, prototype,\n      alpha, beta, production, widely used, etc.\n   o\
    \  Coverage: which parts of the protocol specification are\n      implemented\
    \ and which versions of the Internet-Draft were\n      implemented.\n   o  Licensing:\
    \ the terms under which the implementation can be used.\n      For example: proprietary,\
    \ royalty licensing, freely distributable\n      with acknowledgement (BSD style),\
    \ freely distributable with\n      requirement to redistribute source (General\
    \ Public License (GPL)\n      style), and other (specify).\n   o  Implementation\
    \ experience: any useful information the implementers\n      want to share with\
    \ the community.\n   o  Contact information: ideally a person's name and email\
    \ address,\n      but possibly just a URL or mailing list.\n   In addition, this\
    \ section can contain information about the\n   interoperability of any or all\
    \ of the implementations, including\n   references to test-case descriptions and\
    \ interoperability reports,\n   when such exist.\n   Working group chairs and\
    \ area directors (ADs) are requested to ensure\n   that this section is not used\
    \ as a marketing venue for specific\n   implementations.\n   Since this information\
    \ is necessarily time dependent, it is\n   inappropriate for inclusion in a published\
    \ RFC.  The authors should\n   include a note to the RFC Editor requesting that\
    \ the section be\n   removed before publication.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Introductory Text
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Introductory Text\n   The following boilerplate text is proposed to head\
    \ the Implementation\n   Status section:\n      This section records the status\
    \ of known implementations of the\n      protocol defined by this specification\
    \ at the time of posting of\n      this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal\
    \ described in RFC\n      6982.  The description of implementations in this section\
    \ is\n      intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in\n      progressing\
    \ drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any\n      individual implementation\
    \ here does not imply endorsement by the\n      IETF.  Furthermore, no effort\
    \ has been spent to verify the\n      information presented here that was supplied\
    \ by IETF contributors.\n      This is not intended as, and must not be construed\
    \ to be, a\n      catalog of available implementations or their features.  Readers\n\
    \      are advised to note that other implementations may exist.\n      According\
    \ to RFC 6982, \"this will allow reviewers and working\n      groups to assign\
    \ due consideration to documents that have the\n      benefit of running code,\
    \ which may serve as evidence of valuable\n      experimentation and feedback\
    \ that have made the implemented\n      protocols more mature.  It is up to the\
    \ individual working groups\n      to use this information as they see fit\".\n\
    \   Authors are requested to add a note to the RFC Editor at the top of\n   this\
    \ section, advising the Editor to remove the entire section before\n   publication,\
    \ as well as the reference to RFC 6982.\n"
- title: 3.  Alternative Formats
  contents:
  - "3.  Alternative Formats\n   Sometimes it can be advantageous to publish the implementation\
    \ status\n   separately from the base Internet-Draft, e.g., on the IETF wiki:\n\
    \   o  When the Implementation Status section becomes too large to be\n      conveniently\
    \ managed within the document.\n   o  When a working group decides to have implementors,\
    \ rather than\n      authors, keep the status of their implementations current.\n\
    \   o  When a working group already maintains an active wiki and prefers\n   \
    \   to use it for this purpose.\n   o  If the working group decides that the information\
    \ is still\n      valuable (and needs to be kept current) after the I-D is published\n\
    \      as an RFC, and the Implementation Status section had been removed\n   \
    \   from it.\n   It is highly desirable for all readers of the Internet-Draft\
    \ to be\n   made aware of this information.  Initially, this can be done by\n\
    \   replacing the Implementation Status section's contents with a URL\n   pointing\
    \ to the wiki.  Later, the IETF Tools may support this\n   functionality, e.g.,\
    \ by including such a link in the HTML file of the\n   document, similar to the\
    \ IPR link.\n   If the implementation status is published separately from the\
    \ I-D,\n   then this information needs to be openly available without requiring\n\
    \   authentication, registration, or access controls if it is to have any\n  \
    \ useful effects.\n"
- title: 4.  Benefits
  contents:
  - "4.  Benefits\n   Publishing the information about implementations provides the\
    \ working\n   group with several benefits:\n   o  Working group members, chairs,\
    \ and ADs may use the information\n      provided to help prioritize the progress\
    \ of I-Ds, e.g., when there\n      are several competing proposals to solve a\
    \ particular problem.\n   o  Similarly, the information is useful when deciding\
    \ whether the\n      document should be progressed on a different track (individual\n\
    \      submission, Experimental, etc.).\n   o  Making this information public\
    \ and an explicit part of WG\n      deliberations will motivate participants to\
    \ implement protocol\n      proposals, which in turn helps in discovering protocol\
    \ flaws at an\n      early stage.\n   o  Other participants can use the software\
    \ to evaluate the usefulness\n      of protocol features, its correctness (to\
    \ some degree), and other\n      properties, such as resilience and scalability.\n\
    \   o  WG members may choose to perform interoperability testing with\n      known\
    \ implementations, especially when they are publicly\n      available.\n   o \
    \ In the case of open source, people may want to study the code to\n      better\
    \ understand the protocol and its limitations, determine if\n      the implementation\
    \ matches the protocol specification, and whether\n      the protocol specification\
    \ has omissions or ambiguities.\n   o  And lastly, some protocol features may\
    \ be hard to understand, and\n      for such features, the mere assurance that\
    \ they can be implemented\n      is beneficial.  We note though that code should\
    \ never be used in\n      lieu of a clear specification.\n   We do not specify\
    \ here whether and to what degree working groups are\n   expected to prefer proposals\
    \ that have \"running code\" associated with\n   them, over others that do not.\n"
- title: 5.  Process Experiment
  contents:
  - "5.  Process Experiment\n   The current proposal is proposed as an experiment.\
    \  The inclusion of\n   Implementation Status sections in Internet-Drafts is not\
    \ mandatory,\n   but the authors of this document wish to encourage authors of\
    \ other\n   Internet-Drafts to try out this simple mechanism to discover whether\n\
    \   it is useful.  Working group chairs are invited to suggest this\n   mechanism\
    \ to document editors in their working groups, and to draw\n   the attention of\
    \ their working group participants to Implementation\n   Status sections where\
    \ they exist.\n   Following a community discussion, it was concluded that [RFC3933]\
    \ is\n   not an appropriate framework for this experiment, primarily because\n\
    \   no change is required to any existing process.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Duration
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Duration\n   Given the typical time to produce an RFC (see [Stats]), we\
    \ propose a\n   duration of 18 months for the experiment.  Thus, 18 months after\
    \ the\n   date of publication of this document as an RFC, the authors will\n \
    \  report on the experiment as described in the next section.\n   I-D authors\
    \ are obviously free to include Implementation Status\n   sections in their documents\
    \ even after the experiment has concluded.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Summary Report
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Summary Report\n   The authors will summarize the results of the experiment\
    \ at the end\n   of the period assigned to the experiment (see Section 5.1). \
    \ If\n   nothing happens (no I-Ds or only a handful include an Implementation\n\
    \   Status section), an email to the IETF list will be sufficient.  This\n   would\
    \ obviously constitute a failure to adopt the idea and the\n   authors will abandon\
    \ the experiment.\n   If this idea is adopted by document authors, a summary I-D\
    \ will be\n   written containing the statistics of such adoption, as well as\n\
    \   (necessarily subjective) reports by working group members, chairs,\n   and\
    \ area directors who have used this mechanism.\n   The authors may then propose\
    \ more wide-scale use of the process and\n   might suggest more formal adoption\
    \ of the process by the IETF.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Success Criteria
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Success Criteria\n   The goal of this experiment is to improve the quality\
    \ of IETF\n   specifications.  This is impossible to quantify, of course.  We\n\
    \   suggest that generally positive answers to the following questions\n   would\
    \ indicate that the experiment was successful:\n   o  Did the working group make\
    \ decisions that were more informed when\n      comparing multiple competing solutions\
    \ for the same work item?\n   o  Did authors significantly modify proposed protocols\
    \ based on\n      implementation experience?\n   o  Did disclosure of implementations\
    \ encourage more interoperability\n      testing than previously?\n   o  Did non-authors\
    \ review documents based on interactions with\n      running code and/or inspection\
    \ of the code itself?\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This is a process document; therefore, it does\
    \ not have a direct\n   effect on the security of any particular IETF protocol.\
    \  However,\n   better-reviewed protocols are likely to also be more secure.\n"
