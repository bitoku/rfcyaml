  - "1.  Introduction\n   A set of metrics of packet-transport quality has been defined\
    \ by BT\n   for pre-standards use in its network.  These metrics are known as\n\
    \   \"XNQ\" for \"eXtended Network Quality\".  This document defines an\n   RTCP-XR\
    \ Report Block to transport the XNQ measures from an RTP end\n   system to its\
    \ peer, using the extension mechanism defined in [1].\n   The metrics are designed\
    \ to supplement the packet-loss metric in RTCP\n   [2] and the roundtrip delay\
    \ measurement provided by RTCP.  They\n   provide metrics for IP Packet Delay\
    \ Variation based on the IPDV\n   metric defined in [3], metrics reporting the\
    \ activity of the RTP end\n   system's receiver's jitter buffer, and metrics reporting\
    \ \"errored\"\n   and \"severely errored\" seconds.\n   This document has been\
    \ produced to describe the report block in\n   sufficient detail to register the\
    \ block type with IANA in accordance\n   with the Specification Required policy\
    \ of [1].  This specification\n   does not standardise the new report block for\
    \ use outside BT's\n   network.\n   Work in progress on RTCP HR [5] is likely\
    \ to obsolete these metrics\n   and the RTCP-XR Report Block defined here.\n"

  - "3.  Extended Network Quality (XNQ) Report Block\n   A set of metrics of packet-transport\
    \ quality has been defined by BT\n   for pre-standards use in its network.  These\
    \ metrics are known as\n   \"XNQ\" for \"eXtended Network Quality\".\n   This\
    \ document defines an RTCP-XR Report Block using the extension\n   mechanism defined\
    \ in [1].  The new Report Block provides transport of\n   the XNQ measures from\
    \ an RTP end system to its peer.\n   The metrics are described in the following\
    \ text.  However, some\n   additional explanation is required for the metrics\
    \ vmaxdiff, vrange,\n   vsum, and c, which measure aspects of packet delay variation.\
    \  The\n   metrics are based on the measure known as IP Packet Delay Variation\n\
    \   (IPDV) defined in [3].  The IPDV of a packet is the amount by which\n   the\
    \ packet was delayed in the network, minus the amount a reference\n   packet was\
    \ delayed in the network.  The reference packet is usually\n   the first packet\
    \ of the connection.  IPDV is a signed quantity.\n   The metric vrange is the\
    \ difference (longest minus shortest) between\n   the longest and shortest network\
    \ packet delays seen over the duration\n   of the connection to date.  The metric\
    \ vrange is usually a positive\n   quantity, but may be zero if the packet delay\
    \ is exactly constant\n   over the lifetime of the connection to date.\n   The\
    \ metric vmaxdiff is found as follows.  For each RTCP measurement\n   cycle, find\
    \ the difference (longest minus shortest) between the\n   longest and shortest\
    \ network packet delays within that measurement\n   cycle.  These differences\
    \ are usually all positive quantities, but a\n   difference may be zero if the\
    \ packet delay is exactly constant\n   throughout the measurement cycle.  Take\
    \ the set of these differences\n   and find the maximum, which is vmaxdiff.  The\
    \ metric vmaxdiff is also\n   usually a positive quantity, but will be zero if\
    \ all the members of\n   the set of per-cycle differences are zero.\n   The metric\
    \ vsum is simply the sum of the per-RTCP-cycle differences,\n   which were obtained\
    \ to find vmaxdiff as described above.  The metric\n   c is the number of per-RTCP-cycle\
    \ differences, that is, the\n   cardinality of the set of differences.  The two\
    \ metrics vsum and c\n   allow calculation of vsum/c, the average IPDV per RTCP\
    \ measurement\n   cycle.\n   The format of the report is as shown in Figure 1.\n\
