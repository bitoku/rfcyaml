  - "1.  Introduction\n   The \"amr\" (Authentication Methods References) claim is
    defined and\n   registered in the IANA \"JSON Web Token Claims\" registry\n   [IANA.JWT.Claims],
    but no standard Authentication Method Reference\n   values are currently defined.
    \ This specification establishes a\n   registry for Authentication Method Reference
    values and defines an\n   initial set of Authentication Method Reference values.\n
    \  For context, the \"amr\" (Authentication Methods References) claim is\n   defined
    by Section 2 of the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification\n   [OpenID.Core] as
    follows:\n   amr\n      OPTIONAL.  Authentication Methods References.  JSON array
    of\n      strings that are identifiers for authentication methods used in\n      the
    authentication.  For instance, values might indicate that both\n      password
    and OTP authentication methods were used.  The definition\n      of particular
    values to be used in the \"amr\" Claim is beyond the\n      scope of this specification.
    \ Parties using this claim will need\n      to agree upon the meanings of the
    values used, which may be\n      context-specific.  The \"amr\" value is an array
    of case sensitive\n      strings.\n   Typically, each \"amr\" value provides an
    identifier for a family of\n   closely related authentication methods.  For example,
    the \"otp\"\n   identifier intentionally covers OTPs (One-Time Passwords) based
    on\n   both time and HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code).  Many\n   relying
    parties will be content to know that an OTP has been used in\n   addition to a
    password; the distinction between which kind of OTP was\n   used is not useful
    to them.  Thus, there's a single identifier that\n   can be satisfied in two or
    more nearly equivalent ways.\n   Similarly, there's a whole range of nuances between
    different\n   fingerprint-matching algorithms.  They differ in false-positive
    and\n   false-negative rates over different population samples and also\n   differ
    based on the kind and model of fingerprint sensor used.  Like\n   the OTP case,
    many relying parties will be content to know that a\n   fingerprint match was
    made, without delving into and differentiating\n   based on every aspect of the
    implementation of fingerprint capture\n   and match.  The \"fpt\" identifier accomplishes
    this.\n   Ultimately, the relying party is depending upon the identity provider\n
    \  to do reasonable things.  If it does not trust the identity provider\n   to
    do so, it has no business using it.  The \"amr\" value lets the\n   identity provider
    signal to the relying party additional information\n   about what it did, for
    the cases in which that information is useful\n   to the relying party.\n   The
    \"amr\" values defined by this specification are not intended to be\n   an exhaustive
    set covering all use cases.  Additional values can and\n   will be added to the
    registry by other specifications.  Rather, the\n   values defined herein are an
    intentionally small set and are already\n   actually being used in practice.\n
    \  The values defined by this specification only make distinctions that\n   are
    known to be useful to relying parties.  Slicing things more\n   finely than would
    be used in practice would actually hurt\n   interoperability, rather than helping
    it, because it would force\n   relying parties to recognize that several or many
    different values\n   actually mean the same thing to them.\n   For context, while
    the claim values registered pertain to\n   authentication, note that OAuth 2.0
    [RFC6749] is designed for\n   resource authorization and cannot be used for authentication
    without\n   employing appropriate extensions, such as those defined by OpenID\n
    \  Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].  The existence of the \"amr\" claim and\n   values
    for it should not be taken as encouragement to try to use\n   OAuth 2.0 for authentication
    without employing extensions that enable\n   secure authentication to be performed.\n
    \  When used with OpenID Connect, if the identity provider supplies an\n   \"amr\"
    claim in the ID Token resulting from a successful\n   authentication, the relying
    party can inspect the values returned and\n   thereby learn details about how
    the authentication was performed.\n   For instance, the relying party might learn
    that only a password was\n   used or it might learn that iris recognition was
    used in combination\n   with a hardware-secured key.  Whether \"amr\" values are
    provided and\n   which values are understood by what parties are both beyond the
    scope\n   of this specification.  The OpenID Connect MODRNA Authentication\n   Profile
    1.0 [OpenID.MODRNA] is one example of an application context\n   that uses \"amr\"
    values defined by this specification.\n"

  - "3.  Relationship to \"acr\" (Authentication Context Class Reference)\n   The
    \"acr\" (Authentication Context Class Reference) claim and\n   \"acr_values\"
    request parameter are related to the \"amr\"\n   (Authentication Methods References)
    claim, but with important\n   differences.  An Authentication Context Class specifies
    a set of\n   business rules that authentications are being requested to satisfy.\n
    \  These rules can often be satisfied by using a number of different\n   specific
    authentication methods, either singly or in combination.\n   Interactions using
    \"acr_values\" request that the specified\n   Authentication Context Classes be
    used and that the result should\n   contain an \"acr\" claim saying which Authentication
    Context Class was\n   satisfied.  The \"acr\" claim in the reply states that the
    business\n   rules for the class were satisfied -- not how they were satisfied.\n
    \  In contrast, interactions using the \"amr\" claim make statements about\n   the
    particular authentication methods that were used.  This tends to\n   be more brittle
    than using \"acr\", since the authentication methods\n   that may be appropriate
    for a given authentication will vary over\n   time, both because of the evolution
    of attacks on existing methods\n   and the deployment of new authentication methods.\n"

  - "4.  Privacy Considerations\n   The list of \"amr\" claim values returned in an
    ID Token reveals\n   information about the way that the end user authenticated
    to the\n   identity provider.  In some cases, this information may have privacy\n
    \  implications.\n   While this specification defines identifiers for particular
    kinds of\n   credentials, it does not define how these credentials are stored
    or\n   protected.  For instance, ensuring the security and privacy of\n   biometric
    credentials that are referenced by some of the defined\n   Authentication Method
    Reference values is beyond the scope of this\n   specification.\n"

    Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core],\n   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], and the entire OAuth 2.0 Threat
    Model [RFC6819]\n   apply to applications using this specification.\n   As described
    in Section 3, taking a dependence upon particular\n   authentication methods may
    result in brittle systems since the\n   authentication methods that may be appropriate
    for a given\n   authentication will vary over time.\n"

    - "6.1.  Authentication Method Reference Values Registry\n   This specification
      establishes the IANA \"Authentication Method\n   Reference Values\" registry
      for \"amr\" claim array element values.  The\n   registry records the Authentication
      Method Reference value and a\n   reference to the specification that defines
      it.  This specification\n   registers the Authentication Method Reference values
      defined in\n   Section 2.\n   Values are registered on an Expert Review [RFC5226]
      basis after a\n   three-week review period on the <jwt-reg-review@ietf.org>
      mailing\n   list, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts.  To increase\n
      \  potential interoperability, the Designated Experts are requested to\n   encourage
      registrants to provide the location of a publicly\n   accessible specification
      defining the values being registered, so\n   that their intended usage can be
      more easily understood.\n   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for
      review should use\n   an appropriate subject (e.g., \"Request to register Authentication\n
      \  Method Reference value: otp\").\n   Within the review period, the Designated
      Experts will either approve\n   or deny the registration request, communicating
      this decision to the\n   review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation
      and, if\n   applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.\n
      \  Registration requests that are undetermined for a period longer than\n   21
      days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the\n   <iesg@ietf.org> mailing
      list) for resolution.\n   IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated
      Experts\n   and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing\n
      \  list.\n   It is suggested that the same Designated Experts evaluate these\n
      \  registration requests as those who evaluate registration requests for\n   the
      IANA \"JSON Web Token Claims\" registry [IANA.JWT.Claims].\n   Criteria that
      should be applied by the Designated Experts include\n   determining whether
      the proposed registration duplicates existing\n   functionality; whether it
      is likely to be of general applicability or\n   whether it is useful only for
      a single application; whether the value\n   is actually being used; and whether

    contain a single\n   Authentication Method Reference value.  For example, the
    following\n   \"amr\" claim value indicates that the authentication performed
    used an\n   iris scan biometric:\n     \"amr\": [\"iris\"]\n   In other cases,
    the \"amr\" claim value returned may contain multiple\n   Authentication Method
    Reference values.  For example, the following\n   \"amr\" claim value indicates
    that the authentication performed used a\n   password and knowledge-based authentication:\n
    \    \"amr\": [\"pwd\", \"kba\"]\n"
