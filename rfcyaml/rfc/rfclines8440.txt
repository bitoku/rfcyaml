Abstract This document defines an extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) LIST command that allows the client to request the set of rights that the logged in user has been granted on mailboxes, along with other information typically returned by the LIST command.
Introduction IMAP [RFC3501] clients typically fetch the set of rights granted on mailboxes so they can expose the allowed functionality to the logged  in user.
In order to do that, the client is forced to issue a LIST or LSUB command to list all available mailboxes, followed by a MYRIGHTS command for each mailbox found.
This document defines an extension to the to IMAP LIST command that is identified by the capability string "LIST MYRIGHTS".
The LIST MYRIGHTS extension allows the client to request the set of rights that the logged in user has been granted on mailboxes, along with other information typically returned by the LIST command.
Conventions Used in This Document
In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected to a server.
"S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
MYRIGHTS Return Option to LIST Command [RFC4314] defines the MYRIGHTS command, which is used by an IMAP client to determine the set of rights that the logged in user has been granted on a given mailbox.
Frequently, a client will have to look up the rights for some or all of the mailboxes returned by the LIST command.
Doing so in multiple MYRIGHTS commands wastes bandwidth and can degrade performance if the client does not pipeline the requests.
This document extends the LIST command with a new "MYRIGHTS" return option [RFC5258] that allows the client to request all of the desired information in a single command.
For each listable mailbox matching the list pattern and selection options, the server MUST return an untagged LIST response and SHOULD also return an untagged MYRIGHTS response containing the set of rights granted to the logged in user.
The ordering of the responses is significant only in that the server MUST NOT send a MYRIGHTS response for a given mailbox before it sends the LIST response for that mailbox.
If the server is unable to look up the set of rights for a given mailbox, it does not send the MYRIGHTS reply for that mailbox.
Client authors ought to note that generating the MYRIGHTS responses for a large number of mailboxes may be an expensive operation for the server.
Clients SHOULD use a suitable match pattern and/or selection option to limit the set of mailboxes returned to only those in whose rights they are interested.
In this example, the "bar" mailbox doesn't exist, so it has no MYRIGHTS reply.
"foo" S:   MYRIGHTS "foo" lrs S:
In this example, the LIST reply for the "foo" mailbox is returned because it has matching children, but no MYRIGHTS reply is returned, because "foo" itself doesn't match the selection criteria.
The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus Naur Form (BNF) as described in [RFC5234].
Terms not defined here are taken from [RFC5258].
In addition to the security considerations described in [RFC4314], this extension makes it a bit easier for clients to overload the server by requesting MYRIGHTS information for a large number of mailboxes.
However, as noted in the introduction, existing clients already try to do that by generating a large number of MYRIGHTS commands for each mailbox in which they are interested.
While performing MYRIGHTS information retrieval for big lists of mailboxes, a server implementation needs to make sure that it can still serve other IMAP connections and yield execution to other connections, when necessary.
This specification does not introduce any additional privacy concerns beyond those described in [RFC4314].
