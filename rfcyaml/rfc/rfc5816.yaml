  - "Abstract\n   This document updates RFC 3161.  It allows the use of ESSCertIDv2,
    as\n   defined in RFC 5035, to specify the hash of a signer certificate when\n
    \  the hash is calculated with a function other than the Secure Hash\n   Algorithm
    (SHA-1).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The time-stamping protocol defined in RFC 3161 [RFC3161]
    requires\n   that the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) SignedData [RFC5652],\n
    \  used to apply a digital signature on the time-stamp token, include a\n   signed
    attribute that identifies the signer's certificate.\n   This identifier only allows
    SHA-1 [SHA1] to be used as the hash\n   algorithm to generate the identifier value.\n
    \  The mechanism used in [RFC3161] employed ESSCertID from RFC 2634\n   [ESS].
    \ RFC 5035 [ESSV2] updated ESSCertID with ESSCertIDv2 to allow\n   the use of
    any hash algorithm.\n   The changes to RFC 3161 [RFC3161] defined in this document
    allow\n   ESSCertIDv2 to be used to include an identifier of the signing\n   certificate
    as defined in RFC 5035 [ESSV2].\n"

        before the definition of TSTInfo.\n   Old:\n      The time-stamp token MUST
        NOT contain any signatures other than\n      the signature of the TSA.  The
        certificate identifier (ESSCertID)\n      of the TSA certificate MUST be included

        \     Note: As mentioned in RFC 5035 [ESSV2], the SigningCertificateV2\n            attribute

        RFC 5035, both\n            ESSCertID and ESSCertIDv2 MAY be present.  Systems
        MAY\n            ignore ESSCertIDv2 if RFC 5035 has not been implemented.\n"

    of RFC 5035\n   [ESSV2] with further explanations in this section.\n   ESSCertID
    provides a means based on the SHA-1 hash algorithm for\n   identifying the certificate
    used to verify the signature on a time\n   stamp.  The use of ESSCertIDv2 aims
    to enable implementers to comply\n   with policies that require phasing out all
    uses of the SHA-1\n   algorithm.\n   The update provided by this document is motivated
    by reasons of\n   interoperability and migration to other hash algorithms rather
    than\n   mitigating new security issues.\n"
