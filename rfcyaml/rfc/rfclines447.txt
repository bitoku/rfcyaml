IMP/TIP Memory Retrofit Schedule (Revision 1)
This revision contains two major changes to RFC #434.
First, all retrofits scheduled prior to February first have been completed and are therefore removed from the schedule.
Second, the CCA retrofit has been rescheduled from 3/20 to 2/28.
The revised text of RFC # 434 follows:
During the first several month of 1973 we will be retrofitting each IMP and TIP with additional core memory.
At the end of the retrofit program, the memory sizes of the various machines will be as follows:
28K words TIP with Magnetic Tape Option
In addition, the expansion of the TIP core memory will necessitate enlarging the TIP to two cabinets.
Listed below is the schedule for the remaining retrofits.
We have arranged this schedule to coincide with usual monthly Preventive Maintenance at each site so as to minimize user inconvenience, but the work required will frequently require the machines to be down longer than normal.
I will issue additional RFC's updating this schedule as necessary.
Any site which anticipates difficulty with the expansion of TIP size, and thus the floor space requirement, should contact Hawley Rising (BBN) at (617) 491 1850 ext.
All dates given below are in the form (month/day) Utah (2/1) UCSB (
(2/22) Case (2/26) CCA (2/28) SRI (3/7)
Rome (3/14) FNWC (3/15) UCLA (3/19)
