  - "1.  Overview\n   DS-Lite [RFC6333] is a transition technique that enables operators\
    \ to\n   multiplex public IPv4 addresses while provisioning only IPv6 to\n   users.\
    \  DS-Lite is designed to continue offering IPv4 services while\n   operators\
    \ upgrade their networks incrementally to IPv6.  DS-Lite\n   combines IPv4-in-IPv6\
    \ softwire [RFC2473] and Network Address\n   Translator IPv4/IPv4 (NAT44) [RFC3022]\
    \ to enable more than one user\n   to share a public IPv4 address.\n   While Appendix\
    \ A of [RFC6333] explains how to deploy DS-Lite within\n   specific scenarios,\
    \ the purpose of this document is to describe\n   problems that arise when deploying\
    \ DS-Lite and what guidance should\n   be taken to mitigate those issues.  The\
    \ information is based on real\n   deployment experience and is compiled in one\
    \ comprehensive document\n   so that operators aren't required to search through\
    \ various RFCs\n   deciding which sections are applicable and impact their DS-Lite\n\
    \   deployment.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Interface Consideration
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Interface Consideration\n   Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) is\
    \ a network element that is\n   deployed inside the operator's network.  An AFTR\
    \ can be a stand-alone\n   device or be embedded into a router.  The AFTR is the\
    \ IPv4-in-IPv6\n   tunnel termination point and the NAT44 device.  It is deployed\
    \ at the\n   IPv4-IPv6 network border where the tunnel interface is IPv6 and the\n\
    \   external NAT44 interface is IPv4.  The Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4)\n   element\
    \ [RFC6333] is a function implemented on a dual-stack-capable\n   node (either\
    \ a host device or a home gateway) that creates a tunnel\n   to an AFTR.  Although\
    \ an operator can configure both softwire tunnel\n   termination and interface\
    \ for NAT44 functions on a single physical\n   interface (yet, keep them logically\
    \ separated), there are scenarios\n   we recommend to configure two individual\
    \ interfaces (i.e., one\n   dedicated for IPv4 and one dedicated for IPv6) to\
    \ segregate the\n   functions.\n   o  The access network between the B4 and AFTR\
    \ is an IPv6-only\n      network, and the network between the AFTR and IPv4 network\
    \ is an\n      IPv4-only network.  In this deployment scenario, the AFTR\n   \
    \   interface to the IPv6-only network and the interface to the IPv4\n      network\
    \ should use two physical interfaces on the AFTR.\n   o  Operators may use Operations\
    \ Support System (OSS) tools (e.g.,\n      Multi Router Traffic Grapher) to collect\
    \ interface data packet\n      count information.  If an operator wants to separate\
    \ the softwire\n      function and NAT44 function on different physical interfaces\
    \ for\n      collecting a data packet count, and the AFTR does not support\n \
    \     packet count for logical interfaces, they should use two physical\n    \
    \  interfaces on the AFTR.\n"
- title: 2.2.  MTU and Fragmentation Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.2.  MTU and Fragmentation Considerations\n   DS-Lite is part tunneling protocol.\
    \  Tunneling introduces overhead to\n   the packet and decreases the effective\
    \ MTU size after encapsulation.\n   DS-Lite users may experience problems with\
    \ applications such as not\n   being able to download Internet pages or transfer\
    \ large files.\n   Since fragmentation and reassembly is not optimal, the operator\n\
    \   should do everything possible to eliminate the need for it.  If the\n   operator\
    \ uses simple IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire [RFC2473], it is\n   recommended that the\
    \ MTU size of the IPv6 network between the B4 and\n   the AFTR accounts for the\
    \ additional overhead (40 bytes).  If the\n   access network MTU size is fixed\
    \ and cannot be changed, the operator\n   should be aware that the B4 and the\
    \ AFTR must support fragmentation\n   as defined in [RFC6333].  The operator should\
    \ also be aware that\n   reassembly at the Tunnel Exit-Point is resource intensive\
    \ as a large\n   number of B4 may terminate on the same AFTR.  Scalability of\
    \ the AFTR\n   is advised in this scenario.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Logging at the AFTR
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Logging at the AFTR\n   A source-specific log is essential for backtracking\
    \ specific hosts\n   when a problem is identified with one of the AFTR's NAT-ed\
    \ addresses.\n   The source-specific log contains the B4 IPv6 source address,\n\
    \   transport protocol, source port, and source IPv4 address after it has\n  \
    \ been NAT-ed.  Using the source-specific log, operators can uniquely\n   identify\
    \ a specific host when a DS-Lite host experiences problems\n   accessing the IPv4\
    \ network.  To maximize IPv4 shared ratio, an\n   operator may configure a short\
    \ timeout value for NAT44 entries.  This\n   will result in a large number of\
    \ logs created by the AFTR.  For\n   operators who desire to aggregate the logs,\
    \ they can configure the\n   AFTR to preallocate a range of ports to each B4.\
    \  This range of ports\n   will be used in the NAT44 function, and the AFTR will\
    \ create one log\n   entry for the whole port range.  This aggregation can significantly\n\
    \   reduce the log size for source-specific logging.\n   Some operators may require\
    \ logging both source and destination\n   information for a host's connections.\
    \  This is called a destination-\n   specific log.  A destination-specific log\
    \ contains the B4's IPv6\n   address, transport protocol, source port, source\
    \ IPv4 address after\n   it has been NAT-ed, destination port, and destination\
    \ IPv4 address.\n   A destination-specific log is session-based; the operators\
    \ should be\n   aware that they will not be able to aggregate log entries.  When\n\
    \   using a destination-specific log, the operator must be careful of the\n  \
    \ large number of log entries created by the AFTR.  Some AFTR\n   implementations\
    \ may keep the logs in their main memory.  This may be\n   CPU and memory resource\
    \ intensive.  The operators should configure\n   the AFTR to periodically send\
    \ logs to storage facility and then purge\n   them from the AFTR.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Blacklisting a Shared IPv4 Address
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Blacklisting a Shared IPv4 Address\n   The AFTR is a NAT device.  It enables\
    \ multiple B4s to share a single\n   public IPv4 address.  [RFC6269] discusses\
    \ some considerations when\n   sharing an IPv4 address.  When a public IPv4 address\
    \ is blacklisted\n   by a remote peer, this may affect multiple users or hosts.\
    \  Operators\n   deploying DS-Lite should be aware that Internet hosts may not\
    \ be\n   aware that a given single IPv4 address is actually shared by multiple\n\
    \   B4s.  A content provider might block services for a shared IPv4\n   address\
    \ and this would then impact all B4s sharing this particular\n   IPv4 address.\
    \  The operator would be likely to receive calls related\n   to service outage\
    \ and would then need to take appropriate corrective\n   actions.  [RFC6302] describes\
    \ necessary information required to\n   identify a user or host in shared address\
    \ environment.  It is also\n   worth mention that [NAT-REVEAL] analyses different\
    \ approaches to\n   identify a user or host in a shared address environment.\n"
- title: 2.5.  AFTR's Policies
  contents:
  - "2.5.  AFTR's Policies\n   There are two types of AFTR policies:\n   o  Outgoing\
    \ Policies apply to packets originating from B4 to the\n      AFTR.  These policies\
    \ should be provisioned on the AFTR's IPv6\n      interface that is connected\
    \ to the B4s.\n   o  Incoming Policies apply to packets originating from IPv4\
    \ networks\n      to B4s.  These policies should be provisioned on the IPv4\n\
    \      interface connected to the IPv4 network.\n"
- title: 2.5.1.  Outgoing Policy
  contents:
  - "2.5.1.  Outgoing Policy\n   Outgoing Policies may include Access Control List\
    \ (ACL) and Quality\n   of Service (QoS) settings.  These policies control the\
    \ packets from\n   B4s to the AFTR.  For example, the operator may configure the\
    \ AFTR\n   only to accept B4 connections that originated from specific IPv6\n\
    \   prefixes configured in the AFTR.  More discussion of this use case\n   can\
    \ be found in Section 2.12.  An operator may configure the AFTR to\n   give priority\
    \ to the packets marked by certain Differentiated\n   Services Code Point (DSCP)\
    \ values [RFC2475].  Furthermore, an AFTR\n   may also apply an Outgoing Policy\
    \ to limit the rate of port\n   allocation for a single B4's IPv6 address.\n \
    \  Some operators offer different service level agreements (SLAs) to\n   users\
    \ to meet their requirements.  Some users may require more ports\n   and some\
    \ may require different service priority.  In this deployment\n   scenario, the\
    \ operator can implement Outgoing Policies specified to a\n   user's B4 or a group\
    \ of B4s sharing the same policies.\n"
- title: 2.5.2.  Incoming Policy
  contents:
  - "2.5.2.  Incoming Policy\n   Similar to the Outgoing Policy, an Incoming Policy\
    \ may also include\n   ACL and QoS settings.  The Outgoing Policy controls packets\
    \ coming\n   from the IPv4 network to the B4s.  Incoming packets are normally\n\
    \   treated equally, so these policies are globally applied.  For\n   example,\
    \ an operator wants to use a predefined DSCP value to signal\n   the IPv6 access\
    \ network to apply certain traffic policies.  In this\n   deployment scenario,\
    \ the operator can configure the AFTR to mark the\n   incoming packets with the\
    \ predefined DSCP value.  This policy will\n   apply to all incoming packets from\
    \ the IPv4 network.\n"
- title: 2.6.  AFTR Impacts on Accounting Process
  contents:
  - "2.6.  AFTR Impacts on Accounting Process\n   This section discusses IPv4 and\
    \ IPv6 traffic accounting in the\n   DS-Lite environment.  In a typical broadband\
    \ access scenario (e.g.,\n   DSL or Cable), the B4 is embedded in a Residential\
    \ Gateway.  The edge\n   router for the B4s in the provider's network is an IPv6\
    \ edge router.\n   The edge router is usually responsible for IPv6 accounting\
    \ and the\n   user management functions such as authentication, authorization,\
    \ and\n   accounting (AAA).  However, given the fact that IPv4 traffic is\n  \
    \ encapsulated in an IPv6 packet at the B4 and only decapsulated at the\n   AFTR,\
    \ the edge router will require additional functionality to\n   associate IPv4\
    \ accounting information to the B4 IPv6 address.  If\n   DS-Lite is the only application\
    \ using the IPv4-in-IPv6 protocol in\n   the IPv6 access network, the operator\
    \ can configure the edge router\n   to check the IPv6 Next Header field in the\
    \ IPv6 header, identify the\n   protocol type (i.e., 0x04), and collect IPv4 accounting\
    \ information.\n   Alternatively, the AFTR may perform accounting for IPv4 traffic.\n\
    \   However, operators must be aware that this will introduce some\n   challenges,\
    \ especially in DSL deployment.  In DSL deployment, the AAA\n   transaction normally\
    \ happens between the edge router (i.e., Broadband\n   Network Gateway) and AAA\
    \ server.  [RFC6333] does not require the AFTR\n   to interact with the AAA server\
    \ or edge router.  Thus, the AFTR may\n   not have the AAA parameters (e.g., Account\
    \ Session ID) associated\n   with B4s to generate an IPv4 accounting record. \
    \ IPv4 traffic\n   accounting at the AFTR is not recommended when the AAA parameters\n\
    \   necessary to generate complete IPv4 accounting records are not\n   available.\
    \  The accounting process at the AFTR is only necessary if\n   the operator requires\
    \ separating per-B4 accounting records for IPv4\n   and IPv6 traffic.  If the\
    \ per-B4 IPv6 accounting records, collected\n   by the edge router, are sufficient,\
    \ then the additional complexity of\n   enabling IPv4 accounting at the AFTR is\
    \ not required.  It is\n   important to notice that, since the IPv4 traffic is\
    \ encapsulated in\n   IPv6 packets, the data collected by the edge router for\
    \ IPv6 traffic\n   already contains the total amount of traffic (i.e., IPv4 and\
    \ IPv6).\n   Even if detailed accounting records collection for IPv4 traffic may\n\
    \   not be required, it would be useful for an operator, in some\n   scenarios,\
    \ to have information that the edge router generates for the\n   IPv6 traffic.\
    \  This information can be used to identify the AFTR who\n   is handling the IPv4\
    \ traffic for that B4.  This can be achieved by\n   adding additional information\
    \ to the IPv6 accounting records.  For\n   example, operators can use RADIUS attribute\
    \ information specified in\n   [RFC6519] or a new attribute to be specified in\
    \ Internet Protocol\n   Detailed Record (IPDR).\n"
- title: 2.7.  Reliability Considerations of AFTR
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Reliability Considerations of AFTR\n   For robustness, reliability, and\
    \ load distribution purposes,\n   operators may deploy multiple AFTRs.  In such\
    \ cases, the IPv6\n   prefixes and algorithm to build the tunneling mechanisms\
    \ configured\n   on each of these AFTRs will be the same.  In [RFC6333], Appendix\
    \ A.3\n   mentions that High Availability (HA) is the operator's\n   responsibility.\
    \  Since DS-Lite is a stateful mechanism, all\n   requirements for load-balancing\
    \ and failover mechanisms apply.  There\n   are many ways to implement HA in a\
    \ stateful mechanism; the most\n   common are Cold Standby mode and Hot Standby\
    \ mode.  More discussion\n   on deploying these two modes for NAT can be found\
    \ in [NAT-STANDBY].\n   In Cold Standby mode, the AFTR states are not replicated\
    \ from the\n   Primary AFTR to the Backup AFTR.  When the Primary AFTR fails,\
    \ all\n   the existing established sessions will be flushed out.  The internal\n\
    \   hosts are required to reestablish sessions with the external hosts.\n   In\
    \ Hot Standby mode, the session's states are replicated on-the-fly\n   from the\
    \ Primary AFTR to the Backup AFTR.  When the Primary AFTR\n   fails, the Backup\
    \ AFTR will take over all the existing established\n   sessions.  In this mode,\
    \ the internal hosts are not required to\n   reestablish sessions with the external\
    \ hosts.\n   For operators, the decision to use Cold Standby mode or Hot Standby\n\
    \   mode depends on the trade-off between capital cost and operational\n   cost.\
    \  Cold Standby mode does not require a Backup Standby AFTR to\n   synchronize\
    \ session states.  This simplifies the operational model.\n   When the Primary\
    \ AFTR goes down, any AFTR with extra capacity can\n   take over.  Hot Standby\
    \ mode provides a smoother failover experience\n   to users; the cost for the\
    \ operators is more careful failover\n   planning.  For most deployment scenarios,\
    \ we believe that Cold\n   Standby mode should be sufficient enough and is thus\
    \ recommended.\n"
- title: 2.8.  Strategic Placement of AFTR
  contents:
  - "2.8.  Strategic Placement of AFTR\n   In the DS-Lite environment, the AFTR is\
    \ the logical next-hop router\n   of the B4s to access the IPv4 network, so the\
    \ placement of the AFTR\n   will affect the traffic flows in the access network\
    \ and overall\n   network design.  In general, there are two placement models\
    \ to deploy\n   an AFTR.  Model One deploys the AFTR at the edge of the network\
    \ to\n   cover a small region.  Model Two deploys the AFTR at the core of the\n\
    \   network to cover a large region.\n   When an operator considers where to deploy\
    \ the AFTR, the operator\n   must make trade-offs.  The AFTR in Model One serves\
    \ fewer B4s; thus,\n   it requires a less powerful AFTR.  Moreover, the traffic\
    \ flows are\n   more evenly distributed to the AFTRs.  However, it requires deploying\n\
    \   more AFTRs to cover the entire network.  Often, the operation cost\n   increases\
    \ proportionally with the amount of network equipment.\n   The AFTR in Model Two\
    \ covers a larger area; thus, it serves more B4s.\n   The operator could deploy\
    \ only a few AFTRs to support the entire user\n   base.  However, this model requires\
    \ a more powerful AFTR to sustain\n   the load at peak hours.  Since the AFTR\
    \ would support B4s from\n   different regions, the AFTR would be deployed closer\
    \ to the core\n   network.\n   DS-Lite framework can be incrementally deployed.\
    \  An operator may\n   consider starting with Model Two.  When the demand increases,\
    \ the\n   operator can push the AFTR closer to the edge, which would\n   effectively\
    \ become Model One.\n"
- title: 2.9.  AFTR Considerations for Geographically Aware Services
  contents:
  - "2.9.  AFTR Considerations for Geographically Aware Services\n   By centralizing\
    \ public IPv4 addresses in the AFTR, remote services\n   can no longer rely on\
    \ an IPv4 address and IPv4 routing information to\n   derive a host's geographical\
    \ information.  For example, the IPv6\n   access network and the AFTR may be in\
    \ two different cities.  If the\n   remote services rely on the IPv4 address to\
    \ locate a host, they may\n   have thought the host was in a different city. \
    \ [RFC6269] Section 7\n   describes the problem in more detail.  Applications\

    \ code or\n   telephone number, before offering geographical service.  In contrast,\n\
    \   applications could use HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)\n   [RFC5985]\

- title: 2.10.  Impacts on QoS Policy
  contents:
  - "2.10.  Impacts on QoS Policy\n   This section describes the application of [RFC2983]\
    \ to the DS-Lite\n   deployment model.  Operators must ensure that the QoS policy\
    \ that is\n   in place operates properly within the DS-Lite deployment.  In this\n\
    \   regard, operators commonly use DSCP [RFC2475] to classify and\n   prioritize\
    \ different types of traffic in their networks.  DS-Lite\n   tunnel can be seen\
    \ as a particular case of uniform conceptual tunnel\n   model, as described in\
    \ Section 3.1 of [RFC2983].  The uniform model\n   views an IP tunnel only as\
    \ a necessary mechanism to forward traffic\n   to its destination: the tunnel\
    \ has no significant impact on traffic\n   conditioning.  In this model, any packet\
    \ has exactly one DSCP field\n   that is used for traffic conditioning at any\
    \ point, and it is the\n   field in the outermost IP header.  In the DS-Lite model,\
    \ this is the\n   Traffic Class field in the IPv6 header.  According to [RFC2983],\n\
    \   implementations of this model copy the DSCP value to the outer IP\n   header\
    \ at encapsulation and copy the outer header's DSCP value to the\n   inner IP\
    \ header at decapsulation.\n   Operators should use this model by provisioning\
    \ the network such that\n   the AFTR copies the DSCP value in the IPv4 header\
    \ to the Traffic\n   Class field in the IPv6 header, after the encapsulation for\
    \ the\n   downstream traffic.  Similarly, the B4 copies the DSCP value in the\n\
    \   IPv4 header to the Traffic Class field to the IPv6 header, after the\n   encapsulation\
    \ for the upstream traffic.  Traffic identification and\n   classification can\
    \ be done by examining the outer IPv6 header in the\n   IPv6 access network.\n"

    \ know both the\n   NAT-ed IPv4 address used by the B4 and the IPv4 destination\
    \ port.\n   Some applications use Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) (e.g., popular\n\
    \   gaming consoles) or Interactive Community Establishment (ICE)\n   [RFC5245]\
    \ to request incoming ports.  Some applications rely on\n   Application Level\
    \ Gateway (ALG) or manual port configuration to\n   reserve a port in the NAT.\
    \  For the DS-Lite deployment scenario\n   whereby the B4 does not own a full\
    \ IPv4 address, the operator will\n   manage port-forwarding in the serving AFTR.\
    \  Operators may use Port\n   Control Protocol (PCP) [PCP-BASE] as guidance to\
    \ provide port\n   forwarding service.  Operators will deploy PCP client in the\
    \ B4s.\n   PCP permits the PCP server to be deployed in a stand-alone server.\n\
    \   However, we recommend that operators consider deploying the PCP\n   server\
    \ in the AFTR.  This will ease the overhead to design a global\n   configuration\
    \ for the PCP server for many AFTRs because each PCP\n   server will be dedicated\
    \ to the collocated AFTR.\n   When sharing an IPv4 address, not all of the ports\
    \ are available to a\n   B4.  Some restricted ports (i.e., 0-1023) are well known\
    \ such as TCP\n   port 25 and 80.  Many users may want to be provisioned with\
    \ the\n   restricted ports.  For fairness, we recommend that operators\n   configure\
    \ the AFTR and not allocate the restricted ports to regular\n   DS-Lite B4s. \
    \ This operation model ensures that DS-Lite B4s will have\n   uniform configuration,\
    \ which can simplify provisioning and operation.\n   For users who want to use\
    \ the restricted ports, operators can\n   consider provisioning a full IPv4 address\
    \ to those users' B4s.  If an\n   operator still wants to provision restricted\
    \ ports to specific B4s,\n   it may require implementing a static B4's configuration\
    \ in the AFTR\n   to match the B4's IPv6 address to the NAT rules.  Alternatively,\
    \ the\n   B4 may dynamically allocate the ports, and the AFTR authenticates the\n\
    \   session's request using PCP [PCP-BASE].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.12.  DS-Lite Tunnel Security\n   [RFC6333], Section 11 describes security issues\
    \ associated with the\n   DS-Lite mechanism.  To restrict the service offered\
    \ by the AFTR only\n   to registered B4s, an operator can implement the Outgoing\
    \ Policy on\n   the AFTR's tunnel interface to accept only the IPv6 prefixes defined\n\
    \   in the policy.  For static provisioning, the operator will need to\n   know\
    \ in advance the IPv6 prefixes provisioned to the B4s for the\n   softwire in\
    \ order to configure the policy.  To simplify operation,\n   operators should\
    \ configure the AFTRs in the same region with the same\n   IPv6 prefixes' Outgoing\
    \ Policy.  The AFTRs will accept both regular\n   connections and failover connections\
    \ from the B4s in the same service\n   region.\n"
- title: 2.13.  IPv6-Only Network Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.13.  IPv6-Only Network Considerations\n   In environments where the operator\
    \ wants to deploy the AFTR in an\n   IPv6-only network, the AFTR nodes may not\
    \ have direct IPv4\n   connectivity.  In this scenario, the operator extends the\
    \ IPv6-only\n   boundary to the border of the network and only the border routers\n\
    \   have IPv4 connectivity.  For both scalability and performance\n   purposes,\
    \ the AFTR is located in the IPv6-only network closer to B4s.\n   In this scenario,\
    \ the AFTR has only IPv6 connectivity and must be\n   able to send and receive\
    \ IPv4 packets.  Enhancements to the DS-Lite\n   AFTR are required to achieve\
    \ this.  [DS-LITE] describes such issues\n   and enhancements to DS-Lite in IPv6-only\
    \ deployments.\n"
- title: 3.  B4 Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  B4 Deployment Considerations\n   In order to configure the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel,\
    \ the B4 needs the IPv6\n   address of the AFTR.  This IPv6 address can be configured\
    \ using a\n   variety of methods ranging from an out-of-band mechanism, manual\n\
    \   configuration, and DHCPv6 option to RADIUS.  If an operator uses\n   DHCPv6\
    \ to provision the B4, the B4 must implement the DHCPv6 option\n   defined in\
    \ [RFC6334].  If an operator uses RADIUS to provision the\n   B4, the B4 must\
    \ implement [RFC6519].\n"
- title: 3.1.  DNS Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  DNS Deployment Considerations\n   [RFC6333] recommends that the B4 send\
    \ DNS queries to an external\n   recursive resolver over IPv6.  The B4 should\
    \ implement a proxy\n   resolver that will proxy a DNS query from IPv4 transport\
    \ to the DNS\n   server in the IPv6 network.  [RFC6333] does not describe the\
    \ DNS\n   proxy behavior.  In deployment, the operator must ensure that the DNS\n\
    \   proxy implementation must follow [RFC5625].  This is important\n   especially\
    \ for operators who have deployed, or will consider\n   deploying, DNSSEC [RFC4035].\n\
    \   Some operators may want to give hosts behind the B4 an IPv4 address\n   of\
    \ an external DNS recursive resolver.  The B4 will treat the DNS\n   packets as\
    \ normal IP packets and forward them over the softwire.\n   Note that there is\
    \ no effective way to provision an IPv4 DNS address\n   to the B4 over IPv6; operators\
    \ who use this DNS deployment model must\n   be aware that how to provision an\
    \ IPv4 DNS address over an IPv6\n   network is undefined, so it will introduce\
    \ additional complexity in\n   B4 provisioning.  Moreover, this will increase\
    \ the load to the AFTR\n   by creating entries in the NAT table for DNS sessions.\
    \  Operators may\n   deploy a local DNS caching resolver in the AFTR to reduce\
    \ the load in\n   the NAT table.  Nonetheless, this DNS model is not covered in\n\
    \   [RFC6333] and is not recommended.\n"
