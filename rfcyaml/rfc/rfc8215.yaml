  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document reserves 64:ff9b:1::/48 for local use within
    domains\n   that enable IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms.  This facilitates the\n
    \  coexistence of multiple IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms in the same\n   network
    without requiring the use of a Network-Specific Prefix\n   assigned from the operator's
    allocated global unicast address space.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This document uses the following terms:\n   Network-Specific
    Prefix (NSP)\n      A globally unique prefix assigned by a network operator for
    use\n      with an IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanism [RFC6052].\n   Well-Known Prefix
    (WKP)\n      The prefix 64:ff9b::/96, which is reserved for use with the\n      [RFC6052]
    IPv4/IPv6 address translation algorithms.\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Problem Statement\n   Since the WKP 64:ff9b::/96 was reserved by [RFC6052],
    several new\n   IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms have been defined by the IETF,
    such\n   as those defined in [RFC6146] and [RFC7915].  These mechanisms target\n
    \  various different use cases.  An operator might therefore wish to\n   make
    use of several of them simultaneously.\n   The WKP is reserved specifically for
    use with the algorithms\n   specified in [RFC6052].  More recent RFCs describe
    IPv4/IPv6\n   translation mechanisms that use different algorithms.  An operator\n
    \  deploying such mechanisms cannot make use of the WKP in a legitimate\n   fashion.\n
    \  Also, because the WKP is a /96, an operator preferring to use the WKP\n   over
    an NSP can do so for only one of their IPv4/IPv6 translation\n   mechanisms.  All
    others must necessarily use an NSP.\n   Section 3.1 of [RFC6052] imposes certain
    restrictions on the use of\n   the WKP, such as forbidding its use in combination
    with private IPv4\n   addresses [RFC1918].  These restrictions might conflict
    with the\n   operator's desired use of an IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanism.\n   In
    summary, there is a need for a local-use prefix that facilitates\n   the coexistence
    of multiple IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms in a\n   single network domain, as
    well as the deployment of translation\n   mechanisms that do not use the [RFC6052]
    algorithms or adhere to its\n   usage restrictions.\n"

    '
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Prefix Length\n   One of the primary goals of this document is to facilitate
      multiple\n   simultaneous deployments of IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanisms in
      a\n   single network.  The first criterion is therefore that the prefix\n   length
      chosen must be shorter than the prefix length used by any\n   individual translation
      mechanism.\n   The second criterion is that the prefix length chosen is a multiple\n
      \  of 16.  This ensures the prefix ends on a colon boundary when\n   representing
      it in text, easing operator interaction with it.\n   The [RFC6052] algorithms
      specifies IPv4/IPv6 translation prefixes as\n   short as /32.  In order to facilitate
      multiple instances of\n   translation mechanisms using /32s, while at the same
      time aligning on\n   a 16-bit boundary, it would be necessary to reserve a /16.
      \ Doing so,\n   however, was considered as too wasteful by the IPv6 Operations\n
      \  Working Group.\n   The shortest translation prefix that was reported to the
      IPv6\n   Operations Working Group as being deployed in a live network was /64.\n
      \  The longest 16-bit-aligned prefix length that can accommodate\n   multiple
      instances of /64 is /48.  The prefix length of /48 was\n   therefore chosen,
      as it satisfies both the criteria above, while at\n   the same time avoids wasting
      too much of the IPv6 address space.\n"
    title: 4.1.  Prefix Length
  - contents:
    - "4.2.  Prefix Value\n   It is desirable to minimise the amount of additional
      \"pollution\" in\n   the unallocated IPv6 address space caused by the reservation
      made by\n   this document.  Ensuring the reserved prefix is adjacent to the\n
      \  64:ff9b::/96 WKP already reserved by [RFC6052] accomplishes this.\n   Given
      the previous decision to use a prefix length of /48, this\n   leaves two options:
      64:ff9a:ffff::/48 and 64:ff9b:1::/48.\n   64:ff9a:ffff::/48 has the benefit
      that it is completely adjacent to\n   the [RFC6052] WKP.  That is, 64:ff9a:ffff::/48
      and 64:ff9b::/96\n   combine to form an uninterrupted range of IPv6 addresses
      starting\n   with 64:ff9a:ffff:: and ending with 64:ff9b::ffff:ffff.\n   64:ff9b:1::/48
      is, on the other hand, not completely adjacent to\n   64:ff9b::/96.  The range
      starting with 64:ff9b::1:0:0 and ending with\n   64:ff9b:0:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
      would remain unallocated.\n   This particular drawback is, however, balanced
      by the fact that the\n   smallest possible aggregate prefix that covers both
      the [RFC6052] WKP\n   and 64:ff9a:ffff::/48 is much larger than the smallest
      possible\n   aggregate prefix that covers both the [RFC6052] WKP and\n   64:ff9b:1::/48.
      \ These aggregate prefixes are 64:ff9a::/31 and\n   64:ff9b::/47, respectively.
      \ IPv6 address space is allocated using\n   prefixes rather than address ranges,
      so it could be argued that\n   64:ff9b:1::/48 is the option that would cause
      special-use prefixes\n   reserved for IPv4/IPv6 translation to \"pollute\" the
      minimum possible\n   amount of unallocated IPv6 address space.\n   Finally,
      64:ff9b:1::/48 also has the advantage that its textual\n   representation is
      shorter than 64:ff9a:ffff::/48.  While this might\n   seem insignificant, the
      preference human network operators have for\n   addresses that are simple to
      type should not be underestimated.\n   After weighing the above pros and cons,
      64:ff9b:1::/48 was chosen.\n"
    title: 4.2.  Prefix Value
  title: 4.  Why 64:ff9b:1::/48?
- contents:
  - "5.  Deployment Considerations\n   64:ff9b:1::/48 is intended as a technology-agnostic
    and generic\n   reservation.  A network operator may freely use it in combination\n
    \  with any kind of IPv4/IPv6 translation mechanism deployed within\n   their
    network.\n   By default, IPv6 nodes and applications must not treat IPv6 addresses\n
    \  within 64:ff9b:1::/48 differently from other globally scoped IPv6\n   addresses.
    \ In particular, they must not make any assumptions\n   regarding the syntax or
    properties of those addresses (e.g., the\n   existence and location of embedded
    IPv4 addresses) or the type of\n   associated translation mechanism (e.g., whether
    it is stateful or\n   stateless).\n   64:ff9b:1::/48 or any more-specific prefix
    may only be used in inter-\n   domain routing if done in accordance with the rules
    described in\n   Section 3.2 of [RFC6052].\n   Note that 64:ff9b:1::/48 (or any
    more-specific prefix) is distinct\n   from the WKP 64:ff9b::/96.  Therefore, the
    restrictions on the use of\n   the WKP described in Section 3.1 of [RFC6052] do
    not apply to the use\n   of 64:ff9b:1::/48.\n   Operators tempted to use the covering
    aggregate prefix 64:ff9b::/47\n   to refer to all special-use prefixes currently
    reserved for IPv4/IPv6\n   translation should be warned that this aggregate includes
    a range of\n   unallocated addresses (see Section 4.2) that the IETF could\n   potentially
    reserve in the future for entirely different purposes.\n"
  title: 5.  Deployment Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  Checksum Neutrality\n   Use of 64:ff9b:1::/48 does not in itself guarantee
    checksum\n   neutrality, as many of the IPv4/IPv6 translation algorithms it can
    be\n   used with are fundamentally incompatible with checksum-neutral\n   address
    translations.\n   Section 4.1 of [RFC6052] contains further discussion about IPv4/IPv6\n
    \  translation and checksum neutrality.\n   The Stateless IP/ICMP Translation
    algorithm [RFC7915] is one well-\n   known algorithm that can operate in a checksum-neutral
    manner, when\n   using the [RFC6052] algorithms for all of its address translations.\n
    \  However, in order to attain checksum neutrality, it is imperative\n   that
    the translation prefix be chosen carefully.  Specifically, in\n   order for a
    96-bit [RFC6052] prefix to be checksum neutral, all the\n   six 16-bit words in
    the prefix must add up to a multiple of 0xffff.\n   The following non-exhaustive
    list contains examples of translation\n   prefixes that are checksum neutral when
    used with the [RFC7915] and\n   [RFC6052] algorithms:\n   o  64:ff9b:1:fffe::/96\n
    \  o  64:ff9b:1:fffd:1::/96\n   o  64:ff9b:1:fffc:2::/96\n   o  64:ff9b:1:abcd:0:5431::/96\n"
