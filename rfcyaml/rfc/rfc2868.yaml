  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a set of RADIUS attributes designed to support\n\
    \   the provision of compulsory tunneling in dial-up networks.\n"
- title: 1.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.  Motivation\n   Many applications of tunneling protocols such as L2TP involve\
    \ dial-up\n   network access.  Some, such as the provision of access to corporate\n\
    \   intranets via the Internet, are characterized by voluntary tunneling:\n  \
    \ the tunnel is created at the request of the user for a specific\n   purpose.\
    \  Other applications involve compulsory tunneling: the tunnel\n   is created\
    \ without any action from the user and without allowing the\n   user any choice\
    \ in the matter.  In order to provide this\n   functionality, new RADIUS attributes\
    \ are needed to carry the\n   tunneling information from the RADIUS server to\
    \ the tunnel end\n   points; this document defines those attributes.  Specific\n\
    \   recommendations for, and examples of, the application of these\n   attributes\
    \ for L2TP can be found in RFC 2809.\n"
- title: 2.  Specification of Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Specification of Requirements\n   In this document, the key words \"MAY\"\
    , \"MUST, \"MUST NOT\", \"optional\",\n   \"recommended\", \"SHOULD\", and \"\
    SHOULD NOT\", are to be interpreted as\n   described in [14].\n"
- title: 3.  Attributes
  contents:
  - "3.  Attributes\n   Multiple instances of each of the attributes defined below\
    \ may be\n   included in a single RADIUS packet.  In this case, the attributes\
    \ to\n   be applied to any given tunnel SHOULD all contain the same value in\n\
    \   their respective Tag fields; otherwise, the Tag field SHOULD NOT be\n   used.\n\
    \   If the RADIUS server returns attributes describing multiple tunnels\n   then\
    \ the tunnels SHOULD be interpreted by the tunnel initiator as\n   alternatives\
    \ and the server SHOULD include an instance of the\n   Tunnel-Preference Attribute\
    \ in the set of Attributes pertaining to\n   each alternative tunnel.  Similarly,\
    \ if the RADIUS client includes\n   multiple sets of tunnel Attributes in an Access-Request\
    \ packet, all\n   the Attributes pertaining to a given tunnel SHOULD contain the\
    \ same\n   value in their respective Tag fields and each set SHOULD include an\n\
    \   appropriately valued instance of the Tunnel-Preference Attribute.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Tunnel-Type
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Tunnel-Type\n   Description\n      This Attribute indicates the tunneling\
    \ protocol(s) to be used (in\n      the case of a tunnel initiator) or the the\
    \ tunneling protocol in\n      use (in the case of a tunnel terminator).  It MAY\
    \ be included in\n      Access-Request, Access-Accept and Accounting-Request packets.\
    \  If\n      the Tunnel-Type Attribute is present in an Access-Request packet\n\
    \      sent from a tunnel initiator, it SHOULD be taken as a hint to the\n   \
    \   RADIUS server as to the tunnelling protocols supported by the\n      tunnel\
    \ end-point; the RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint, however.\n      A tunnel initiator\
    \ is not required to implement any of these\n      tunnel types; if a tunnel initiator\
    \ receives an Access-Accept\n      packet which contains only unknown or unsupported\
    \ Tunnel-Types,\n      the tunnel initiator MUST behave as though an Access-Reject\
    \ had\n      been received instead.\n      If the Tunnel-Type Attribute is present\
    \ in an Access-Request\n      packet sent from a tunnel terminator, it SHOULD\
    \ be taken to\n      signify the tunnelling protocol in use.  In this case, if\
    \ the\n      RADIUS server determines that the use of the communicated protocol\n\
    \      is not authorized, it MAY return an Access-Reject packet.  If a\n     \
    \ tunnel terminator receives an Access-Accept packet which contains\n      one\
    \ or more Tunnel-Type Attributes, none of which represent the\n      tunneling\
    \ protocol in use, the tunnel terminator SHOULD behave as\n      though an Access-Reject\

  - "3.7.  Tunnel-Assignment-ID\n   Description\n      This Attribute is used to indicate\
    \ to the tunnel initiator the\n      particular tunnel to which a session is to\
    \ be assigned.  Some\n      tunneling protocols, such as PPTP and L2TP, allow\
    \ for sessions\n      between the same two tunnel endpoints to be multiplexed\
    \ over the\n      same tunnel and also for a given session to utilize its own\n\
    \      dedicated tunnel.  This attribute provides a mechanism for RADIUS\n   \
    \   to be used to inform the tunnel initiator (e.g. PAC, LAC) whether\n      to\
    \ assign the session to a multiplexed tunnel or to a separate\n      tunnel. \
    \ Furthermore, it allows for sessions sharing multiplexed\n      tunnels to be\
    \ assigned to different multiplexed tunnels.\n      A particular tunneling implementation\
    \ may assign differing\n      characteristics to particular tunnels.  For example,\
    \ different\n      tunnels may be assigned different QOS parameters.  Such tunnels\n\
    \      may be used to carry either individual or multiple sessions.  The\n   \
    \   Tunnel-Assignment-ID attribute thus allows the RADIUS server to\n      indicate\
    \ that a particular session is to be assigned to a tunnel\n      that provides\
    \ an appropriate level of service.  It is expected\n      that any QOS-related\
    \ RADIUS tunneling attributes defined in the\n      future that accompany this\
    \ attribute will be associated by the\n      tunnel initiator with the ID given\
    \ by this attribute.  In the\n      meantime, any semantic given to a particular\
    \ ID string is a matter\n      left to local configuration in the tunnel initiator.\n\
    \      The Tunnel-Assignment-ID attribute is of significance only to\n      RADIUS\
    \ and the tunnel initiator.  The ID it specifies is intended\n      to be of only\
    \ local use to RADIUS and the tunnel initiator.  The\n      ID assigned by the\
    \ tunnel initiator is not conveyed to the tunnel\n      peer.\n      This attribute\
    \ MAY be included in the Access-Accept.  The tunnel\n      initiator receiving\
    \ this attribute MAY choose to ignore it and\n      assign the session to an arbitrary\
    \ multiplexed or non-multiplexed\n      tunnel between the desired endpoints.\
    \  This attribute SHOULD also\n      be included in Accounting-Request packets\
    \ which contain Acct-\n      Status-Type attributes with values of either Start\
    \ or Stop and\n      which pertain to a tunneled session.\n      If a tunnel initiator\
    \ supports the Tunnel-Assignment-ID Attribute,\n      then it should assign a\
    \ session to a tunnel in the following\n      manner:\n         If this attribute\
    \ is present and a tunnel exists between the\n         specified endpoints with\
    \ the specified ID, then the session\n         should be assigned to that tunnel.\n\
    \         If this attribute is present and no tunnel exists between the\n    \
    \     specified endpoints with the specified ID, then a new tunnel\n         should\
    \ be established for the session and the specified ID\n         should be associated\
    \ with the new tunnel.\n         If this attribute is not present, then the session\
    \ is assigned\n         to an unnamed tunnel.  If an unnamed tunnel does not yet\
    \ exist\n         between the specified endpoints then it is established and used\n\
    \         for this and subsequent sessions established without the\n         Tunnel-Assignment-ID\
    \ attribute.  A tunnel initiator MUST NOT\n         assign a session for which\
    \ a Tunnel-Assignment-ID Attribute was\n         not specified to a named tunnel\
    \ (i.e. one that was initiated by\n         a session specifying this attribute).\n\

    \ to hide\n   the value of the attribute is such that intervening RADIUS proxies\n\
    \   will have knowledge of the contents.  For this reason, the Tunnel-\n   Password\
    \ Attribute SHOULD NOT be included in Access-Accept packets\n   which may pass\
    \ through (relatively) untrusted RADIUS proxies.  In\n   addition, the Tunnel-Password\
    \ Attribute SHOULD NOT be returned to an\n   unauthenticated client; if the corresponding\

    \ Attribute [15],\n   the Access-Accept packet SHOULD NOT contain an instance\
    \ of the\n   Tunnel-Password Attribute.\n   Tunnel protocols offer various levels\
    \ of security, from none (e.g.,\n   PPTP) to strong (e.g., IPSec).  Note, however,\
    \ that in the compulsory\n   tunneling case any security measures in place only\
    \ apply to traffic\n   between the tunnel endpoints.  In particular, end-users\
    \ SHOULD NOT\n   rely upon the security of the tunnel to protect their data;\n\
