  - "Abstract\n   There are many scenarios in which users must be able to prove the\n\
    \   existence of data at a specific point in time and be able to\n   demonstrate\
    \ the integrity of data since that time, even when the\n   duration from time\
    \ of existence to time of demonstration spans a\n   large period of time.  Additionally,\
    \ users must be able to verify\n   signatures on digitally signed data many years\
    \ after the generation\n   of the signature.  This document describes a class\
    \ of long-term\n   archive services to support such scenarios and the technical\n\
    \   requirements for interacting with such services.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Digital data durability is undermined by continual progress\
    \ and\n   change on a number of fronts.  The useful lifetime of data may exceed\n\
    \   the life span of formats and mechanisms used to store the data.  The\n   lifetime\
    \ of digitally signed data may exceed the validity periods of\n   public-key certificates\
    \ used to verify signatures or the\n   cryptanalysis period of the cryptographic\
    \ algorithms used to generate\n   the signatures, i.e., the time after which an\
    \ algorithm no longer\n   provides the intended security properties.  Technical\
    \ and operational\n   means are required to mitigate these issues.  A solution\
    \ must address\n   issues such as storage media lifetime, disaster planning, advances\
    \ in\n   cryptanalysis or computational capabilities, changes in software\n  \
    \ technology, and legal issues.\n   A long-term archive service aids in the preservation\
    \ of data over\n   long periods of time through a regimen of technical and procedural\n\
    \   mechanisms designed to support claims regarding a data object.  For\n   example,\
    \ it might periodically perform activities to preserve data\n   integrity and\
    \ the non-repudiability of data existence by a particular\n   point in time or\
    \ take actions to ensure the availability of data.\n   Examples of periodic activities\
    \ include refreshing time stamps or\n   transferring data to a new storage medium.\n\
    \   A long-term archive service may be used to provide evidence that\n   supports\
    \ validation of the existence of documents or assertions of\n   agreements that\
    \ were originally asserted with digital signatures.\n   Validation may occur at\
    \ times in the future well beyond the validity\n   period of the private key originally\
    \ used to generate the signature,\n   or even beyond the time when the algorithms\
    \ available for digital\n   signatures, message digesting, or data encryption\
    \ cease to offer\n   effective protection because of improvements in computing\
    \ speeds and\n   methods.\n   A long-term archive service may be located within\
    \ an enterprise\n   network, communicating with local storage mechanisms and other\n\
    \   applications, or a long-term archive service may be implemented as an\n  \
    \ external service accessible via the Internet.  A long-term archive\n   service\
    \ may use functionality, e.g., time stamping, provided by\n   independent service\
    \ providers.\n   A primary goal of a long-term archive service is to support the\n\
    \   credible assertion of a claim that is currently asserted, at points\n   well\
    \ into the future.  A long-term archive service may support a\n   range of applications,\
    \ including: wills, land records, medical data,\n   criminal case files, personnel\
    \ files, and contracts.  A long-term\n   archive service may be used by any type\
    \ of entity, e.g.,\n   organizations, citizens, notaries.  Examples of long-term\
    \ archive\n   service usage by submitters include:\n   -  A company stores contracts\
    \ using a third party service.\n   -  A hospital stores medical data using an\
    \ internal service.\n   -  An individual wants to generate evidence of data possession\
    \ at a\n      particular point in time, e.g., for intellectual property purposes\n\
    \      or endorsement of a contract.\n   -  A law enforcement officer wants to\
    \ store criminal data such that\n      integrity of the data can be demonstrated\
    \ years later.\n   For each of the above examples, there is a corresponding example\n\
    \   involving retrievers, e.g., a company retrieves a contract in the\n   case\
    \ of a dispute or a law enforcement officer prepares information\n   for a criminal\
    \ trial.\n   This document addresses the technical requirements for a long-term\n\
    \   archive service.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   We define the following terms based on their usage in the\
    \ archiving\n   community, in order to provide a vocabulary for describing\n \
    \  requirements and the standards around them.\n   Arbitrator:   Principal for\
    \ whom the validity of archived data\n      characteristics, e.g., origin, integrity\
    \ or time of existence,\n      must be demonstrated.\n   Archival Period:   The\
    \ period during which an archived data object is\n      preserved by a long-term\
    \ archive service.\n   Archived Data Object:   Data unit to be preserved by a\
    \ long-term\n      archive service.\n   Archive Package:   Collection of information\
    \ including archived data\n      objects and associated Evidence Record.\n   Cryptographic\
    \ Maintenance Policy:   A set of rules that defines how\n      to maintain the\
    \ validity of digitally signed objects should one of\n      the hash or asymmetric\
    \ algorithms used to create a digital\n      signature become weak, or one of\
    \ the private keys used to create a\n      digital signature be compromised or\
    \ become weak.\n   Evidence:   Information that may be used to demonstrate the\
    \ validity\n      of an archived data object or related attestations.\n   Evidence\
    \ Record:   Collection of evidence compiled for one or more\n      archived data\
    \ objects.  An Evidence Record may include\n      acknowledgements from a long-term\
    \ archive service, time stamps and\n      verification data, such as public-key\
    \ certificates, revocation\n      information, trust anchors, policy details and\
    \ role information.\n   Long-Term Archive Policy:   A set of rules that define\
    \ operational\n      characteristics of a long-term archive service.\n   Long-Term\
    \ Archive Service (LTA):   A service that is responsible for\n      preserving\
    \ data for long periods.\n   Modifier:   Principal who modifies attributes associated\
    \ with an\n      archived data object and/or Evidence Record held by a long-term\n\
    \      archive service.\n   Originator:   Principal who produces, and possibly\
    \ digitally signs,\n      an archived data object.  The Originator does not necessarily\
    \ have\n      any relationship with a long-term archive service or any awareness\n\
    \      of an Evidence Record associated with the archived data object.\n   Retriever:\
    \   Principal who retrieves archived data objects and/or\n      Evidence Records\
    \ from a long-term archive service.\n   Submitter:   Principal who submits data\
    \ objects for archiving.\n   Time Stamp:   An attestation generated by a Time\
    \ Stamping Authority\n      (TSA) that a data item existed at a certain time.\
    \  For example,\n      [RFC3161] specifies a structure for signed time stamp tokens\
    \ as\n      part of a protocol for communicating with a TSA.\n   Time Stamping\
    \ Authority (TSA):   A trusted service that provides\n      attestations of existence\
    \ of data at particular points in time.\n      For example, [RFC3161] defines\
    \ protocol elements for interacting\n      with a TSA.\n"
- title: 3.  General Principles
  contents:
  - "3.  General Principles\n   A long-term archive service may accept any type of\
    \ data for\n   preservation.  The data might be in any format, whether textual\
    \ data,\n   images, documents, applications, or compound packages of multiple\n\
    \   components.  The data may be digitally signed, time stamped,\n   encrypted,\
    \ or not subject to any cryptographic processing.\n   A long-term archive service\
    \ may preserve archived data objects as\n   opaque collections of bytes with the\
    \ primary aim of data integrity.\n   A long-term archive service is not required\
    \ to operate upon evidence\n   related to the content of archived data objects.\
    \  Content-focused\n   operations, including data format migration or translation,\
    \ may be\n   performed by another service.  However, an LTA may incorporate\n\
    \   support for such services.\n   Different long-term archive services may establish\
    \ policies and\n   procedures for archiving data objects over different lengths\
    \ of time.\n   For example, an LTA may refuse to preserve archived data objects\
    \ for\n   periods longer than 30 years.  Similarly, LTAs may establish policies\n\
    \   that limit the types of data that will be accepted for deposit by a\n   particular\
    \ LTA.\n   A long-term archive service provides evidence that may be used to\n\
    \   demonstrate the existence of an archived data object at a given time\n   and\
    \ the integrity of the archived data object since that time.\n   Additionally,\
    \ the evidence identifies the LTA(s) that have\n   participated in the preservation\
    \ of the archived data object.  If the\n   archived data object itself contains\
    \ digitally signed data,\n   authentication of the signer is also possible.\n\
    \   A long-term archive service may be an adjunct component of a document\n  \
    \ management system.  In such cases, the Evidence Record generated and\n   maintained\
    \ by the LTA is a property of data that is otherwise managed\n   by the document\
    \ management system.\n"

  - "4.1.1.  Functional Requirements\n   A long-term archive service must permit clients\
    \ to request the\n   following basic operations:\n   -  submit data objects for\
    \ archive\n   -  retrieve archived data objects\n   -  delete archived data objects\n\
    \   Following submission, the service must provide an identifier that can\n  \
    \ be used to retrieve the archived data and/or associated evidence.\n   For example,\
    \ it may be possible to retrieve archive packages by using\n   a hash value of\
    \ an archived data object.  Possession of this value is\n   not necessarily an\
    \ authorization to access the associated archived\n   data object or evidence\
    \ record.\n   It must be possible to authenticate requests and responses, e.g.,\
    \ to\n   enable LTAs to render an authorization decision.  This may be\n   accomplished\
    \ by using transport security mechanisms.  Requests, in\n   particular retrieval\
    \ or deletion requests, may be rejected if the\n   requestor is not authorized.\
    \  An authorization policy must be defined\n   and observed by the long-term archive\
    \ service.  An LTA may disallow\n   deletion as a matter of policy.\n   The format\
    \ for the acknowledgements must allow the identification of\n   the archiving\
    \ provider and the participating client.\n   The LTA must provide an acknowledgement\
    \ of the deposit that permits\n   the submitter to confirm the correct data was\
    \ accepted by the LTA.\n   This proof need not be provided immediately.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Rationale\n   Submission, retrieval, query state, and deletion of archived\
    \ data\n   objects are necessary basic functions of a long-term archive service.\n\
    \   Deletion may be disallowed due to procedural difficulties in\n   fulfilling\
    \ the request.  For example, an archived data object may be\n   stored on write-once\
    \ media, along with other records that are not\n   subject to deletion.\n   Acknowledgements\
    \ may not be provided immediately due to\n   implementation of a grace period.\
    \  A generic query state mechanism\n   should be provided to address such situations.\
    \  For example, a\n   submission response may indicate that a submission has been\
    \ accepted\n   and a subsequent query state response may indicate a submission\
    \ has\n   completed all necessary preservation steps.\n"

  - "4.2.1.  Functional Requirements\n   A long-term archive service must operate\
    \ in accordance with a long-\n   term archive service policy that defines characteristics\
    \ of the\n   implementation of the long-term archive service.  A long-term archive\n\
    \   service policy contains several components, including:\n   -  Archived data\
    \ object maintenance policy\n   -  Authorization policy\n   -  Service policy\n\
    \   A long-term archive service policy must include specifications of the\n  \
    \ preservation activities performed for archived data objects subject\n   to the\
    \ policy.  A maintenance policy should define rules for the\n   following operational\
    \ aspects: preservation activity triggers,\n   default archival period, and default\
    \ handling upon expiration of\n   archival period.\n   Maintenance policies should\
    \ include mechanism-specific details\n   describing LTA operation.  For example,\
    \ where cryptographic\n   mechanisms are employed, a cryptographic maintenance\
    \ policy ought to\n   be defined.\n   An authorization policy should define the\
    \ entities permitted to\n   exercise services provided by the LTA, including who\
    \ is permitted to\n   submit, retrieve, or manage specific archived data objects.\n\
    \   A service policy defines the types of services provided by an LTA,\n   including\
    \ acceptable data types, description of requests that may be\n   accepted, and\
    \ deletion procedures.\n   Policies must be unambiguously identified, e.g., by\
    \ an object\n   identifier.  Alternatively, an LTA may support a protocol that\n\
    \   permits clients to specify policy parameters explicitly instead of by\n  \
    \ reference to a policy.\n   A long-term archive service must be able to provide\

    \  The evidence record should contain\n   sufficient information to enable the\

    \ and origin\n   is a primary purpose of a long-term archive service.  Evidence\
    \ may be\n   generated, or otherwise obtained, by the service providing the\n\
    \   evidence to a retriever.  A long-term archive service need not be\n   capable\
    \ of providing all evidence necessary to produce a non-\n   repudiation proof,\
    \ and in some cases, should not be trusted to\n   provide all necessary information.\
    \  For example, trust anchors\n   [RFC3280] and algorithm security policies should\
    \ be provided by other\n   services.  An LTA that is trusted to provide trust\
    \ anchors could\n   forge an evidence record verified by using those trust anchors.\n\
    \   Demonstration that data has not been altered while in the care of a\n   long-term\
    \ archive service is a first step towards supporting non-\n   repudiation of data.\

    \ In such cases, it must be possible\n   for the submitter to transfer an archived\
    \ data object and all\n   associated evidence from the original LTA to a new LTA.\n"

  - "4.7.1.  Functional Requirements\n   An LTA should support submission of groups\
    \ of data objects.\n   Submitters should be able to indicate which data objects\
    \ belong\n   together, i.e. comprise a group, and retrievers should be able to\n\
    \   retrieve one, some or all members of a group of data objects.\n   It should\
    \ be possible to provide evidence for groups of archived data\n   objects.  For\
    \ example, it should be possible to archive a document\n   file and a signature\
    \ file together such that they are covered by the\n   same evidence record.\n\
    \   Where an LTA operates upon groups of data objects, non-repudiation\n   proof\
    \ must still be available for each archived data object\n   separately.\n"

  - "4.7.2.  Rationale\n   In many cases data objects belong together.  Examples include:\n\
    \   -  a document file and an associated signature file, which are two\n     \
    \ separate objects\n   -  TIF-files representing pages of a document\n   -  a\
    \ document file and an evidence file (possibly generated by\n      another LTA)\n\
    \   -  a document and its translation to another format or language\n   In these\
    \ cases, it is to the best advantage to handle these data\n   objects as a group.\n"
- title: 5.  Operational Considerations

  - "5.  Operational Considerations\n   A long-term archive service must be able to\
    \ work efficiently even for\n   large amounts of archived data objects.  In order\
    \ to limit expenses\n   and to achieve high performance, it may be desirable to\
    \ minimize the\n   use of trusted third parties, e.g., LTA operations should be\
    \ designed\n   to limit the number of time stamps required to provide the desired\n\
    \   level of service.\n   Necessity to access archived data objects should be\
    \ minimized.  It\n   may only be necessary to access the archived data objects\
    \ if the\n   archived data objects are requested by users, or if hash algorithms\n\
    \   used for indexing, or evidence record generation become insecure.\n   An LTA\
    \ must be capable of operating in accordance with any applicable\n   legal regime.\
    \  For example, an LTA may be required to reject a\n   deletion request from an\
    \ authorized requestor if the target of the\n   request has been subpoenaed by\
    \ law enforcement authorities.\n   Some applications may require processing of\
    \ a chain of archive\n   policies present in an evidence record, e.g., to ensure\
    \ that\n   compatible policies were used throughout the lifetime of the archived\n\
    \   data objects.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Data is the principal asset protected by a long-term\
    \ archive service.\n   The principle threat that must be addressed by a long-term\
    \ archive\n   service is an undetected loss of data integrity.\n   In cases where\
    \ signature verification relies on a PKI, certificate\n   revocation could retroactively\
    \ invalidate previously verified\n   signatures.  An LTA may implement measures\
    \ to support such claims by\n   an alleged signer, e.g., collection of revocation\
    \ information after a\n   grace period during which compromise can be reported\
    \ or preservation\n   of subsequent revocation information.\n   When selecting\
    \ access control mechanisms associated with data stored\n   by a LTA, the lifespan\
    \ of the archived data object should be\n   considered.  For example, the credentials\
    \ of an entity that submitted\n   data to an archive may not be available or valid\
    \ when the data needs\n   to be retrieved.\n   During the lifespan of an archived\
    \ data object, formats may cease to\n   be supported.  Software components to\
    \ process data, including content\n   or signatures, may no longer be available.\
    \  This could be a problem\n   particularly if non-standard formats are used or\
    \ proprietary\n   processing is employed.  The submitter should take care to avoid\
    \ such\n   problems.  For example, the submitter (or other authorized entity)\n\
    \   could periodically retrieve data, convert the data, and re-submit it\n   in\
    \ a new format.  Additional mechanisms, applications, or tools may\n   be needed\
    \ to preserve the value of evidence records associated with\n   the original archived\
    \ data object.\n   A long-term archive system may require correlation of different\n\
    \   identities that represent the same entity at different points in\n   time.\
    \  For example, an individual's identity may be represented by\n   different employers\
    \ at different points in time.\n   A long-term archive system must perform maintenance\
    \ activities on a\n   schedule that considers factors such as the strength of\
    \ relevant\n   cryptographic algorithms, lifespan of relevant certification\n\
    \   authorities, and revocation status of relevant entities, e.g.,\n   timestamp\
    \ authorities.  Standards for use of cryptographic algorithms\n   are expected\
    \ to be established by organization or governmental\n   bodies, not by individual\
    \ LTAs.\n"
