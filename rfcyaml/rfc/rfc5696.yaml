  - "Abstract\n   The objective of the Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) architecture\n\
    \   is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within\n   a\
    \ Diffserv domain.  It achieves this by marking packets belonging to\n   PCN-flows\
    \ when the rate of traffic exceeds certain configured\n   thresholds on links\
    \ in the domain.  These marks can then be evaluated\n   to determine how close\
    \ the domain is to being congested.  This\n   document specifies how such marks\
    \ are encoded into the IP header by\n   redefining the Explicit Congestion Notification\
    \ (ECN) codepoints\n   within such domains.  The baseline encoding described here\
    \ provides\n   only two PCN encoding states: Not-marked and PCN-marked.  Future\n\
    \   extensions to this encoding may be needed in order to provide more\n   than\
    \ one level of marking severity.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The objective of the Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) architecture\n\
    \   [RFC5559] is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic\n   flows\
    \ within a Diffserv domain in a simple, scalable, and robust\n   fashion.  The\
    \ overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in\n   the PCN-domain,\
    \ and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain\n   configured rates are\
    \ exceeded.  These configured rates are below the\n   rate of the link, thus providing\
    \ notification before any congestion\n   occurs (hence \"Pre-Congestion Notification\"\
    ).  The level of marking\n   allows the boundary nodes to make decisions about\
    \ whether to admit or\n   block a new flow request, and (in abnormal circumstances)\
    \ whether to\n   terminate some of the existing flows, thereby protecting the\
    \ QoS of\n   previously admitted flows.\n   This document specifies how these\
    \ PCN-marks are encoded into the IP\n   header by reusing the bits of the Explicit\
    \ Congestion Notification\n   (ECN) field [RFC3168].  It also describes how packets\
    \ are identified\n   as belonging to a PCN-flow.  Some deployment models require\
    \ two PCN\n   encoding states, others require more.  The baseline encoding\n \
    \  described here only provides for two PCN encoding states.  However,\n   the\
    \ encoding can be easily extended to provide more states.  Rules\n   for such\
    \ extensions are given in Section 5.\n"

- title: 4.  Encoding Two PCN States in IP
  contents:
  - "4.  Encoding Two PCN States in IP\n   The PCN encoding states are defined using\
    \ a combination of the DSCP\n   and ECN fields within the IP header.  The baseline\
    \ PCN encoding\n   closely follows the semantics of ECN [RFC3168].  It allows\
    \ the\n   encoding of two PCN states: Not-marked and PCN-marked.  It also\n  \
    \ allows for traffic that is not PCN-capable to be marked as such (not-\n   PCN).\
    \  Given the scarcity of codepoints within the IP header, the\n   baseline encoding\
    \ leaves one codepoint free for experimental use.\n   The following table defines\
    \ how to encode these states in IP:\n   +---------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+---------+\n\
    \   | ECN codepoint |   Not-ECT   | ECT(0) (10) | ECT(1) (01) | CE (11) |\n  \
    \ |               |     (00)    |             |             |         |\n   +---------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+---------+\n\

    \ +---------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+---------+\n    \
    \                    Table 1: Encoding PCN in IP\n   In the table above, DSCP\
    \ n is a PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint\n   (see Section 4.4) and EXP means\
    \ available for Experimental use.  N.B.\n   we deliberately reserve this codepoint\
    \ for experimental use only (and\n   not local use) to prevent future compatibility\
    \ issues.\n   The following rules apply to all PCN-traffic:\n   o  PCN-traffic\
    \ MUST be marked with a PCN-compatible Diffserv\n      codepoint.  To conserve\
    \ DSCPs, Diffserv codepoints SHOULD be\n      chosen that are already defined\
    \ for use with admission-controlled\n      traffic.  Appendix A.1 gives guidance\
    \ to implementors on suitable\n      DSCPs.  Guidelines for mixing traffic types\
    \ within a PCN-domain\n      are given in [RFC5670].\n   o  Any packet arriving\
    \ at the PCN-ingress-node that shares a PCN-\n      compatible DSCP and is not\
    \ a PCN-packet MUST be marked as not-PCN\n      within the PCN-domain.\n   o \
    \ If a packet arrives at the PCN-ingress-node with its ECN field\n      already\
    \ set to a value other than not-ECT, then appropriate action\n      MUST be taken\
    \ to meet the requirements of [RFC3168].  The simplest\n      appropriate action\
    \ is to just drop such packets.  However, this is\n      a drastic action that\
    \ an operator may feel is undesirable.\n      Appendix B provides more information\
    \ and summarises other\n      alternative actions that might be taken.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Marking Packets\n   [RFC5670] states that any encoding scheme document\
    \ must specify the\n   required action to take if one of the marking algorithms\
    \ indicates\n   that a packet needs to be marked.  For the baseline encoding scheme,\n\
    \   the required action is simply as follows:\n   o  If a marking algorithm indicates\
    \ the need to mark a PCN-packet,\n      then that packet MUST have its PCN codepoint\
    \ set to 11, PCN-\n      marked.\n"

    \  It MUST set the not-PCN\n   (00) codepoint on all other packets sharing a PCN-compatible\
    \ Diffserv\n   codepoint.\n   The only valid codepoint transitions within a PCN-interior-node\
    \ are\n   from NM to PM (which should occur if either meter indicates a need to\n\

- title: 4.3.  Rationale for Encoding
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Rationale for Encoding\n   The exact choice of encoding was dictated by\
    \ the constraints imposed\n   by existing IETF RFCs, in particular [RFC3168],\
    \ [RFC4301], and\n   [RFC4774].  One of the tightest constraints was the need\
    \ for any PCN\n   encoding to survive being tunnelled through either an IP-in-IP\
    \ tunnel\n   or an IPsec Tunnel.  [ECN-TUN] explains this in more detail.  The\n\
    \   main effect of this constraint is that any PCN-marking has to carry\n   the\
    \ 11 codepoint in the ECN field since this is the only codepoint\n   that is guaranteed\
    \ to be copied down into the forwarded header upon\n   decapsulation.  An additional\
    \ constraint is the need to minimise the\n   use of Diffserv codepoints because\
    \ there is a limited supply of\n   Standards Track codepoints remaining.  Section\
    \ 4.4 explains how we\n   have minimised this still further by reusing pre-existing\
    \ Diffserv\n   codepoint(s) such that non-PCN-traffic can still be distinguished\n\
    \   from PCN-traffic.\n   There are a number of factors that were considered before\
    \ choosing to\n   set 10 as the NM state instead of 01.  These included similarity\
    \ to\n   ECN, presence of tunnels within the domain, leakage into and out of\n\
    \   the PCN-domain, and incremental deployment (see Appendix A.2).\n   The encoding\
    \ scheme above seems to meet all these constraints and\n   ends up looking very\
    \ similar to ECN.  This is perhaps not surprising\n   given the similarity in\
    \ architectural intent between PCN and ECN.\n"
- title: 4.4.  PCN-Compatible Diffserv Codepoints
  contents:
  - "4.4.  PCN-Compatible Diffserv Codepoints\n   Equipment complying with the baseline\
    \ PCN encoding MUST allow PCN to\n   be enabled for certain Diffserv codepoints.\
    \  This document defines\n   the term \"PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint\" for\
    \ such a DSCP.  To be\n   clear, any packets with such a DSCP will be PCN-enabled\
    \ only if they\n   are within a PCN-domain and have their ECN field set to indicate\
    \ a\n   codepoint other than not-PCN.\n   Enabling PCN-marking behaviour for a\
    \ specific DSCP disables any other\n   marking behaviour (e.g., enabling PCN replaces\
    \ the default ECN\n   marking behaviour introduced in [RFC3168]) with the PCN-metering\
    \ and\n   -marking behaviours described in [RFC5670]).  This ensures compliance\n\
    \   with the Best Current Practice (BCP) guidance set out in [RFC4774].\n   The\
    \ PCN working group has chosen not to define a single DSCP for use\n   with PCN\
    \ for several reasons.  Firstly, the PCN mechanism is\n   applicable to a variety\
    \ of different traffic classes.  Secondly,\n   Standards Track DSCPs are in increasingly\
    \ short supply.  Thirdly, PCN\n   is not a scheduling behaviour -- rather, it\
    \ should be seen as being\n   essentially a marking behaviour similar to ECN but\
    \ intended for\n   inelastic traffic.  More details are given in the informational\n\
    \   Appendix A.1.\n"
- title: 4.4.1.  Co-Existence of PCN and Not-PCN Traffic
  contents:
  - "4.4.1.  Co-Existence of PCN and Not-PCN Traffic\n   The scarcity of pool 1 DSCPs,\
    \ coupled with the fact that PCN is\n   envisaged as a marking behaviour that\
    \ could be applied to a number of\n   different DSCPs, makes it essential that\
    \ we provide a not-PCN state.\n   As stated above (and expanded in Appendix A.1),\
    \ the aim is for PCN to\n   re-use existing DSCPs.  Because PCN redefines the\
    \ meaning of the ECN\n   field for such DSCPs, it is important to allow an operator\
    \ to still\n   use the DSCP for non-PCN-traffic.  This is achieved by providing\
    \ a\n   not-PCN state within the encoding scheme.  Section 3.5 of [RFC5559]\n\
    \   discusses how competing-non-PCN-traffic should be handled.\n"
- title: 5.  Rules for Experimental Encoding Schemes
  contents:
  - "5.  Rules for Experimental Encoding Schemes\n   Any experimental encoding scheme\
    \ MUST follow these rules to ensure\n   backward compatibility with this baseline\
    \ scheme:\n   o  All PCN-interior-nodes within a PCN-domain MUST interpret the\
    \ 00\n      codepoint in the ECN field as not-PCN and MUST NOT change it to\n\
    \      another value.  Therefore, a PCN-ingress-node wishing to disable\n    \
    \  PCN-marking for a packet with a PCN-compatible Diffserv codepoint\n      MUST\
    \ set the ECN field to 00.\n   o  The 11 codepoint in the ECN field MUST indicate\
    \ that the packet\n      has been PCN-marked as the result of one or both of the\
    \ meters\n      indicating a need to PCN-mark a packet [RFC5670].  The\n     \
    \ experimental scheme MUST define which meter(s) trigger this\n      marking.\n\
    \   o  The 01 Experimental codepoint in the ECN field MAY mean PCN-marked\n  \
    \    or it MAY carry some other meaning.  However, any experimental\n      scheme\
    \ MUST define its meaning in the context of that experiment.\n   o  If both the\
    \ 01 and 11 codepoints are being used to indicate PCN-\n      marked, then the\
    \ 11 codepoint MUST be taken to be the more severe\n      marking and the choice\
    \ of which meter sets which mark MUST be\n      defined.\n   o  Once set, the\
    \ 11 codepoint in the ECN field MUST NOT be changed to\n      any other codepoint.\n\
    \   o  Any experimental scheme MUST include details of all valid and\n      invalid\
    \ codepoint transitions at any PCN-nodes.\n"
- title: 6.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "6.  Backward Compatibility\n   BCP 124 [RFC4774] gives guidelines for specifying\
    \ alternative\n   semantics for the ECN field.  It sets out a number of factors\
    \ to be\n   taken into consideration.  It also suggests various techniques to\n\
    \   allow the co-existence of default ECN and alternative ECN semantics.\n   The\
    \ baseline encoding specified in this document defines PCN-\n   compatible Diffserv\
    \ codepoints as no longer supporting the default\n   ECN semantics.  As such,\
    \ this document is compatible with BCP 124.\n   On its own, this baseline encoding\
    \ cannot support both ECN marking\n   end-to-end (e2e) and PCN-marking within\
    \ a PCN-domain.  It is possible\n   to do this by carrying e2e ECN across a PCN-domain\
    \ within the inner\n   header of an IP-in-IP tunnel, or by using a richer encoding\
    \ such as\n   the proposed experimental scheme in [PCN-ENC].\n   In any PCN deployment,\
    \ traffic can only enter the PCN-domain through\n   PCN-ingress-nodes and leave\
    \ through PCN-egress-nodes.  PCN-ingress-\n   nodes ensure that any packets entering\
    \ the PCN-domain have the ECN\n   field in their outermost IP header set to the\
    \ appropriate PCN\n   codepoint.  PCN-egress-nodes then guarantee that the ECN\
    \ field of any\n   packet leaving the PCN-domain has the correct ECN semantics.\
    \  This\n   prevents unintended leakage of ECN marks into or out of the PCN-\n\
    \   domain, and thus reduces backward-compatibility issues.\n"

    \ are\n   authorised to be PCN-marked, which will be described in separate\n \
    \  documents on PCN-boundary-node behaviour.\n   This document assumes the PCN-domain\
    \ to be entirely under the control\n   of a single operator, or a set of operators\
    \ who trust each other.\n   However, future extensions to PCN might include inter-domain\
    \ versions\n   where trust cannot be assumed between domains.  If such schemes\
    \ are\n   proposed, they must ensure that they can operate securely despite the\n\
    \   lack of trust.  However, such considerations are beyond the scope of\n   this\
    \ document.\n   One potential security concern is the injection of spurious PCN-marks\n\
    \   into the PCN-domain.  However, these can only enter the domain if a\n   PCN-ingress-node\
    \ is misconfigured.  The precise impact of any such\n   misconfiguration will\
    \ depend on which of the proposed PCN-boundary-\n   node behaviour schemes is\
    \ used, but in general spurious marks will\n   lead to admitting fewer flows into\
    \ the domain or potentially\n   terminating too many flows.  In either case, good\
    \ management should\n   be able to quickly spot the problem since the overall\
    \ utilisation of\n   the domain will rapidly fall.\n"

  - "8.  Conclusions\n   This document defines the baseline PCN encoding, utilising\
    \ a\n   combination of a PCN-compatible DSCP and the ECN field in the IP\n   header.\
    \  This baseline encoding allows the existence of two PCN\n   encoding states:\
    \ Not-marked and PCN-marked.  It also allows for the\n   co-existence of competing\
    \ traffic within the same DSCP, so long as\n   that traffic does not require ECN\
    \ support within the PCN-domain.  The\n   encoding scheme is conformant with [RFC4774].\
    \  The working group has\n   chosen not to define a single DSCP for use with PCN.\
    \  The rationale\n   for this decision along with advice relating to the choice\
    \ of\n   suitable DSCPs can be found in Appendix A.1.\n"

- title: A.1.  Choice of Suitable DSCPs
  contents:
  - "A.1.  Choice of Suitable DSCPs\n   The PCN working group chose not to define\
    \ a single DSCP for use with\n   PCN for several reasons.  Firstly, the PCN mechanism\
    \ is applicable to\n   a variety of different traffic classes.  Secondly, Standards\
    \ Track\n   DSCPs are in increasingly short supply.  Thirdly, PCN is not a\n \
    \  scheduling behaviour -- rather, it should be seen as being a marking\n   behaviour\
    \ similar to ECN but intended for inelastic traffic.  The\n   choice of which\
    \ DSCP is most suitable for a given PCN-domain is\n   dependent on the nature\
    \ of the traffic entering that domain and the\n   link rates of all the links\
    \ making up that domain.  In PCN-domains\n   with sufficient aggregation, the\
    \ appropriate DSCPs would currently be\n   those for the Real-Time Treatment Aggregate\
    \ [RFC5127].  The PCN\n   working group suggests using admission control for the\
    \ following\n   service classes (defined in [RFC4594]):\n   o  Telephony (EF)\n\
    \   o  Real-time interactive (CS4)\n   o  Broadcast Video (CS3)\n   o  Multimedia\
    \ Conferencing (AF4)\n   CS5 is excluded from this list since PCN is not expected\
    \ to be\n   applied to signalling traffic.\n   PCN-marking is intended to provide\
    \ a scalable admission-control\n   mechanism for traffic with a high degree of\
    \ statistical multiplexing.\n   PCN-marking would therefore be appropriate to\
    \ apply to traffic in the\n   above classes, but only within a PCN-domain containing\
    \ sufficiently\n   aggregated traffic.  In such cases, the above service classes\
    \ may\n   well all be subject to a single forwarding treatment (treatment\n  \
    \ aggregate [RFC5127]).  However, this does not imply all such IP\n   traffic\
    \ would necessarily be identified by one DSCP -- each service\n   class might\
    \ keep a distinct DSCP within the highly aggregated region\n   [RFC5127].\n  \
    \ Additional service classes may be defined for which admission control\n   is\
    \ appropriate, whether through some future standards action or\n   through local\
    \ use by certain operators, e.g., the Multimedia\n   Streaming service class (AF3).\
    \  This document does not preclude the\n   use of PCN in more cases than those\
    \ listed above.\n   Note: The above discussion is informative not normative, as\
    \ operators\n   are ultimately free to decide whether to use admission control\
    \ for\n   certain service classes and whether to use PCN as their mechanism of\n\
    \   choice.\n"
- title: A.2.  Rationale for Using ECT(0) for Not-Marked
  contents:
  - "A.2.  Rationale for Using ECT(0) for Not-Marked\n   The choice of which ECT codepoint\
    \ to use for the Not-marked state was\n   based on the following considerations:\n\
    \   o  [RFC3168] full-functionality tunnel within the PCN-domain: Either\n   \
    \   ECT is safe.\n   o  Leakage of traffic into PCN-domain: Because of the lack\
    \ of take-up\n      of the ECN nonce [RFC3540], leakage of ECT(1) is less likely\
    \ to\n      occur and so might be considered safer.\n   o  Leakage of traffic\
    \ out of PCN-domain: Either ECT is equally unsafe\n      (since this would incorrectly\
    \ indicate the traffic was ECN-capable\n      outside the controlled PCN-domain).\n\
    \   o  Incremental deployment: Either codepoint is suitable, providing\n     \
    \ that the codepoints are used consistently.\n   o  Conceptual consistency with\
    \ other schemes: ECT(0) is conceptually\n      consistent with [RFC3168].\n  \
    \ Overall, this seemed to suggest that ECT(0) was most appropriate to\n   use.\n"
- title: Appendix B.  Co-Existence of PCN and ECN (Informative)
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Co-Existence of PCN and ECN (Informative)\n   This baseline encoding\
    \ scheme redefines the ECN codepoints within the\n   PCN-domain.  As packets with\
    \ a PCN-compatible DSCP leave the PCN-\n   domain, their ECN field is reset to\
    \ not-ECT (00).  This is a problem\n   for the operator if packets with a PCN-compatible\
    \ DSCP arrive at the\n   PCN-domain with any ECN codepoint other than not-ECN.\
    \  If the ECN-\n   codepoint is ECT(0) (10) or ECT(1) (01), resetting the ECN\
    \ field to\n   00 effectively turns off end-to-end ECN.  This is undesirable as\
    \ it\n   removes the benefits of ECN, but [RFC3168] states that it is no worse\n\
    \   than dropping the packet.  However, if a packet was marked with CE\n   (11),\
    \ resetting the ECN field to 00 at the PCN egress node violates\n   the rule that\
    \ CE-marks must never be lost except as a result of\n   packet drop [RFC3168].\n\
    \   A number of options exist to overcome this issue.  The most\n   appropriate\
    \ option will depend on the circumstances and has to be a\n   decision for the\
    \ operator.  The definition of the action is beyond\n   the scope of this document,\
    \ but we briefly explain the four broad\n   categories of solution below: tunnelling\
    \ the packets, using an\n   extended encoding scheme, signalling to the end systems\
    \ to stop using\n   ECN, or re-marking packets to a different DSCP.\n   o  Tunnelling\
    \ the packets across the PCN-domain (for instance, in an\n      IP-in-IP tunnel\
    \ from the PCN-ingress-node to the PCN-egress-node)\n      preserves the original\
    \ ECN marking on the inner header.\n   o  An extended encoding scheme can be designed\
    \ that preserves the\n      original ECN codepoints.  For instance, if the PCN-egress-node\
    \ can\n      determine from the PCN codepoint what the original ECN codepoint\n\
    \      was, then it can reset the packet to that codepoint.  [PCN-ENC]\n     \
    \ partially achieves this but is unable to recover ECN markings if\n      the\
    \ packet is PCN-marked in the PCN-domain.\n   o  Explicit signalling to the end\
    \ systems can indicate to the source\n      that ECN cannot be used on this path\
    \ (because it does not support\n      ECN and PCN at the same time).  Dropping\
    \ the packet can be thought\n      of as a form of silent signal to the source,\
    \ as it will see any\n      ECT-marked packets it sends being dropped.\n   o \
    \ Packets that are not part of a PCN-flow but which share a PCN-\n      compatible\
    \ DSCP can be re-marked to a different local-use DSCP at\n      the PCN-ingress-node\
    \ with the original DSCP restored at the PCN-\n      egress.  This preserves the\
    \ ECN codepoint on these packets but\n      relies on there being spare local-use\
    \ DSCPs within the PCN-domain.\n"
