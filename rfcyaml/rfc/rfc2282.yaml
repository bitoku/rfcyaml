  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document supercedes RFC2027, the first complete specification\
    \ of\n   the process by which members of the IAB and IESG are selected,\n   confirmed,\
    \ and recalled.  Prior to that time, a single paragraph in\n   RFC1602 is the\
    \ extent to which the process had been formally\n   recorded.\n   This revision\
    \ is based on the experience of the 1996 Nominating\n   Committee, the first committee\
    \ to operate according to RFC2027.  The\n   following two assumptions of that\
    \ specification are also true for\n   this revision.\n    (1)   The Internet Research\
    \ Task Force (IRTF) and Internet Research\n          Steering Group (IRSG) are\
    \ not a part of the process described\n          here.\n    (2)   The organization\
    \ (and re-organization) of the IESG is not a\n          part of the process described\
    \ here.\n   The time frames specified here use IETF meetings as a frame of\n \
    \  reference.  The time frames assume that the IETF meets at least once\n   per\
    \ year with that meeting occurring during the North American Spring\n   time,\
    \ i.e., the IETF meets at least on or about March of each year.\n   The remainder\
    \ of this document is divided into four major topics as\n   follows.\n   General\n\
    \        This a set of rules and constraints that apply to the selection\n   \
    \     and confirmation process as a whole.\n   Nominating Committee Selection\n\
    \        This is the process by which volunteers from the IETF community\n   \
    \     are recognized to serve on the committee that nominates\n        candidates\
    \ to serve on the IESG and IAB.\n   Nominating Committee Operation\n        This\
    \ is the set of principles, rules, and constraints that guide\n        the activities\
    \ of the nominating committee, including the\n        confirmation process.\n\
    \   Member Recall\n        This is the process by which the behavior of a sitting\
    \ member of\n        the IESG or IAB may be questioned, perhaps resulting in the\n\
    \        removal of the sitting member.\n   A final section describes how this\
    \ document differs from its\n   predecessor: RFC2027.\n"
- title: 2.  General
  contents:
  - "2.  General\n   The following set of rules apply to the selection and confirmation\n\
    \   process as a whole.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the\n   interpretation\
    \ of each rule is included.\n    (1)   The principal functions of the nominating\
    \ committee are to\n          review the open IESG and IAB positions and to either\
    \ nominate\n          its incumbent or recruit a superior candidate.\n       \
    \ The nominating committee does not select the open positions to\n        be reviewed;\
    \ it is instructed as to which positions to review.\n        At a minimum, the\
    \ nominating committee will be given the title\n        of the position to be\
    \ reviewed.  The nominating committee may be\n        given a desirable set of\
    \ qualifications for the candidate\n        nominated to fill each position.\n\
    \        Incumbents must notify the nominating committee if they do not\n    \
    \    wish to be nominated.\n        The nominating committee does not confirm\
    \ its candidates; it\n        presents its candidates to the appropriate confirming\
    \ body as\n        indicated below.\n    (2)   The annual selection and confirmation\
    \ process is expected to\n          be completed within 3 months.\n        The\
    \ annual selection and confirmation process is expected to be\n        completed\
    \ one month prior to the friday of the week before the\n        Spring IETF. \
    \ It is expected to begin 4 months prior to the\n        friday of the week before\
    \ the Spring IETF.\n    (3)   One-half of each of the then current IESG and IAB\
    \ positions is\n          selected to be reviewed each year.\n        The intent\
    \ of this rule to ensure the review of approximately\n        one-half of each\
    \ of the sitting IESG and IAB members each year.\n        It is recognized that\
    \ circumstances may exist that will require\n        the nominating committee\
    \ to review more or less than one-half of\n        the current positions, e.g.,\
    \ if the IESG or IAB have re-\n        organized prior to this process and created\
    \ new positions, or if\n        there are an odd number current positions.\n \
    \   (4)   Confirmed candidates are expected to serve at least a 2 year\n     \
    \     term.\n        The intent of this rule is to ensure that members of the\
    \ IESG\n        and IAB serve the number of years that best facilitates the\n\
    \        review of one-half of the members each year.\n        It is consistent\
    \ with this rule for the nominating committee to\n        choose one or more of\
    \ the currently open positions to which it\n        may assign a term greater\
    \ than 2 years in order to ensure the\n        ideal application of this rule\
    \ in the future.\n        It is consistent with this rule for the nominating committee\
    \ to\n        choose one or more of the currently open positions that share\n\
    \        responsibilities with other positions (both those being reviewed\n  \
    \      and those sitting) to which it may assign a term greater than 2\n     \
    \   years to ensure that all such members will not be reviewed at\n        the\
    \ same time.\n        All member terms begin and end during the Spring IETF meeting\n\
    \        corresponding to the end of the term for which they were\n        confirmed.\
    \  Normally, the confirmed candidate's term begins when\n        the currently\
    \ sitting member's term ends on the last day of the\n        meeting.  A term\
    \ may begin or end no sooner than the first day\n        of the meeeting as determined\
    \ by the mutual agreement of the\n        currently sitting member and the confirmed\
    \ candidate.\n    (5)   Mid-term vacancies are filled by the same rules as documented\n\
    \          here with four qualifications.  First, the most recently\n        \
    \  constituted nominating committee is reconvened to nominate a\n          candidate\
    \ to fill the vacancy.  Second, the selection and\n          confirmation process\
    \ is expected to be completed within 1\n          month, with all other time periods\
    \ otherwise unspecified\n          prorated accordingly.  Third, the confirming\
    \ body has two\n          weeks from the day it is notified of a candidate to\
    \ reject the\n          candidate, otherwise the candidate is assumed to have\
    \ been\n          confirmed.  Fourth, the term of the confirmed candidate will\n\
    \          be either:\n   a.   the remainder of the term of the open position\
    \ if that remainder\n        is not less than one year.\n   b.   the remainder\
    \ of the term of the open position plus the next 2\n        year term if that\
    \ remainder is less than one year.\n    (6)   All deliberations and supporting\
    \ information that relates to\n          specific nominees, candidates, and confirmed\
    \ candidates are\n          confidential.\n        The nominating committee and\
    \ confirming body members will be\n        exposed to confidential information\
    \ as a result of their\n        deliberations, their interactions with those they\
    \ consult, and\n        from those who provide requested supporting information.\
    \  All\n        members and all other participants are expected to handle this\n\
    \        information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity.\n    (7)   Unless\
    \ otherwise specified, the advise and consent model is\n          used throughout\
    \ the process.  This model is characterized as\n          follows.\n   a.   The\
    \ IETF Executive Director advises the nominating committee of\n        the IESG\
    \ and IAB positions to be reviewed.\n   b.   The nominating committee selects\
    \ candidates and advises the\n        confirming bodies of them.\n   c.   The\
    \ sitting IAB members review the IESG candidates, consenting\n        to some,\
    \ all, or none.\n        If all of the candidates are confirmed, the job of the\n\
    \        nominating committee with respect to reviewing the open IESG\n      \
    \  positions is considered complete.  If some or none of the\n        candidates\
    \ are confirmed, the nominating committee must\n        reconvene to select alternate\
    \ candidates for the rejected\n        candidates.  Any additional time required\
    \ by the nominating\n        committee should not exceed its maximum time allotment.\n\
    \   d.   The Internet Society Board of Trustees reviews the IAB\n        candidates,\
    \ consenting to some, all, or none.\n        If all of the candidates are confirmed,\
    \ the job of the\n        nominating committee with respect to reviewing the open\
    \ IAB\n        positions is considered complete.  If some or none of the\n   \
    \     candidates are confirmed, the nominating committee must\n        reconvene\
    \ to select alternate candidates for the rejected\n        candidates.  Any additional\
    \ time required by the nominating\n        committee should not exceed its maximum\
    \ time allotment.\n   e.   The confirming bodies decide their consent according\
    \ to a\n        mechanism of their own choosing, which must ensure that at least\n\
    \        one-half of the sitting members agree with the decision.\n        At\
    \ least one-half of the sitting members of the confirming\n        bodies must\
    \ agree to either confirm or reject each individual\n        nominee.  The agreement\
    \ must be decided within a reasonable\n        timeframe.  The agreement may be\
    \ decided by conducting a formal\n        vote, by asserting consensus based on\
    \ informal exchanges\n        (email), or by whatever mechanism is used to conduct\
    \ the normal\n        business of the confirming body.\n   3.  Nominating Committee\
    \ Selection\n   The following set of rules apply to the creation of the nominating\n\
    \   committee and the selection of its members.\n    (1)   The committee is comprised\
    \ of at least a non-voting Chair, 10\n          voting volunteers, and 3 non-voting\
    \ liaisons.\n        A Chair is permitted to invite additional non-voting advisors\
    \ to\n        participate in some or all of the deliberations of the\n       \
    \ committee.\n    (2)   The Internet Society President appoints the non-voting\
    \ Chair,\n          who must meet the usual requirements for membership in the\n\
    \          nominating committee.\n        The nominating committee Chair must\
    \ agree to invest the time\n        necessary to complete the duties of the nominating\
    \ committee and\n        to perform in the best interests of the IETF community\
    \ during\n        the performance of those duties.\n    (3)   The Chair obtains\
    \ the list of IESG and IAB positions to be\n          reviewed and publishes it\
    \ along with a solicitation for names\n          of volunteers from the IETF community\
    \ willing to serve on the\n          nominating committee.\n        The list of\
    \ open positions is published with the solicitation to\n        facilitate community\
    \ members choosing between volunteering for\n        an open position and volunteering\
    \ for the nominating committee.\n        The list and solicitation must be publicized\
    \ using at least the\n        same mechanism used by the IETF secretariat for\
    \ its\n        announcements.\n    (4)   Members of the IETF community must have\
    \ attended at least 2 of\n          the last 3 IETF meetings in order to volunteer.\n\
    \    (5)   Internet Society Board of Trustees, sitting members of the\n      \
    \    IAB, and sitting members of the IESG may not volunteer.\n    (6)   The Chair\
    \ announces the pool of volunteers from which the 10\n          voting volunteers\
    \ will be randomly selected.\n        The announcement must be made using at least\
    \ the same mechanism\n        used by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.\n\
    \    (7)   The Chair randomly selects the 10 voting voluteers from the\n     \
    \     pool of names of volunteers using a method that can be\n          independently\
    \ verified to be unbiased and fair.\n        A method is fair if each eligible\
    \ volunteer is equally likely to\n        be selected.  A method is unbiased if\
    \ no one can influence its\n        outcome.\n        The method must include\
    \ an announcement of an enumerated list of\n        the pool of names together\
    \ with the specific algorithm for how\n        names will be chosen from the list.\
    \  The output of the selection\n        algorithm must depend on random data whose\
    \ value is not known at\n        the time the list and algorithm are announced.\n\
    \        One possible method is to compute the MD5 hash of future winning\n  \
    \      lottery numbers and use the result to select names from the\n        list.\n\
    \        All announcements must be made using at least the mechanism used\n  \
    \      by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.\n    (8)   The sitting IAB\
    \ and IESG members each appoint a non-voting\n          liaison to the nominating\
    \ committee from their current\n          membership who are not sitting in an\
    \ open position.\n    (9)   The Chair of the prior year's nominating committee\
    \ serves as a\n          non-voting liaison.\n        The prior year's Chair may\
    \ designate an alternate voting member\n        from the prior year's committee\
    \ if the Chair is unavailable.  If\n        the prior year's Chair is unavailable\
    \ and is unable or unwilling\n        to make such a designation in a timely fashion,\
    \ the Chair of the\n        current committee may do so.\n    (10)  The Chair\
    \ may solicit additional non-voting liaisons from\n          other organizations,\
    \ who must meet the usual requirements for\n          membership in the nominating\
    \ committee.\n"
- title: 4.  Nominating Committee Operation
  contents:
  - "4.  Nominating Committee Operation\n   The following rules apply to the operation\
    \ of the nominating\n   committee.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation\n\
    \   of each rule is included.\n   The rules are organized approximately in the\
    \ order in which they\n   would be invoked.\n   The term nominee refers to an\
    \ individual under consideration by the\n   nominating committee.  The term candidate\
    \ refers to a nominee that\n   has been selected by the nominating committee to\
    \ be considered for\n   confirmation by a confirming body.  A confirmed candidate\
    \ is a\n   candidate that has been reviewed and approved by a confirming body.\n\
    \    (1)   All rules and special circumstances not otherwise specified\n     \
    \     are at the discretion of the Chair.\n        Exceptional circumstances will\
    \ occasionally arise during the\n        normal operation of the nominating committee.\
    \  This rule is\n        intended to foster the continued forward progress of\
    \ the\n        committee.  All members of the committee should consider whether\n\
    \        the exception is worthy of mention in the next revision of this\n   \
    \     document and followup accordingly.\n    (2)   The Chair must establish and\
    \ publicize milestones, which must\n          include at least a call for nominations.\n\
    \        There is a defined time period during which the selection and\n     \
    \   confirmation process must be completed.  The Chair must\n        establish\
    \ a set of milestones which, if met in a timely fashion,\n        will result\
    \ in the completion of the process on time.  The Chair\n        should allow time\
    \ for iterating the activities of the committee\n        if one or more candidates\
    \ is not confirmed.\n        The milestones must be publicized using at least\
    \ the same\n        mechanism used by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.\n\
    \    (3)   The Chair must establish a voting mechanism.\n        The committee\
    \ must be able to objectively determine when a\n        decision has been made\
    \ during its deliberations.  The criteria\n        for determining closure must\
    \ be established and known to all\n        members of the nominating committee.\n\
    \    (4)   At least a quorum of committee members must participate in a\n    \
    \      vote.  A quorum is comprised of at least 7 voting members.\n    (5)   The\
    \ Chair may establish a process by which a member of the\n          nominating\
    \ committee may be recalled.\n        The process, if established, must be agreed\
    \ to by a 3/4 majority\n        of the members of the nominating committee, including\
    \ the non-\n        voting members since they would be subject to the same process.\n\
    \    (6)   All members of the nominating committee may participate in all\n  \
    \        deliberations.\n        The emphasis of this rule is that no member,\
    \ whether voting or\n        non-voting, can be explicitly excluded from any deliberation.\n\
    \        However, a member may individually choose not to participate in\n   \
    \     a deliberation.\n    (7)   The Chair announces the open positions to be\
    \ reviewed and the\n          call for nominees.\n        The call for nominees\
    \ must include a request for comments\n        regarding the past performance\
    \ of incumbents, which will be\n        considered during the deliberations of\
    \ the nominating committee.\n        The announcements must be publicized using\
    \ at least the same\n        mechanism used by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.\n\
    \    (8)   Any member of the IETF community may nominate any member of\n     \
    \     the IETF community for any open position.\n        A self-nomination is\
    \ permitted.\n    (9)   Nominating committee members must not be nominees.\n \
    \       To be a nominee is to enter the process of being selected as a\n     \
    \   candidate and confirmed.  Nominating committee members are not\n        eligible\
    \ to be considered for filling any open position.\n    (10)  Members of the IETF\
    \ community who were recalled from any IESG\n          or IAB position during\
    \ the previous two years must not be\n          nominees.\n    (11)  The nominating\
    \ committee selects candidates based on its\n          understanding of the IETF\
    \ community's consensus of the\n          qualifications required to fill the\
    \ open positions.\n        The intent of this rule is to ensure that the nominating\n\
    \        committee consults with a broad base of the IETF community for\n    \
    \    input to its deliberations.\n        The consultations are permitted to include\
    \ a slate of nominees,\n        if all parties to the consultation agree to observe\
    \ customary\n        and reasonable rules of confidentiality.\n        A broad\
    \ base of the community should include the existing\n        members of the IAB\
    \ and IESG, especially sitting members who\n        share responsibilities with\
    \ open positions, e.g., co-Area\n        Directors.\n    (12)  Nominees should\
    \ be advised that they are being considered and\n          must consent to their\
    \ nomination prior to being confirmed.\n        The nominating committee should\
    \ help nominees provide\n        justification to their employers.\n        A\
    \ nominee's consent must be written (email is acceptable) and\n        include\
    \ a commitment to provide the resources necessary to fill\n        the open position\
    \ and an assurance that the nominee will perform\n        the duties of the position\
    \ for which they are being considered\n        in the best interests of the IETF\
    \ community.\n    (13)  The nominating committee advises the confirming bodies\
    \ of\n          their candidates, specifying a single candidate for each open\n\
    \          position and a testament as to how each candidate meets the\n     \
    \     qualifications of an open position.\n        The testament may include a\
    \ brief resume of the candidate and a\n        summary of the deliberations of\
    \ the nominating committee.\n    (14)  With respect to any action to be taken\
    \ in the context of\n          notifying and announcing confirmed candidates,\
    \ and notifying\n          rejected nominees and candidates, the action must be\
    \ valid\n          according to all of the rules specified below prior to its\n\
    \          execution.\n   a.   Up until a candidate is confirmed, the identity\
    \ of the candidate\n        must be kept confidential.\n   b.   The identity of\
    \ all nominees must be kept confidential (except\n        that the nominee may\
    \ publicize their intentions).\n   c.   Rejected nominees may be notified as soon\

    \ candidates may be notified and announced as soon as\n        they are confirmed.\n\
    \        It is consistent with these rules for a nominee to never know if\n  \
    \      they were a candidate or not.\n        It is consistent with these rules\
    \ for some nominees to be\n        rejected early in the process and for some\
    \ nominees to be kept\n        as alternates in case a candidate is rejected by\
    \ a confirming\n        body.  In the matter of whether a confirmed candidate\
    \ was a\n        first choice or an alternate, that information need not ever\
    \ be\n        disclosed and, in fact, probably never should be.\n        It is\
    \ consistent with these rules for confirmed candidates to be\n        notified\
    \ and announced as quickly as possible instead of\n        requiring all confirmed\
    \ candidates to wait until all open\n        positions have been reviewed.\n \
    \       When consulting with individual members of the IETF community,\n     \
    \   if all parties to the consultation agree to observe customary\n        and\
    \ reasonable rules of confidentiality the consultations are\n        permitted\
    \ to include a slate of nominees.\n        The announcements must be publicized\
    \ using at least the same\n        mechanism used by the IETF secretariat for\
    \ its announcements.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  Member Recall\n   The following rules apply to the recall process.  If necessary,\
    \ a\n   paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is included.\n  \
    \  (1)   Anyone may request the recall of any sitting IAB or IESG\n          member,\
    \ at any time, upon written (email is acceptable)\n          request with justification\
    \ to the Internet Society President.\n    (2)   Internet Society President shall\
    \ appoint a Recall Committee\n          Chair.\n        The Internet Society President\
    \ must not evaluate the recall\n        request.  It is explicitly the responsibility\
    \ of the IETF\n        community to evaluate the behavior of its leaders.\n  \
    \  (3)   The recall committee is created according to the same rules as\n    \
    \      is the nominating committee with the qualifications that the\n        \
    \  person being investigated and the person requesting the recall\n          must\
    \ not be a member of the recall committee in any capacity.\n    (4)   The recall\
    \ committee operates according to the same rules as\n          the nominating\
    \ committee with the qualification that there is\n          no confirmation process.\n\
    \    (5)   The recall committee investigates the circumstances of the\n      \
    \    justification for the recall and votes on its findings.\n        The investigation\
    \ must include at least both an opportunity for\n        the member being recalled\
    \ to present a written statement and\n        consultation with third parties.\n\
    \    (6)   A 3/4 majority of the members who vote on the question is\n       \
    \   required for a recall.\n    (7)   If a sitting member is recalled the open\
    \ position is to be\n          filled according to the mid-term vacancy rules.\n"
