  - "1.  Introduction\n   The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)\
    \ was created\n   by international agreement in 1947.  ISO is a network of the\
    \ national\n   standards institutes of many countries, on the basis of one member\n\
    \   per country, with a Central Secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland, that\n   coordinates\
    \ the system.  ISO acts as a bridging organization in which\n   a consensus can\
    \ be reached on solutions that meet both the\n   requirements of business and\
    \ the broader needs of society, such as\n   the needs of stakeholder groups like\
    \ consumers and users.\n   Further information is provided at http://www.iso.org/iso/about.htm.\n\
    \   The core mission of ISO is to develop technical standards\n   constituting\
    \ technical agreements that provide the framework for\n   compatible technology\
    \ worldwide.  ISO standards contribute to making\n   the development, manufacturing,\
    \ and supply of products and services\n   more efficient, safer, and cleaner.\
    \  They make trade between\n   countries easier and fairer.\n   Every participating\
    \ ISO member institute (full members) has the right\n   to take part in the development\
    \ of any standard that it judges to be\n   important to its country's economy.\
    \  No matter what the size or\n   strength of that economy, each participating\
    \ member in ISO has one\n   vote.  ISO's activities are thus carried out in a\
    \ democratic\n   framework where each country is on an equal footing to influence\
    \ the\n   direction of ISO's work at the strategic level, as well as the\n   technical\
    \ content of its individual standards.  Although the ISO\n   standards are voluntary,\
    \ the fact that they are developed in response\n   to market demand, and are based\
    \ on consensus among the interested\n   parties, ensures widespread applicability\
    \ of the standards.\n   Consensus, like technology, evolves and ISO takes account\
    \ of both\n   evolving technology and evolving interests by requiring a review\
    \ of\n   its standards at least every five years to decide whether they should\n\
    \   be maintained, updated, or withdrawn.\n   ISO publishes International Standards\
    \ and other technical\n   specifications that are cited in the definitions of\
    \ required or\n   expected practices in many industries in many nations.  These\n\
    \   specifications contain dictionaries of standard terms, catalogues of\n   reference\
    \ values, definitions of formal languages, formal schemata\n   for information\
    \ capture and exchange, specifications for standard\n   practices, and other information\
    \ resources of general use to\n   international trade and industry.  ISO wishes\
    \ to create and manage\n   globally unique, persistent, location-independent identifiers\
    \ for\n   these resources.\n   This specification defines the syntax for URNs\
    \ that identify\n   documents developed by the International Organization for\n\
    \   Standardization (ISO) in accordance with the standards development\n   procedures\
    \ defined in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1 [ISODIR-1] and\n   the ISO supplement\
    \ [ISODIR-S] and processed by the ISO Central\n   Secretariat.  The syntax extends\
    \ to identify document metadata and\n   resources related to these documents or\
    \ otherwise associated with\n   them.  It does not extend to products derived\
    \ from these documents\n   and published by ISO (e.g., handbooks, compendia) or\
    \ documents at or\n   below the Technical Committee level.  Revisions of this\
    \ specification\n   may define syntax for URNs in this namespace that identify\
    \ other ISO\n   objects, when the ISO community defines a requirement for such\n\
    \   identifiers.\n"

  - "2.4.1.  Definition\n   The Namespace Specific Strings (NSSs) of all URNs assigned\
    \ by ISO\n   will conform to the syntax defined in Section 2.2 of [RFC2141].\n\
    \   The NSS has the following ABNF [RFC5234] specification:\n   NSS          \
    \ = std-nss\n      All URNs conforming to this specification begin the NSS with\
    \ the\n      prefix \"std:\" to denote the restriction to documents developed\
    \ by\n      the ISO standards development procedures as defined in the ISO/IEC\n\
    \      Directives, Part 1 [ISODIR-1] and the ISO Supplement [ISODIR-S].\n    \
    \  Prefixes that identify ISO objects of other kinds may be defined\n      in\

    \ *supplement *docelement\n                      [addition]\n      The prefix\
    \ \"std:\" distinguishes an <std-nss>.  An <std-nss>\n      identifies the ISO\
    \ document that is designated by the\n      <docidentifier>, as extended or modified\
    \ by any identified\n      <supplement>.  (An <std-nss> that identifies all parts\
    \ of a\n      multipart ISO document is a special case as described under the\n\
    \      element <partnumber>.)  If the <std-nss> contains an <addition>\n     \

    \ is identified by\n      <partnumber>.\n   partnumber    = \"-\" 1*( DIGIT /\

    \ a part of a\n      multipart standard.\n      Where it is required to refer\
    \ to a multipart ISO document in its\n      entirety, this can be designated by\
    \ omitting the <partnumber>\n      element.  However, this precludes the possibility\
    \ of using any\n      further elements except <addition>.\n      NOTE: The option\
    \ to refer to a multipart ISO document by omitting\n      the <partnumber> element\
    \ has been included to align with the\n      provision in the ISO/IEC Directives,\
    \ Part 2, 2004 [ISODIR-2]\n      subclause 6.2.2 of making an undated reference\
    \ to all parts of an\n      ISO document.  It is only permissible to use this\
    \ option where the\n      URN is referring to a multipart ISO document in its\
    \ entirety.\n      Since the use of this option precludes the designation of the\n\
    \      elements <status> and <edition>, it is implicit that the URN needs\n  \
    \    to remain valid irrespective of any future changes to the\n      multipart\
    \ document (see the rules for undated references given in\n      the ISO/IEC Directives,\
    \ Part 2, 2004 [ISODIR-2] subclause\n      6.6.7.5.2).  This shall be taken into\
    \ consideration in the use\n      (and maintenance) of any URN specification employing\
    \ this option.\n      NOTE: In the case where the multipart document comprises\
    \ different\n      types of ISO deliverable, the <type> of the core part (usually\n\
    \      part 1) applies.  See the example \"Reference to a resource related\n \
    \     to all parts of a multipart document\".\n      Except for the case where\
    \ it is required to refer to a multipart\n      document in its entirety, the\
    \ element <partnumber> is required if\n      the identified resource is a part\
    \ of an ISO document.  Otherwise,\n      this element is not used.\n   status\
    \        = ( \"draft\" / \"cancelled\" ) / stage\n      <status> indicates the\
    \ publication status of the document.  When\n      the <status> element is not\
    \ present, the NSS refers to a published\n      document.  Other values:\n   \
    \   draft     = document that has not yet been accepted for\n                \
    \  publication by international ballot\n      cancelled = document that has been\

    \ code in accordance with ISO\n      Guide 69:1999, \"Harmonized Stage Code system\

    \   o  globally unique, persistent identifiers\n   o  location-independent identifiers\n\
    \   o  human-interpretable identifiers\n   o  a scheme applicable to paper documents\
    \ as well as machine-readable\n      documents\n   o  a scheme applicable to conceptual\
    \ documents and explicit forms of\n      documents\n   o  a scheme applicable\
    \ to resources extracted from documents\n   o  a scheme applicable to \"metadata\"\
    \ associated with documents\n   o  a scheme in which the identifier assignment\
    \ is managed by the ISO\n      Central Secretariat\n   Location-independence:\
    \ Because the publication of ISO standards is a\n   complex arrangement involving\
    \ multiple development organizations and\n   national standards institutes, a\
    \ given ISO document may be available\n   in a number of forms from a number of\
    \ sources.  This makes it\n   important to have a document identifier that is\
    \ global in scope,\n   widely and uniformly used, and independent of the text\
    \ source used by\n   any given reference.\n   Human-interpretable: Many, perhaps\
    \ most, references to documents\n   appear in text generated by human authors.\
    \  It is important that an\n   author familiar with the scheme be able to generate\
    \ a correct URN for\n   a document for which the author has the ISO reference\
    \ (or document\n   identifier).  Conversely, it is important that a reader unfamiliar\n\
    \   with the scheme be able to identify the URN as a reference to an ISO\n   document,\
    \ particularly an ISO standard, and also to recognize\n   identifiers for forms,\
    \ languages, or metadata sets.\n   Paper documents: Older ISO standards that are\
    \ commonly used as\n   industrial references exist only in paper form or in earlier\n\
    \   machine-readable forms that are not commonly used on the Internet.\n   It\
    \ is important to have a document identifier scheme that extends to\n   these\
    \ resources as well.  (In fact, many of these have been converted\n   to Internet\
    \ forms, and others are being converted, but it is\n   important that the identifier\
    \ be independent of the form in which the\n   document can be obtained at any\
    \ given time.)\n   Conceptual documents vs. representation forms: Because ISO\
    \ documents\n   are regularly maintained and re-published in multiple forms, it\
    \ is\n   important to have document identifiers that denote the conceptual\n \
    \  document, without regard to publication form.  At the same time, it\n   is\
    \ necessary for certain types of use to be able to refer to specific\n   editions,\
    \ or specific publication forms (for example, editions in\n   different languages,\
    \ or to PDF or HTML versions).  This URN\n   specification allows for the identification\
    \ of these different types\n   of use in the <isodefined> part of the <addition>\
    \ element.\n   Document extracts: ISO standards may contain formal specifications\
    \ in\n   machine-processable languages, or formal specifications that also\n \
    \  have representations in machine-processable languages.  It is useful\n   to\
    \ be able to extract these specifications in machine-processable\n   form as separate\
    \ resources, and therefore it is necessary to give\n   these \"extracted resources\"\
    \ global identifiers derived from the\n   document identifier using a consistent\
    \ identification scheme.\n   Document metadata: Certain uses of documents and\
    \ document text,\n   primarily bibliographic, also extract information from the\
    \ documents,\n   and that information, commonly called \"metadata\", is organized\
    \ in\n   machine-readable forms conforming to other standards.  These metadata\n\
    \   sets then become resources in their own right.  It is important to\n   give\
    \ them URN identifiers consistent with the document identification\n   scheme.\n"
- title: 4.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Community Considerations\n   The ISO community is broad in two dimensions.\
    \  In one dimension, its\n   documents are developed and used in a large variety\
    \ of industries and\n   professions: natural sciences, manufacturing, construction,\n\
    \   transportation, information technology, social sciences, etc.  In the\n  \
    \ other dimension, it is a community of expert developers, standards\n   managers,\
    \ publishers, professional users, and consumers.  And\n   Internet information\
    \ technologies are a part of common professional\n   practice in all of these\
    \ areas in both dimensions.\n   ISO standards are cited in business agreements,\
    \ in professional\n   publications, in product descriptions, and in standards\
    \ development\n   and publication activities.  When these citations appear in\n\
    \   electronic form, the references must be unambiguous.\n   The information technology\
    \ community is itself very active in the\n   development and use of standards,\
    \ and many ISO publications are\n   developed by and for that community.  When\
    \ an Internet information\n   exchange uses a form specified in an ISO document,\
    \ or a terminology\n   defined in an ISO document, it is often necessary to identify\
    \ that\n   ISO specification in the envelope surrounding the exchange.  That\n\
    \   identification should use a formal, unambiguous identifier in a form\n   readily\
    \ recognized by the receiving software, and possibly by the\n   ultimate human\
    \ recipient of the information.\n   In order to facilitate the use of existing\
    \ and emerging Internet\n   technologies for all of these purposes, URNs conforming\
    \ to [RFC2141]\n   represent the most useful form of formal, globally unambiguous\n\
    \   identifiers.  The use of a managed namespace for such identifiers,\n   following\
    \ a consistent scheme for identifying ISO documents and their\n   derivatives,\
    \ would be of significant benefit to the entire ISO\n   community.\n      It would\
    \ give professional users in many industries a standard\n      form for electronic\
    \ reference to ISO standards in HTML, XML, PDF,\n      etc., documents.\n    \
    \  It would give software developers a standard form for reference to\n      ISO\
    \ standard protocols, schemata, languages, data sets, etc.\n      It would give\
    \ standards developers a standard form for reference\n      to other ISO publications\
    \ in various stages of development.  And\n      it would give them a standard\
    \ form for creating identifiers for\n      machine-readable information sets contained\
    \ in, or derived from,\n      the specifications.\n      It would give standards\
    \ managers and publishers a formal uniform\n      scheme for reference to specific\
    \ publications, editions, and\n      versions of ISO documents.\n   While the\
    \ assignment of identifiers under this scheme is managed by\n   the ISO Central\
    \ Secretariat, the processes by which the identified\n   objects arise and acquire\
    \ such identifiers are the result of\n   agreements made by the member bodies.\
    \  Every such project is\n   initiated by one member body and reviewed and voted\
    \ on by the others.\n   Every accepted project is open to participation by any\
    \ member body,\n   and in fact, participation by a certain minimum number (usually\
    \ 5) of\n   member bodies is required for acceptance of most projects.  In\n \
    \  general, the member bodies are open professional and industrial\n   organizations\
    \ reflecting broad expertise and national interest.\n   It should be noted that\
    \ ISO documents in draft state are not usually\n   made available outside the\
    \ ISO standards development community.\n   Making them available to professionals\
    \ outside of the process might\n   well mislead the recipients into premature\
    \ adoption of practices that\n   are not yet completely specified or have not\
    \ yet achieved consensus,\n   and therefore may well change.\n   It should also\
    \ be noted that ISO documents are not, in general,\n   freely available over the\
    \ Internet.  Rather, there are complex\n   agreements between ISO and its member\
    \ institutes as to the rights to\n   the publications and the corresponding fees\
    \ that may be charged for\n   paper or electronic copies of various editions.\
    \  Some ISO documents\n   are freely available, and some are freely available\
    \ in certain forms.\n   In general, derivatives of ISO documents (schemata, metadata\
    \ sets,\n   etc.) are freely available over the Internet in the appropriate\n\
    \   machine-readable forms.  A URL associated with a URN in the requested\n  \
    \ namespace may therefore lead directly to a machine-readable copy of\n   the\
    \ text of the document or derivative, or it may lead to a site that\n   can provide\
    \ that text for a fee, or it may lead to a site that can\n   only sell a paper\
    \ copy of the document.  Bearing in mind that ISO is\n   a network of otherwise\
    \ independent institutes, this behavior is\n   simply a property of the ISO community.\n\
    \   Finally, it should be noted that, for many purposes, reference to the\n  \
    \ ISO standard is what is required, and only the product engineer or\n   software\
    \ tool builder actually needs access to the text.  This\n   request is based on\
    \ the need to standardize the form of reference,\n   not the means of access.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Alternative Naming Schemes
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Alternative Naming Schemes\n   Before initiating this request, ISO\
    \ attempted to find an existing or\n   currently proposed URN NID scheme that\
    \ might be used instead of a\n   dedicated scheme.  Two existing schemes were\
    \ carefully considered\n   because they clearly meet part of the requirements:\n\
    \   o  The OID scheme, documented in [RFC3061]\n   o  The PublicId scheme, documented\
    \ in [RFC3151]\n   The OID scheme is derived from the joint ISO/ITU-T ASN.1\n\
    \   object-identifier scheme specified in [ISO/IEC8824-1:2002] (original\n   edition\
    \ 1984; [RFC3061] cites the 1988 [CCITT] edition of the\n   encoding rules in\
    \ [ISO/IEC8825:1987].  This standard assigned the\n   registry authority for all\
    \ identifiers in the { iso(1) } namespace to\n   ISO, and therefore, ISO controls\
    \ the registry of all identifiers\n   beginning \"oid:1:\".  And in fact, ISO\
    \ has developed, and is using, an\n   identification scheme under ASN.1 that meets\
    \ most of the above\n   requirements.  ISO could clearly define a use of the OID\
    \ scheme that\n   would be adequate to meet all of its technical objectives, although\n\
    \   it would further complicate the current ASN.1 scheme.\n   The original intent\
    \ of ISO 8824 was to permit both a human-readable\n   form for the identifier,\
    \ to maximize intuitive recognition, and an\n   encoding that minimized the number\
    \ of bits needed to communicate an\n   OID value over a network.  Regrettably,\
    \ the encoding chosen in RFC\n   3061 is much closer to the minimal bits encoding\
    \ than to the\n   human-readable one.  The NSS for the OID scheme consists entirely\
    \ of\n   digits and punctuation.  For example, the ASN.1 identifier { iso(1)\n\
    \   standard(0) 7852 part(2) edition(3) } becomes: urn:oid:1:0:7852:2:3.\n   This\
    \ is difficult for a human reader or author to interpret.  It is\n   also easy\
    \ to mistype, and the scheme contains no \"check-digits\",\n   which makes it\
    \ difficult to validate, leading to the propagation of\n   URNS that are invalid\
    \ or valid but erroneous.  Finally, the\n   all-numeric form conveys no hint of\
    \ the name of the responsible\n   organization, and therefore no hint of any URL\
    \ that might aid a human\n   reader in interpreting the reference.  The OID scheme\
    \ makes all of\n   the required identifiers technically possible and technically\
    \ useable\n   by software, but for all practical purposes, the OID URNs are useful\n\
    \   only to software.\n   The PublicId scheme is derived from Standard Generalized\
    \ Markup\n   Language (SGML) [ISO8879:1986] and [ISO/IEC9070:1991] bibliographic\n\
    \   catalogue forms.  Narrowed to ISO publications, it is adequate for\n   the\
    \ unique global persistent identification of published documents,\n   in both\
    \ paper and machine-processable form.\n   Importantly, the PublicId scheme does\
    \ not have a \"conceptual\n   document\" notion -- it identifies specific publications\
    \ and editions.\n   \"Weak identification\" could be used to implement the conceptual\n\
    \   document concept, but the PublicId scheme does not document that\n   interpretation.\
    \  In any case, the PublicId scheme does not extend to\n   draft documents, which\
    \ are often referenced in pilot implementations,\n   to separate forms of a document,\
    \ or to resources extracted from\n   documents.  It supports only those metadata\
    \ elements that are defined\n   in SGML.  The scheme could be extended to do most\
    \ of these, but the\n   ISO-specific extensions would not in general extend to\
    \ the much\n   broader base of documents identified by PublicIds.  (Version and\n\
    \   edition management practices vary significantly across publishers,\n   depending\
    \ on their milieu.)  Further, the ISO Central Secretariat\n   could not and should\
    \ not control the registry of such URNs.\n   ISO therefore concluded that the\
    \ alternative schemes are not adequate\n   to meet the requirements of the ISO\
    \ community.\n   Whilst requesting a new namespace for ISO documents and their\n\
    \   derivatives, ISO does not wish to discourage the use of these other\n   identifiers\
    \ for ISO publications.  The PublicId form, in particular,\n   is useful for referring\
    \ to ISO publications in a larger bibliographic\n   information space.\n"
