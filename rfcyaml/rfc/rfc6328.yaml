- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Some protocols being developed or extended by the IETF make\
    \ use of\n   the ISO/IEC (International Organization for Standardization /\n \
    \  International Electrotechnical Commission) Network Layer Protocol\n   Identifier\
    \ (NLPID).\n   The term \"NLPID\" is not actually used in [ISO9577], which refers\
    \ to\n   one-octet IPIs (Initial Protocol Identifiers) and SPIs (Subsequent\n\
    \   Protocol Identifiers).  While these are two logically separate kinds\n   of\
    \ one-octet identifiers, most values are usable as both an IPI and\n   an SPI.\
    \  In the remainder of this document, the term NLPID is used\n   for such values.\n\
    \   The registry of NLPID values is maintained by ISO/IEC by updating\n   [ISO9577].\
    \  The procedure specified by ISO/IEC in that document is\n   that an NLPID code\
    \ point can be allocated without approval by\n   ISO/IEC, as long as the code\
    \ point is not in a range of values\n   categorized for an organization other\
    \ than the organization\n   allocating the code point and as long as ISO/IEC JTC1\
    \ SC6 is\n   informed.\n   This document provides NLPID IANA considerations. \
    \ That is, it\n   specifies the level of IETF approval necessary for a code point\
    \ to be\n   allocated for IETF use, the procedures to be used and actions to be\n\
    \   taken by IANA in connection with NLPIDs, and related guidelines.\n   [RFC5226]\
    \ is incorporated herein except to the extent that there are\n   contrary provisions\
    \ in this document.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  NLPIDs
  contents:
  - "2.  NLPIDs\n   [ISO9577] defines one-octet network layer protocol identifiers\
    \ that\n   are commonly called NLPIDs, which is the term used in this document.\n\
    \   NLPIDs are used in a number of protocols.  For example, in the\n   mar$pro.type\
    \ field of the multicast address resolution server\n   protocol [RFC2022], the\
    \ ar$pro.type field of the NBMA (Non-Broadcast\n   Multi-Access) next hop resolution\
    \ protocol [RFC2332] and in the IS-IS\n   Protocols Supported TLV [RFC1195]. \

- title: 2.2.  Code Point 0x80
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Code Point 0x80\n   NLPID 0x80 is known as the IEEE (Institute of Electrical\
    \ &\n   Electronics Engineers) SNAP (SubNetwork Access Protocol) code point.\n\
    \   It is followed by five octets, using the IEEE SNAP SAP (Service\n   Access\
    \ Point) conventions, to specify the protocol.  Those\n   conventions are described\
    \ in Section 3 of [RFC5342].  In particular,\n   it is valid for such a five-octet\
    \ sequence to start with the IANA OUI\n   (Organizationally Unique Identifier)\
    \ followed by two further octets\n   assigned by IANA as provided in [RFC5342].\
    \  The same IANA registry is\n   used for such protocol identifiers whether they\
    \ are planned to be\n   introduced by the 0x80 NLPID or the IEEE SNAP SAP LSAPs\
    \ (Link-Layer\n   Service Access Points) (0xAAAA).  Values allocated by IANA may\
    \ be\n   used in either context as appropriate.\n   Because of the limited number\
    \ of NLPID code points available for IANA\n   allocation, use of the IEEE SNAP\
    \ NLPID is RECOMMENDED rather than\n   allocation of a new one-octet NLPID code\
    \ point.\n"
- title: 2.3.  NLPIDs Available for IANA Allocation
  contents:
  - "2.3.  NLPIDs Available for IANA Allocation\n   A limited number of code points\
    \ are available that could be allocated\n   by IANA under [ISO9577].  Because\
    \ of this, it is desirable, where\n   practical, to use code point 0x80, as discussed\
    \ in Section 2.2 above,\n   or to get code points allocated from the ranges categorized\
    \ to other\n   organizations.  For example, code point 0x8E was allocated for\
    \ IPv6\n   [RFC2460], although it is in a range of code points categorized for\n\
    \   ISO/IEC.  One-byte code points are assigned to TRILL and IEEE 802.1aq\n  \
    \ as they are intended for use within the IS-IS Protocols Supported TLV\n   [RFC1195].\n\
    \   The table below, which includes two new code point allocations made\n   by\
    \ this document, shows those still available.\n      Code Point  Status\n    \

- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   As long as code points are available, IANA will allocate\
    \ additional\n   values when required by applying the IETF Review policy as per\n\
    \   [RFC5226].\n   Whenever it allocates an NLPID, IANA will inform the IETF liaison\
    \ to\n   ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6 (Joint Technical Committee 1, Study Committee 6)\n \
    \  [JTC1SC6], or if IANA is unable to determine that IETF liaison, the\n   IAB.\
    \  The liaison (or the IAB) will then ensure that ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6\n   is informed\
    \ so that [ISO9577] can be updated since ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6\n   is the body that\
    \ maintains [ISO9577].  To simplify this process, it\n   is desirable that the\
    \ IAB maintain an IETF liaison to ISO/IEC JTC1\n   SC6.\n   This document allocates\
    \ the code points 0xC0 and 0xC1 as shown in\n   Section 2.3 and IANA shall request\
    \ the liaison (or the IAB) to so\n   inform ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6.\n   IANA maintains\
    \ a web page showing NLPIDs that have been allocated to\n   a protocol being developed\
    \ or extended by the IETF or are otherwise\n   of interest.  The initial state\
    \ of the web page is as shown in\n   Appendix A.  IANA will update this web page\
    \ for (1) NLPIDs allocated\n   by IANA and (2) other allocations or de-allocations\
    \ when IANA is\n   requested to make such changes to this web page by the IETF\
    \ liaison\n   mentioned above.\n"
