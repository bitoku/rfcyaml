  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) provides replicated distributed\
    \ secure\n   hierarchical databases that store \"resource records\" (RRs) under\n\
    \   domain names.  DNS data is structured into CLASSes and zones that can\n  \
    \ be independently maintained.  Familiarity with [RFC1034], [RFC1035],\n   [RFC2136],\
    \ [RFC2181], and [RFC4033] is assumed.\n   This document provides, either directly\
    \ or by reference, the general\n   IANA parameter assignment considerations that\
    \ apply across DNS query\n   and response headers and all RRs.  There may be additional\
    \ IANA\n   considerations that apply to only a particular RRTYPE or\n   query/response\
    \ OpCode.  See the specific RFC defining that RRTYPE or\n   query/response OpCode\
    \ for such considerations if they have been\n   defined, except for AFSDB RR considerations\
    \ [RFC1183], which are\n   included herein.  This RFC obsoletes [RFC6195]; however,\
    \ the only\n   significant changes are those to the RRTYPE IANA allocation process,\n\
    \   aimed at streamlining it and clarifying the expected behavior of the\n   parties\
    \ involved, and the closing of the AFSDB subtype registry.\n   IANA currently\
    \ maintains a web page of DNS parameters available from\n   <http://www.iana.org>.\n"

    \   The ID field identifies the query and is echoed in the response so\n   they\
    \ can be matched.\n   The QR bit indicates whether the header is for a query or\
    \ a response.\n   The AA, TC, RD, RA, and CD bits are each theoretically meaningful\n\
    \   only in queries or only in responses, depending on the bit.  The AD\n   bit\
    \ was only meaningful in responses but is expected to have a\n   separate but\
    \ related meaning in queries (see Section 5.7 of\n   [RFC6840]).  Only the RD\
    \ and CD bits are expected to be copied from\n   the query to the response; however,\
    \ some DNS implementations copy all\n   the query header as the initial value\
    \ of the response header.  Thus,\n   any attempt to use a \"query\" bit with a\
    \ different meaning in a\n   response or to define a query meaning for a \"response\"\
    \ bit may be\n   dangerous, given the existing implementation.  Meanings for these\n\
    \   bits may only be assigned by a Standards Action.\n   The unsigned integer\
    \ fields query count (QDCOUNT), answer count\n   (ANCOUNT), authority count (NSCOUNT),\
    \ and additional information\n   count (ARCOUNT) express the number of records\
    \ in each section for all\n   OpCodes except Update [RFC2136].  These fields have\
    \ the same\n   structure and data type for Update but are instead the counts for\
    \ the\n   zone (ZOCOUNT), prerequisite (PRCOUNT), update (UPCOUNT), and\n   additional\
    \ information (ARCOUNT) sections.\n"
- title: 2.1.  One Spare Bit?
  contents:
  - "2.1.  One Spare Bit?\n   There have been ancient DNS implementations for which\
    \ the Z bit being\n   on in a query meant that only a response from the primary\
    \ server for\n   a zone is acceptable.  It is believed that current DNS\n   implementations\
    \ ignore this bit.\n   Assigning a meaning to the Z bit requires a Standards Action.\n"
- title: 2.2.  OpCode Assignment
  contents:
  - "2.2.  OpCode Assignment\n   Currently, DNS OpCodes are assigned as follows:\n\

    \      [RFC2136]\n        6-15   Unassigned\n   Although the Status OpCode is\
    \ reserved in [RFC1035], its behavior has\n   not been specified.  New OpCode\
    \ assignments require a Standards\n   Action with early allocation permitted as\
    \ specified in [RFC4020].\n"
- title: 2.3.  RCODE Assignment
  contents:
  - "2.3.  RCODE Assignment\n   It would appear from the DNS header above that only\
    \ four bits of\n   RCODE, or response/error code, are available.  However, RCODEs\
    \ can\n   appear not only at the top level of a DNS response but also inside\n\
    \   TSIG RRs [RFC2845], TKEY RRs [RFC2930], and extended by OPT RRs\n   [RFC6891].\
    \  The OPT RR provides an 8-bit extension to the 4 header\n   bits, resulting\
    \ in a 12-bit RCODE field, and the TSIG and TKEY RRs\n   have a 16-bit field designated\
    \ in their RFCs as the \"Error\" field.\n   Error codes appearing in the DNS header\
    \ and in these other RR types\n   all refer to the same error code space with\
    \ the exception of error\n   code 16, which has a different meaning in the OPT\
    \ RR than in the TSIG\n   RR, and error code 9, whose variations are described\
    \ after the table\n   below.  The duplicate assignment of 16 was accidental. \
    \ To the extent\n   that any prior RFCs imply any sort of different error number\
    \ space\n   for the OPT, TSIG, or TKEY RRs, they are superseded by this unified\n\
    \   DNS error number space.  (This paragraph is the reason this document\n   updates\
    \ [RFC2845] and [RFC2930].)  With the existing exceptions of\n   error numbers\
    \ 9 and 16, the same error number must not be assigned\n   for different errors\
    \ even if they would only occur in different RR\n   types.  See table below.\n\

    \ following\n   criteria:\n   1. The request was documented in a manner that was\
    \ not sufficiently\n      clear or complete to evaluate or implement.  (Additional\n\
    \      documentation can be provided during the Expert Review period.)\n   2.\

    \ makes incorrect assumptions about\n      DNS protocol behavior, such as wildcards,\

  contents:
  - "3.2.  RR CLASS IANA Considerations\n   There are currently two subcategories\
    \ of DNS CLASSes: normal, data-\n   containing classes; and QCLASSes that are\
    \ only meaningful in queries\n   or updates.\n   DNS CLASSes have been little\
    \ used but constitute another dimension of\n   the DNS distributed database. \
    \ In particular, there is no necessary\n   relationship between the namespace\
    \ or root servers for one data CLASS\n   and those for another data CLASS.  The\
    \ same DNS NAME can have\n   completely different meanings in different CLASSes.\
    \  The label types\n   are the same, and the null label is usable only as root\
    \ in every\n   CLASS.  As global networking and DNS have evolved, the IN, or\n\
    \   Internet, CLASS has dominated DNS use.\n   As yet, there has not been a requirement\
    \ for \"Meta-CLASSes\".  That\n   would be a CLASS to designate transient data\
    \ associated with a\n   particular DNS message, which might be usable in queries.\
    \  However,\n   it is possible that there might be a future requirement for one\
    \ or\n   more \"Meta-CLASSes\".\n   Assigned CLASSes have mnemonics that must\
    \ be completely disjoint from\n   the mnemonics used for RRTYPEs and that must\
    \ match the regular\n   expression below.  In addition, the generic CLASS and\
