Abstract This document updates the specification of the component matching rules for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and X.500 directories (RFC3687) by collecting the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) definitions of the component matching rules into an appropriately identified ASN.1 module so that other specifications may reference the component matching rule definitions from within their own ASN.1 modules.
The structure or data type of data held in an attribute of a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
[LDAP] or X.500 [X500] directory is described by the attribute's syntax.
Attribute syntaxes range from simple data types, such as text string, integer, or boolean, to complex data types
, for example, the syntaxes of the directory schema operational attributes.
[CMR] defines a generic way of matching user selected components in a directory attribute value of any arbitrarily complex attribute syntax.
This document updates RFC 3687 by collecting the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [ASN1] definitions of RFC 3687 into an appropriately identified ASN.1 module so that other specifications may reference these definitions from within their own ASN.1 modules.

The object identifiers used in this document have been assigned for use in specifying the component matching rules by Adacel Technologies, under an arc assigned to Adacel by Standards Australia.
This document collects together the ASN.1 definitions of the component matching rules into an ASN.1 module, but does not modify those definitions in any way.
[CMR] for the security considerations of using the component matching rules.
