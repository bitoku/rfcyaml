  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) \"mef\" for\n\
    \   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by\n  \
    \ MEF Forum (https://www.mef.net).  MEF specifies and manages resources\n   that\
    \ utilize this URN identification model.  Management activities\n   for these\
    \ and other resources types are handled by the manager of the\n   MEF Assigned\
    \ Names and Numbers (MANN) registry.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MEF Forum (MEF) is a nonprofit international industry\
    \ standards\n   organization dedicated to the worldwide adoption of Carrier Ethernet\n\
    \   (CE) networks and services.  The forum creates specifications in the\n   areas\
    \ of Services, Architecture, and Operations and Management.\n   As part of these\
    \ specifications efforts, there is a need to identify\n   identifiers in a managed\
    \ namespace that are unique and persistent.\n   To ensure that this namespace's\
    \ uniqueness is absolute, a\n   registration of a specific URN Syntax [RFC2141]\
    \ Namespace Identifier\n   (NID) for use by MEF is being specified in this document.\n"

    \      registration version number: 1\n      registration date: 2016-02-08\n \

    \ Designated contact:\n         Role: Manager, MEF Namespace\n         Email:\
    \ namespace@mef.net\n   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n      The syntax\
    \ of namespace-specific strings for the \"mef\" namespace\n      is <NSS> in RFC\
    \ 2141.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      MEF publishes information\
    \ regarding the registered resources in\n      the MEF Assigned Names and Numbers\
    \ (MANN) registry\n      (https://www.mef.net/MANN).\n   Identifier uniqueness\
    \ considerations:\n      MEF will manage resource classes using the \"mef\" NID\
    \ and will be\n      the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent\n\
    \      strings.  MEF is expected to guarantee the uniqueness of the\n      strings\
    \ themselves, or it may permit secondary responsibility for\n      certain defined\
    \ resources.\n      MEF could allow for use of experimental type values for testing\n\
    \      purposes only.  Note that using experimental types may create\n      collisions\
    \ as multiple users may use the same values for different\n      resources and\
    \ specific strings.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n      MEF will\
    \ update the MEF Assigned Names and Numbers (MANN) registry\n      to document\
    \ the registered resources that will use the \"mef\" NID.\n   Process of identifier\
    \ assignment:\n      Assignment of a URN from the MEF namespace will be documented\
    \ as\n      part of the MEF Assigned Names and Numbers (MANN) registry.\n   Process\
    \ of identifier resolution:\n      The namespace is not listed with a Resolution\
    \ Discovery System\n      (RDS).  Therefore, this process is not relevant.\n \
    \  Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      The entire URN is case-insensitive.\n\
    \   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations\n   Validation\
    \ mechanism:\n      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures\n\
    \      implemented in support of MEF activities.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   There are no security considerations other than\
