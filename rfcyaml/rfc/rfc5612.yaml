- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 1065 [RFC1065] (later superceded by [RFC1155] and [RFC2578])\n\
    \   created a subtree (arc) of object identifiers (OIDs) for identifying\n   management\
    \ objects that are defined unilaterally by a single party,\n   such as an enterprise.\
    \  The subtree for a particular enterprise\n   consists of the prefix \"1.3.6.1.4.1.\"\
    , followed by the Enterprise\n   Number assigned for that enterprise.\n   Enterprise\
    \ Numbers are allocated by IANA, and are also known as\n   \"Private Enterprise\
    \ Numbers\", \"Enterprise Codes\", and \"SMI (Structure\n   of Management Information)\
    \ Network Management Private Enterprise\n   Codes\".  See the \"Private Enterprise\
    \ Number Application Form\"\n   [Application] for more information on how to request\
    \ an Enterprise\n   Number from IANA, and [Numbers] for the list of currently\
    \ assigned\n   numbers.\n   Enterprise Numbers have also been used for many other\
    \ purposes than\n   OIDs in various protocols; for example:\n   o  \"STRUCTURED-DATA\"\
    \ identifiers in Syslog [RFC5424]\n   o  \"Vendor-Specific\" RADIUS attributes\
    \ [RFC2865]\n   o  Mobile IPv4 vendor/organization-specific extensions [RFC3115]\n\
    \   o  User-defined error information in RSVP [RFC5284]\n   o  Vendor options\
    \ in DHCPv4 [RFC3925]\n   o  Enterprise-specific information elements in the IP\
    \ Flow\n      Information Export (IPFIX) protocol [RFC5101]\n   Documents related\
    \ to these protocols may include examples that\n   contain Enterprise Numbers.\
    \  To reduce the likelihood of conflict and\n   confusion, this document specifies\
    \ an Enterprise Number for use in\n   examples in RFCs, books, documentation,\
    \ and the like.\n   This Enterprise Number is not intended to be implemented.\
    \  It is not\n   expected that any implementation would send it, or that any\n\
    \   implementation would treat it specially when receiving it.\n"
- title: 2.  Enterprise Number for Documentation Use
  contents:
  - "2.  Enterprise Number for Documentation Use\n   The Enterprise Number 32473 has\
    \ been allocated for use in examples in\n   RFCs, books, documentation, and the\
    \ like.\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has updated the registration for Enterprise\
    \ Number 32473 to\n   point to this RFC.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Allocating an enterprise number for documentation\
    \ use does not have\n   any direct impact on security.\n"
- title: 5.  Acknowledgments
  contents:
  - "5.  Acknowledgments\n   The need for an Enterprise Number for documentation use\
    \ was\n   identified by Rainer Gerhards for the examples in [RFC5424].  The\n\
    \   authors would also like to thank Michelle Cotton for her help, and\n   Alfred\
    \ Hoenes for his comments.  This document borrows text from\n   [RFC5398] and\
    \ ideas from [RFC4735].\n"
