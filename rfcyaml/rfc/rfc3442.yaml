  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n
    \  (DHCP) option which is passed from the DHCP Server to the DHCP Client\n   to
    configure a list of static routes in the client.  The network\n   destinations
    in these routes are classless - each routing table entry\n   includes a subnet
    mask.\n"

  - "Introduction\n   This option obsoletes the Static Route option (option 33) defined
    in\n   RFC 2132 [4].\n   The IP protocol [1] uses routers to transmit packets
    from hosts\n   connected to one IP subnet to hosts connected to a different IP\n
    \  subnet.  When an IP host (the source host) wishes to transmit a\n   packet
    to another IP host (the destination), it consults its routing\n   table to determine
    the IP address of the router that should be used\n   to forward the packet to
    the destination host.\n   The routing table on an IP host can be maintained in
    a variety of\n   ways - using a routing information protocol such as RIP [8],
    ICMP\n   router discovery [6,9] or using the DHCP Router option, defined in\n
    \  RFC 2132 [4].\n   In a network that already provides DHCP service, using DHCP
    to update\n   the routing table on a DHCP client has several virtues.  It is\n
    \  efficient, since it makes use of messages that would have been sent\n   anyway.
    \ It is convenient - the DHCP server configuration is already\n   being maintained,
    so maintaining routing information, at least on a\n   relatively stable network,
    requires little extra work.  If DHCP\n   service is already in use, no additional
    infrastructure need be\n   deployed.\n   The DHCP protocol as defined in RFC 2131
    [3] and the options defined\n   in RFC 2132 [4] only provide a mechanism for installing
    a default\n   route or installing a table of classful routes.  Classful routes
    are\n   routes whose subnet mask is implicit in the subnet number - see\n   section
    3.2 of STD 5, RFC 791 [1] for details on classful routing.\n   Classful routing
    is no longer in common use, so the DHCP Static Route\n   option is no longer useful.
    \ Currently, classless routing [7, 10] is\n   the most commonly-deployed form
    of routing on the Internet.  In\n   classless routing, IP addresses consist of
    a network number (the\n   combination of the network number and subnet number
    described in RFC\n   950 [7]) and a host number.\n   In classful IP, the network
    number and host number are derived from\n   the IP address using a bitmask whose
    value is determined by the first\n   few bits of the IP address.  In classless
    IP, the network number and\n   host number are derived from the IP address using
    a separate\n   quantity, the subnet mask.  In order to determine the network to\n
    \  which a given route applies, an IP host must know both the network\n   number
    AND the subnet mask for that network.\n   The Static Routes option (option 33)
    does not provide a subnet mask\n   for each route - it is assumed that the subnet
    mask is implicit in\n   whatever network number is specified in each route entry.
    \ The\n   Classless Static Routes option does provide a subnet mask for each\n
    \  entry, so that the subnet mask can be other than what would be\n   determined
    using the algorithm specified in STD 5, RFC 791 [1] and\n   STD 5, RFC 950 [7].\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\" and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [2].\n
    \  This document also uses the following terms:\n      \"DHCP client\"\n         DHCP
    client or \"client\" is an Internet host using DHCP to\n         obtain configuration
    parameters such as a network address.\n      \"DHCP server\"\n         A DHCP
    server or \"server\" is an Internet host that returns\n         configuration
    parameters to DHCP clients.\n      \"link\"\n         Any set of network attachment
    points that will all receive a\n         link-layer broadcast sent on any one
    of the attachment points.\n         This term is used in DHCP because in some
    cases more than one\n         IP subnet may be configured on a link.  DHCP uses
    a local-\n         network (all-ones) broadcast, which is not subnet-specific,
    and\n         will therefore reach all nodes connected to the link,\n         regardless
    of the IP subnet or subnets on which they are\n         configured.\n         A
    \"link\" is sometimes referred to as a broadcast domain or\n         physical
    network segment.\n"

  - "Classless Route Option Format\n   The code for this option is 121, and its minimum
    length is 5 bytes.\n   This option can contain one or more static routes, each
    of which\n   consists of a destination descriptor and the IP address of the router\n
    \  that should be used to reach that destination.\n    Code Len Destination 1

    \  In the above example, two static routes are specified.\n   Destination descriptors
    describe the IP subnet number and subnet mask\n   of a particular destination
    using a compact encoding.  This encoding\n   consists of one octet describing
    the width of the subnet mask,\n   followed by all the significant octets of the
    subnet number.\n   The width of the subnet mask describes the number of one bits
    in the\n   mask, so for example a subnet with a subnet number of 10.0.127.0 and\n
    \  a netmask of 255.255.255.0 would have a subnet mask width of 24.\n   The significant
    portion of the subnet number is simply all of the\n   octets of the subnet number
    where the corresponding octet in the\n   subnet mask is non-zero.  The number
    of significant octets is the\n   width of the subnet mask divided by eight, rounding
    up, as shown in\n   the following table:\n        Width of subnet mask     Number
    of significant octets\n                     0                     0\n                  1-

  - "Local Subnet Routes\n   In some cases more than one IP subnet may be configured
    on a link.\n   In such cases, a host whose IP address is in one IP subnet in the\n
    \  link could communicate directly with a host whose IP address is in a\n   different
    IP subnet on the same link.  In cases where a client is\n   being assigned an
    IP address on an IP subnet on such a link, for each\n   IP subnet in the link
    other than the IP subnet on which the client\n   has been assigned the DHCP server
    MAY be configured to specify a\n   router IP address of 0.0.0.0.\n   For example,
    consider the case where there are three IP subnets\n   configured on a link: 10.0.0/24,
    192.168.0/24, 10.0.21/24.  If the\n   client is assigned an IP address of 10.0.21.17,
    then the server could\n   include a route with a destination of 10.0.0/24 and
    a router address\n   of 0.0.0.0, and also a route with a destination of 192.168.0/24
    and a\n   router address of 0.0.0.0.\n   A DHCP client whose underlying TCP/IP
    stack does not provide this\n   capability MUST ignore routes in the Classless
    Static Routes option\n   whose router IP address is 0.0.0.0.  Please note that
    the behavior\n   described here only applies to the Classless Static Routes option,\n
    \  not to the Static Routes option nor the Router option.\n"

  - "DHCP Client Behavior\n   DHCP clients that do not support this option MUST ignore
    it if it is\n   received from a DHCP server.  DHCP clients that support this option\n
    \  MUST install the routes specified in the option, except as specified\n   in
    the Local Subnet Routes section.  DHCP clients that support this\n   option MUST
    NOT install the routes specified in the Static Routes\n   option (option code
    33) if both a Static Routes option and the\n   Classless Static Routes option
    are provided.\n   DHCP clients that support this option and that send a DHCP Parameter\n
    \  Request List option MUST request both this option and the Router\n   option
    [4] in the DHCP Parameter Request List.\n   DHCP clients that support this option
    and send a parameter request\n   list MAY also request the Static Routes option,
    for compatibility\n   with older servers that don't support Classless Static Routes.
    \ The\n   Classless Static Routes option code MUST appear in the parameter\n   request
    list prior to both the Router option code and the Static\n   Routes option code,
    if present.\n   If the DHCP server returns both a Classless Static Routes option
    and\n   a Router option, the DHCP client MUST ignore the Router option.\n   Similarly,
    if the DHCP server returns both a Classless Static Routes\n   option and a Static
    Routes option, the DHCP client MUST ignore the\n   Static Routes option.\n   After
    deriving a subnet number and subnet mask from each destination\n   descriptor,
    the DHCP client MUST zero any bits in the subnet number\n   where the corresponding
    bit in the mask is zero. In other words, the\n   subnet number installed in the
    routing table is the logical AND of\n   the subnet number and subnet mask given
    in the Classless Static\n   Routes option. For example, if the server sends a
    route with a\n   destination of 129.210.177.132 (hexadecimal 81D4B184) and a subnet\n
    \  mask of 255.255.255.128 (hexadecimal FFFFFF80), the client will\n   install
    a route with a destination of 129.210.177.128 (hexadecimal\n   81D4B180).\n"

  - "Requirements to Avoid Sizing Constraints\n   Because a full routing table can
    be quite large, the standard 576\n   octet maximum size for a DHCP message may
    be too short to contain\n   some legitimate Classless Static Route options.  Because
    of this,\n   clients implementing the Classless Static Route option SHOULD send
    a\n   Maximum DHCP Message Size [4] option if the DHCP client's TCP/IP\n   stack
    is capable of receiving larger IP datagrams.  In this case, the\n   client SHOULD
    set the value of this option to at least the MTU of the\n   interface that the
    client is configuring.  The client MAY set the\n   value of this option higher,
    up to the size of the largest UDP packet\n   it is prepared to accept.  (Note
    that the value specified in the\n   Maximum DHCP Message Size option is the total
    maximum packet size,\n   including IP and UDP headers.)\n   DHCP clients requesting
    this option, and DHCP servers sending this\n   option, MUST implement DHCP option
    concatenation [5].  In the\n   terminology of RFC 3396 [5], the Classless Static
    Route Option is a\n   concatenation-requiring option.\n"

  - "DHCP Server Administrator Responsibilities\n   Many clients may not implement
    the Classless Static Routes option.\n   DHCP server administrators should therefore

    Static Routes\n   option, and should specify the default router(s) both in the
    Router\n   option and in the Classless Static Routes option.\n   When a DHCP client
    requests the Classless Static Routes option and\n   also requests either or both
    of the Router option and the Static\n   Routes option, and the DHCP server is
