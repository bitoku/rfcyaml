- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Voice over IP (VoIP) devices, such as IP phones, have a\
    \ need to\n   download their configuration from a configuration server on the\n\
    \   network.  There are two commonly accepted methods to discover this\n   server\
    \ via DHCP; the \"sname\" field in the DHCP header [RFC2131] and\n   the \"TFTP\
    \ Server Name\" option (66) [RFC2132].  Both of these sources\n   of information,\
    \ however, contain the TFTP server's hostname.  That\n   hostname must then be\
    \ translated to an IP address.  The usual method\n   to accomplish this would\
    \ be DNS [RFC1034].  This means the firmware\n   in a VoIP device (with possibly\
    \ limited flash, memory, and/or\n   processing resources) would need to implement\
    \ the DNS protocol in\n   order to perform this translation.  This would also\
    \ introduce an\n   additional unnecessary point of failure whereby the device\
    \ is\n   dependent on the DNS server infrastructure in order to boot up and\n\
    \   communicate with its call agent.\n   In order to eliminate DNS as a point\
    \ of failure and to keep the\n   firmware in such a VoIP device to a minimum,\
    \ the \"VoIP Configuration\n   Server Address\" option (150) was introduced. \
    \ This option allows the\n   DHCP server to pass one or more IP addresses of the\
    \ VoIP\n   configuration server(s) instead of the hostname, thus making the\n\
    \   information directly usable by the VoIP device.\n   Other reasons for this\
    \ option are (1) the \"siaddr\" field is not\n   configurable on some DHCP servers;\
    \ (2) the \"siaddr\" field only allows\n   for one IPv4 address, and it is desirable\
    \ to have the ability to\n   configure multiple IP addresses for redundancy; (3)\
    \ some DHCP servers\n   have been found to fill in their own IPv4 address as siaddr;\
    \ (4) some\n   customers were already using the \"siaddr\" field for other purposes;\n\
    \   and finally (5) the configuration server may use a protocol other\n   than\
    \ TFTP to serve configuration files, making the use of the \"TFTP\n   Server Name\"\
    \ option (66) inappropriate.\n   In cases where other download server address\
    \ information also appears\n   in the response packet, such as \"sname\" and \"\
    TFTP Server Name\", it is\n   left to the device to decide which piece of information\
    \ to use.\n"

- title: 3.  TFTP Server Address Option Definition
  contents:
  - "3.  TFTP Server Address Option Definition\n   The TFTP Server Address option\
    \ is a DHCP option [RFC2132].  The\n   option contains one or more IPv4 addresses\
    \ that the client MAY use.\n   The current use of this option is for downloading\
    \ configuration from\n   a VoIP server via TFTP; however, the option may be used\
    \ for purposes\n   other than contacting a VoIP configuration server.\n   The\
    \ format of the option is:\n              Code   Len   IPv4 Configuration Server\
    \ Address(es)\n             +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\n          \
    \   | 150 |  n  |     IPv4 address      | ...\n             +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\n\
    \                                 Figure 1\n   The option minimum length (n) is\
    \ 4.\n   The \"Len\" field must specify a length that is an integral multiple\
    \ of\n   4 octets (4, 8, 12, etc.).  If an option is received where this is\n\
    \   not the case, the option information MUST be ignored, but further\n   option\
    \ processing may continue.  Dividing this \"Len\" value by 4 will\n   give the\
    \ number of IPv4 VoIP configuration server addresses that are\n   specified in\
    \ the option.\n   The option MUST NOT be specified by the DHCP client, as it is\n\
    \   intended only to be returned from the DHCP server.  If the DHCP\n   client\
    \ wants to receive this information from the server, it needs to\n   include the\
    \ number 150 in the \"DHCP Parameter List\" option (55).\n   Server addresses\
    \ SHOULD be listed in order of preference, and the\n   client SHOULD use the addresses\
    \ sequentially but may be configured to\n   use addresses randomly.  The client\
    \ may use as many or as few of the\n   addresses provided as it likes.  For example,\
    \ if the client is only\n   capable of accepting two configuration server addresses,\
    \ it may\n   ignore any other addresses provided after the second address.\n \
    \  Each TFTP server address that is being used by the client should be\n   tried\
    \ a total of four times with a 4-second wait time before\n   proceeding to the\
    \ next address.\n   When this option appears along with the TFTP Server Name option\
    \ (66)\n   [RFC2132], this option SHOULD have priority over option 66.\n   There\
    \ is currently no defined IPv6 DHCP equivalent for this option.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   A rogue DHCP server could use this option in\
    \ order to coerce a client\n   into downloading configuration data from an alternate\
    \ configuration\n   server, and thus gain control of the device's configuration.\
    \  This,\n   however, is no more of a security threat than similar attacks using\n\
    \   other DHCP options that specify server names or addresses, of which\n   there\
    \ are many.  If this is a concern, then DHCP authentication may\n   be used, but\
    \ even secure delivery of an address over DHCP does not\n   protect the subsequent\
    \ insecure download over TFTP.  TFTP itself\n   provides no authentication or\
    \ access control mechanisms, so even if\n   DHCP messages were authenticated,\
    \ downloading the configuration would\n   still be insecure, unless some object-level\
    \ security mechanisms were\n   used.\n   Where security concerns are an issue,\
    \ it is suggested that\n   configuration files should be signed by a trusted agent.\n\
    \   Configuration files may also be encrypted based on a configuration\n   parameter\
    \ on the DHCP client device.  In other words, there are\n   various methods to\
    \ ensure the integrity of configuration data\n   independent from ensuring the\
    \ integrity of this DHCP option or even\n   DHCP itself.  The full extent of such\
    \ options is far too broad to be\n   addressed in this document.\n   Message authentication\
    \ in DHCP for intradomain use where the out-of-\n   band exchange of a shared\
    \ secret is feasible is defined in [RFC3118].\n   Potential exposures to attack\
    \ are discussed in Section 7 of the DHCP\n   protocol specification [RFC2131].\n"
