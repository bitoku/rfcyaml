- title: 2. Overview
  contents:
  - "2. Overview\n   When BGP is used to distribute a particular route, it can also\
    \ be\n   used to distribute an MPLS label that is mapped to that route [MPLS-\n\
    \   ARCH].  This document specifies the way in which this is done.  The\n   label\
    \ mapping information for a particular route is piggybacked in\n   the same BGP\
    \ Update message that is used to distribute the route\n   itself.\n   This can\
    \ be useful in the following situations:\n      -  If two immediately adjacent\
    \ Label Switched Routers (LSRs) are\n         also BGP peers, then label distribution\
    \ can be done without the\n         need for any other label distribution protocol.\n\
    \      -  Suppose one's network consists of two \"classes\" of LSR:\n        \
    \ exterior LSRs, which interface to other networks, and interior\n         LSRs,\
    \ which serve only to carry traffic between exterior LSRs.\n         Suppose that\
    \ the exterior LSRs are BGP speakers.  If the BGP\n         speakers distribute\
    \ MPLS labels to each other along with each\n         route they distribute, then\
    \ as long as the interior routers\n         support MPLS, they need not receive\
    \ any of the BGP routes from\n         the BGP speakers.\n         If exterior\
    \ router A needs to send a packet to destination D,\n         and A's BGP next\
    \ hop for D is exterior router B, and B has\n         mapped label L to D, then\
    \ A first pushes L onto the packet's\n         label stack.  A then consults its\
    \ IGP to find the next hop to\n         B, call it C.  If C has distributed to\
    \ A an MPLS label for the\n         route to B, A can push this label on the packet's\
    \ label stack,\n         and then send the packet to C.\n   If a set of BGP speakers\
    \ are exchanging routes via a Route Reflector\n   [BGP-RR], then by piggybacking\
    \ the label distribution on the route\n   distribution, one is able to use the\
    \ Route Reflector to distribute\n   the labels as well.  This improves scalability\
    \ quite significantly.\n   Note that if the Route Reflector is not in the forwarding\
    \ path, it\n   need not even be capable of forwarding MPLS packets.\n   Label\
    \ distribution can be piggybacked in the BGP Update message by\n   using the BGP-4\
    \ Multiprotocol Extensions attribute [RFC 2283].  The\n   label is encoded into\
    \ the NLRI field of the attribute, and the SAFI\n   (\"Subsequent Address Family\
    \ Identifier\") field is used to indicate\n   that the NLRI contains a label.\
    \  A BGP speaker may not use BGP to\n   send labels to a particular BGP peer unless\
    \ that peer indicates,\n   through BGP Capability Advertisement, that it can process\
    \ Update\n   messages with the specified SAFI field.\n"
- title: 3. Carrying Label Mapping Information
  contents:
  - "3. Carrying Label Mapping Information\n   Label mapping information is carried\
    \ as part of the Network Layer\n   Reachability Information (NLRI) in the Multiprotocol\
    \ Extensions\n   attributes.  The AFI indicates, as usual, the address family\
    \ of the\n   associated route.  The fact that the NLRI contains a label is\n \
    \  indicated by using SAFI value 4.\n   The Network Layer Reachability information\
    \ is encoded as one or more\n   triples of the form <length, label, prefix>, whose\
    \ fields are\n   described below:\n      +---------------------------+\n     \
    \ |   Length (1 octet)        |\n      +---------------------------+\n      |\
    \   Label (3 octets)        |\n      +---------------------------+\n      .............................\n\
    \      +---------------------------+\n      |   Prefix (variable)       |\n  \
    \    +---------------------------+\n   The use and the meaning of these fields\
    \ are as follows:\n      a) Length:\n         The Length field indicates the length\
    \ in bits of the address\n         prefix plus the label(s).\n      b) Label:\n\
    \         The Label field carries one or more labels (that corresponds to\n  \
    \       the stack of labels [MPLS-ENCAPS]).  Each label is encoded as 3\n    \
    \     octets, where the high-order 20 bits contain the label value,\n        \
    \ and the low order bit contains \"Bottom of Stack\" (as defined in\n        \
    \ [MPLS-ENCAPS]).\n      c) Prefix:\n         The Prefix field contains address\
    \ prefixes followed by enough\n         trailing bits to make the end of the field\
    \ fall on an octet\n         boundary.  Note that the value of trailing bits is\
    \ irrelevant.\n   The label(s) specified for a particular route (and associated\
    \ with\n   its address prefix) must be assigned by the LSR which is identified\n\
    \   by the value of the Next Hop attribute of the route.\n   When a BGP speaker\
    \ redistributes a route, the label(s) assigned to\n   that route must not be changed\
    \ (except by omission), unless the\n   speaker changes the value of the Next Hop\
    \ attribute of the route.\n   A BGP speaker can withdraw a previously advertised\
    \ route (as well as\n   the binding between this route and a label) by either\
    \ (a) advertising\n   a new route (and a label) with the same NLRI as the previously\n\
    \   advertised route, or (b) listing the NLRI of the previously\n   advertised\
    \ route in the Withdrawn Routes field of an Update message.\n   The label information\
    \ carried (as part of NLRI) in the Withdrawn\n   Routes field should be set to\
    \ 0x800000.  (Of course, terminating the\n   BGP session also withdraws all the\
    \ previously advertised routes.)\n"
- title: 4. Advertising Multiple Routes to a Destination
  contents:
  - "4. Advertising Multiple Routes to a Destination\n   A BGP speaker may maintain\
    \ (and advertise to its peers) more than one\n   route to a given destination,\
    \ as long as each such route has its own\n   label(s).\n   The encoding described\
    \ above allows a single BGP Update message to\n   carry multiple routes, each\
    \ with its own label(s).\n   In the case where a BGP speaker advertises multiple\
    \ routes to a\n   destination, if a route is withdrawn, and a label(s) is specified\
    \ at\n   the time of withdrawal, only the corresponding route with the\n   corresponding\
    \ label is withdrawn.  If a route is withdrawn, and no\n   label is specified\
    \ at the time of withdrawal, then only the\n   corresponding unlabeled route is\
    \ withdrawn; the labeled routes are\n   left in place.\n"
- title: 5. Capability Advertisement
  contents:
  - "5. Capability Advertisement\n   A BGP speaker that uses Multiprotocol Extensions\
    \ to carry label\n   mapping information should use the Capabilities Optional\
    \ Parameter,\n   as defined in [BGP-CAP], to inform its peers about this capability.\n\
    \   The MP_EXT Capability Code, as defined in [BGP-MP], is used to\n   advertise\
    \ the (AFI, SAFI) pairs available on a particular connection.\n   A BGP speaker\
    \ should not advertise this capability to another BGP\n   speaker unless there\
    \ is a Label Switched Path (LSP) between the two\n   speakers.\n   A BGP speaker\
    \ that is capable of handling multiple routes to a\n   destination (as described\
    \ above) should use the Capabilities Optional\n   Parameter, as defined in [BGP-CAP],\
    \ to inform its peers about this\n   capability.  The value of this capability\
    \ is 4.\n"
- title: 6. When the BGP Peers are not Directly Adjacent
  contents:
  - "6. When the BGP Peers are not Directly Adjacent\n   Consider the following LSR\
    \ topology: A--B--C--D.  Suppose that D\n   distributes a label L to A.  In this\
    \ topology, A cannot simply push L\n   onto a packet's label stack, and then send\
    \ the resulting packet to B.\n   D must be the only LSR that sees L at the top\
    \ of the stack.  Before A\n   sends the packet to B, it must push on another label,\
    \ which was\n   distributed by B.  B must replace this label with yet another\
    \ label,\n   which was distributed by C.  In other words, there must be an LSP\n\
    \   between A and D.  If there is no such LSP, A cannot make use of label\n  \
    \ L.  This is true any time labels are distributed between non-adjacent\n   LSRs,\
    \ whether that distribution is done by BGP or by some other\n   method.\n   This\
    \ document does NOT specify any procedure for ensuring in real\n   time that label\
    \ distribution between non-adjacent LSRs is done only\n   when the appropriate\
    \ MPLS infrastructure exists in the network or\n   networks connecting the two\
    \ LSRs.  Ensuring that the proper\n   infrastructure exists is an issue for network\
    \ management and\n   operation.\n"
- title: 7. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   When an LSR A is directly connected to an LSR\
    \ B via a point-to-point\n   interface, then when A receives packets over that\
    \ interface, it knows\n   that they come from B.  This makes it easy for A to\
    \ discard any\n   packets from B whose top labels are not among the labels that\
    \ A\n   distributed to B.  That is, A can easily ensure that B only uses\n   those\
    \ labels which it is entitled to use.  This technique can be used\n   to prevent\
    \ \"label spoofing\", i.e., the situation in which an LSR\n   imposes a label\
    \ which has not been properly distributed to it.\n   The procedures discussed\
    \ in this document would commonly be used when\n   the label distribution peers\
    \ are separated not merely by a point-to-\n   point link, but by an MPLS network.\
    \  This means that when an LSR A\n   processes a labeled packet, it really has\
    \ no way to determine which\n   other LSR B pushed on the top label.  Hence it\
    \ cannot tell whether\n   the label is one which B is entitled to use.  In fact,\
    \ when Route\n   Reflectors are in use, A may not even know the set of LSRs which\n\
    \   receive its label mappings.  So the previous paragraph's technique\n   for\
    \ preventing label spoofing does not apply.\n   It is possible though to use other\
    \ techniques to avoid label spoofing\n   problems.  If, for example, one never\
    \ accepts labeled packets from\n   the network's \"external\" interfaces, and\
    \ all the BGP-distributed\n   labels are advertised via IBGP, then there is no\
    \ way for an untrusted\n   router to put a labeled packet into the network.  One\
    \ can generally\n   assume that one's IBGP peers (or the IBGP peers of one's Route\n\
    \   Reflector) will not attempt label spoofing, since they are all under\n   the\
    \ control of a single administration.\n   This condition can actually be weakened\
    \ significantly.  One doesn't\n   need to refuse to accept all labeled packets\
    \ from external\n   interfaces.  One just needs to make sure that any labeled\
    \ packet\n   received on an external interface has a top label which was actually\n\
    \   distributed out that interface.\n   Then a label spoofing problem would only\
    \ exist if there are both\n   trusted and untrusted systems out the same interface.\
    \  One way to\n   avoid this problem is simply to avoid this situation.\n"
