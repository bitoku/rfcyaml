- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP), Version 1.0, is\
    \ specified\n   in [RFC 2801, 2802, 2803].  It provides a payment system independent\n\
    \   framework for Internet commerce oriented to consumer to business\n   transactions.\
    \  It provides mechanism for different portions of the\n   business function,\
    \ such as fulfillment or payment handling, to be\n   distributed or outsourced.\
    \  It does not require a prior relationship\n   between the consumer and business.\n\
    \   Several errors have been noted in the IOTP v1.0 specification,\n   particularly\
    \ RFC 2801, which was the largest RFC ever issued.  These\n   are listed, with\
    \ their fix, in this document.\n"
