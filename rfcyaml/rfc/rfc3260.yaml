  - "1.  Introduction\n   As the Diffserv work has evolved, there have been several\
    \ cases where\n   terminology has needed to be created or the definitions in Diffserv\n\
    \   standards track RFCs have needed to be refined.  Some minor technical\n  \
    \ clarifications were also found to be needed.  This memo was created\n   to capture\
    \ group agreements, rather than attempting to revise the\n   base RFCs and recycle\
    \ them at proposed standard.  It updates in part\n   RFC 2474, RFC 2475 and RFC\
    \ 2597.  RFC 2598 has been obsoleted by RFC\n   3246, and clarifications agreed\
    \ by the group were incorporated in\n   that revision.\n"
- title: 2. Terminology Related to Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
  contents:
  - "2. Terminology Related to Service Level Agreements (SLAs)\n   The Diffserv Architecture\
    \ [2] uses the term \"Service Level Agreement\"\n   (SLA) to describe the \"service\
    \ contract... that specifies the\n   forwarding service a customer should receive\"\
    .  The SLA may include\n   traffic conditioning rules which (at least in part)\
    \ constitute a\n   Traffic Conditioning Agreement (TCA).  A TCA is \"an agreement\n\
    \   specifying classifier rules and any corresponding traffic profiles\n   and\
    \ metering, marking, discarding and/or shaping rules which are to\n   apply....\"\
    \n   As work progressed in Diffserv (as well as in the Policy WG [6]), it\n  \
    \ came to be believed that the notion of an \"agreement\" implied\n   considerations\
    \ that were of a pricing, contractual or other business\n   nature, as well as\
    \ those that were strictly technical.  There also\n   could be other technical\
    \ considerations in such an agreement (e.g.,\n   service availability) which are\
    \ not addressed by Diffserv.  It was\n   therefore agreed that the notions of\
    \ SLAs and TCAs would be taken to\n   represent the broader context, and that\
    \ new terminology would be used\n   to describe those elements of service and\
    \ traffic conditioning that\n   are addressed by Diffserv.\n      -  A Service\
    \ Level Specification (SLS) is a set of parameters and\n         their values\
    \ which together define the service offered to a\n         traffic stream by a\
    \ DS domain.\n      -  A Traffic Conditioning Specification (TCS) is a set of\n\
    \         parameters and their values which together specify a set of\n      \
    \   classifier rules and a traffic profile.  A TCS is an integral\n         element\
    \ of an SLS.\n   Note that the definition of \"Traffic stream\" is unchanged from\
    \ RFC\n   2475.  A traffic stream can be an individual microflow or a group of\n\
    \   microflows (i.e., in a source or destination DS domain) or it can be\n   a\
    \ BA.  Thus, an SLS may apply in the source or destination DS domain\n   to a\
    \ single microflow or group of microflows, as well as to a BA in\n   any DS domain.\n\
    \   Also note that the definition of a \"Service Provisioning Policy\" is\n  \
    \ unchanged from RFC 2475.  RFC 2475 defines a \"Service Provisioning\n   Policy\
    \ as \"a policy which defines how traffic conditioners are\n   configured on DS\
    \ boundary nodes and how traffic streams are mapped to\n   DS behavior aggregates\
    \ to achieve a range of services.\"  According to\n   one definition given in\
    \ RFC 3198 [6], a policy is \"...a set of rules\n   to administer, manage, and\
    \ control access to network resources\".\n   Therefore, the relationship between\
    \ an SLS and a service provisioning\n   policy is that the latter is, in part,\
    \ the set of rules that express\n   the parameters and range of values that may\
    \ be in the former.\n   Further note that this definition is more restrictive\
    \ than that in\n   RFC 3198.\n"
- title: 3. Usage of PHB Group
  contents:
  - "3. Usage of PHB Group\n   RFC 2475 defines a Per-hop behavior (PHB) group to\
    \ be:\n      \"a set of one or more PHBs that can only be meaningfully specified\n\
    \      and implemented simultaneously, due to a common constraint\n      applying\
    \ to all PHBs in the set such as a queue servicing or queue\n      management\
    \ policy.  A PHB group provides a service building block\n      that allows a\
    \ set of related forwarding behaviors to be specified\n      together (e.g., four\
    \ dropping priorities).  A single PHB is a\n      special case of a PHB group.\"\
    \n   One standards track PHB Group is defined in RFC 2597 [3], \"Assured\n   Forwarding\
    \ PHB Group\".  Assured Forwarding (AF) is a type of\n   forwarding behavior with\
    \ some assigned level of queuing resources and\n   three drop precedences.  An\
    \ AF PHB Group consists of three PHBs, and\n   uses three Diffserv Codepoints\
    \ (DSCPs).\n   RFC 2597 defines twelve DSCPs, corresponding to four independent\
    \ AF\n   classes.  The AF classes are referred to as AF1x, AF2x, AF3x, and\n \
    \  AF4x (where 'x' is 1, 2, or 3 to represent drop precedence).  Each AF\n   class\
    \ is one instance of an AF PHB Group.\n   There has been confusion expressed that\
    \ RFC 2597 refers to all four\n   AF classes with their three drop precedences\
    \ as being part of a\n   single PHB Group.  However, since each AF class operates\
    \ entirely\n   independently of the others, (and thus there is no common constraint\n\
    \   among AF classes as there is among drop precedences within an AF\n   class)\
    \ this usage is inconsistent with RFC 2475.  The inconsistency\n   exists for\
    \ historical reasons and will be removed in future revisions\n   of the AF specification.\
    \  It should now be understood that AF is a\n   _type_ of PHB group, and each\
    \ AF class is an _instance_ of the AF\n   type.\n   Authors of new PHB specifications\
    \ should be careful to adhere to the\n   RFC 2475 definition of PHB Group.  RFC\
    \ 2475 does not prohibit new PHB\n   specifications from assigning enough DSCPs\
    \ to represent multiple\n   independent instances of their PHB Group.  However,\
    \ such a set of\n   DSCPs must not be referred to as a single PHB Group.\n"
- title: 4. Definition of the DS Field
  contents:
  - "4. Definition of the DS Field\n   Diffserv uses six bits of the IPV4 or IPV6\
    \ header to convey the\n   Diffserv Codepoint (DSCP), which selects a PHB.  RFC\
    \ 2474 attempts to\n   rename the TOS octet of the IPV4 header, and Traffic Class\
    \ octet of\n   the IPV6 header, respectively, to the DS field.  The DS Field has\
    \ a\n   six bit Diffserv Codepoint and two \"currently unused\" bits.\n   It has\
    \ been pointed out that this leads to inconsistencies and\n   ambiguities.  In\
    \ particular, the \"Currently Unused\" (CU) bits of the\n   DS Field have not\
    \ been assigned to Diffserv, and subsequent to the\n   publication of RFC 2474,\
    \ they were assigned for explicit congestion\n   notification, as defined in RFC\
    \ 3168 [4].  In the current text, a\n   DSCP is, depending on context, either\
    \ an encoding which selects a PHB\n   or a sub-field in the DS field which contains\
    \ that encoding.\n   The present text is also inconsistent with BCP 37, IANA Allocation\n\
    \   Guidelines for Values in the Internet Protocol and Related Headers\n   [5].\
    \  The IPV4 Type-of-Service (TOS) field and the IPV6 traffic class\n   field are\
    \ superseded by the 6 bit DS field and a 2 bit CU field.  The\n   IANA allocates\
    \ values in the DS field following the IANA\n   considerations section in RFC\
    \ 2474, as clarified in section 8 of this\n   memo.\n   The consensus of the DiffServ\
    \ working group is that BCP 37 correctly\n   restates the structure of the former\
    \ TOS and traffic class fields.\n   Therefore, for use in future documents, including\
    \ the next update to\n   RFC 2474, the following definitions should apply:\n \
    \     -  the Differentiated Services Field (DSField) is the six most\n       \
    \  significant bits of the (former) IPV4 TOS octet or the (former)\n         IPV6\
    \ Traffic Class octet.\n      -  the Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP)\
    \ is a value which\n         is encoded in the DS field, and which each DS Node\
    \ MUST use to\n         select the PHB which is to be experienced by each packet\
    \ it\n         forwards.\n   The two least significant bits of the IPV4 TOS octet\
    \ and the IPV6\n   Traffic Class octet are not used by Diffserv.\n   When RFC\
    \ 2474 is updated, consideration should be given to changing\n   the designation\
    \ \"currently unused (CU)\" to \"explicit congestion\n   notification (ECN)\"\
    \ and referencing RFC 3168 (or its successor).\n   The update should also reference\
    \ BCP 37.\n"
- title: 5. Ordered Aggregates and PHB Scheduling Classes
  contents:
  - "5. Ordered Aggregates and PHB Scheduling Classes\n   Work on Diffserv support\
    \ by MPLS Label Switched Routers (LSRs) led to\n   the realization that a concept\
    \ was needed in Diffserv to capture the\n   notion of a set of BAs with a common\
    \ ordering constraint.  This\n   presently applies to AF behavior aggregates,\
    \ since a DS node may not\n   reorder packets of the same microflow if they belong\
    \ to the same AF\n   class.  This would, for example, prevent an MPLS LSR, which\
    \ was also\n   a DS node, from discriminating between packets of an AF Behavior\n\
    \   Aggregate (BA) based on drop precedence and forwarding packets of the\n  \
    \ same AF class but different drop precedence over different LSPs.  The\n   following\
    \ new terms are defined.\n      PHB Scheduling Class: A PHB group for which a\
    \ common constraint is\n      that, ordering of at least those packets belonging\
    \ to the same\n      microflow must be preserved.\n      Ordered Aggregate (OA):\
    \ A set of Behavior Aggregates that share an\n      ordering constraint.  The\
    \ set of PHBs that are applied to this set\n      of Behavior Aggregates constitutes\
    \ a PHB scheduling class.\n"
- title: 6. Unknown/Improperly Mapped DSCPs
  contents:
  - "6. Unknown/Improperly Mapped DSCPs\n   Several implementors have pointed out\
    \ ambiguities or conflicts in the\n   Diffserv RFCs concerning behavior when a\
    \ DS-node receives a packet\n   with a DSCP which it does not understand.\n  \
    \ RFC 2475 states:\n      \"Ingress nodes must condition all other inbound traffic\
    \ to ensure\n      that the DS codepoints are acceptable; packets found to have\n\
    \      unacceptable codepoints must either be discarded or must have\n      their\
    \ DS codepoints modified to acceptable values before being\n      forwarded. \
    \ For example, an ingress node receiving traffic from a\n      domain with which\
    \ no enhanced service agreement exists may reset\n      the DS codepoint to the\
    \ Default PHB codepoint [DSFIELD].\"\n   On the other hand, RFC 2474 states:\n\
    \      \"Packets received with an unrecognized codepoint SHOULD be\n      forwarded\
    \ as if they were marked for the Default behavior (see\n      Sec. 4), and their\
    \ codepoints should not be changed.\"\n   RFC 2474 is principally concerned with\
    \ DS-interior nodes.  However,\n   this behavior could also be performed in DS-ingress\
    \ nodes AFTER the\n   traffic conditioning required by RFC 2475 (in which case,\
    \ an\n   unrecognized DSCP would occur only in the case of misconfiguration).\n\
    \   If a packet arrives with a DSCP that hadn't been explicitly mapped to\n  \
    \ a particular PHB, it should be treated the same way as a packet\n   marked for\
    \ Default.  The alternatives were to assign it another PHB,\n   which could result\
    \ in misallocation of provisioned resources, or to\n   drop it.  Those are the\
    \ only alternatives within the framework of RFC\n   2474.  Neither alternative\
    \ was considered desirable.  There has been\n   discussion of a PHB which receives\
    \ worse service than the default;\n   this might be a better alternative.  Hence\
    \ the imperative was\n   \"SHOULD\" rather than \"SHALL\".\n   The intent of RFC\
    \ 2475 clearly concerns DS-ingress nodes, or more\n   precisely, the ingress traffic\
    \ conditioning function.  This is\n   another context where the \"SHOULD\" in\
    \ RFC 2474 provides the\n   flexibility to do what the group intended.  Such tortured\
    \ readings\n   are not desirable.\n   Therefore, the statement in RFC 2474 will\
    \ be clarified to indicate\n   that it is not intended to apply at the ingress\
    \ traffic conditioning\n   function at a DS-ingress node, and cross reference\
    \ RFC 2475 for that\n   case.\n   There was a similar issue, which manifested\
    \ itself with the first\n   incarnation of Expedited Forwarding (EF).  RFC 2598\
    \ states:\n      To protect itself against denial of service attacks, the edge\
    \ of a\n      DS domain MUST strictly police all EF marked packets to a rate\n\
    \      negotiated with the adjacent upstream domain.  (This rate must be\n   \
    \   <= the EF PHB configured rate.)  Packets in excess of the\n      negotiated\
    \ rate MUST be dropped.  If two adjacent domains have not\n      negotiated an\
    \ EF rate, the downstream domain MUST use 0 as the\n      rate (i.e., drop all\
    \ EF marked packets).\n   The problem arose in the case of misconfiguration or\
    \ routing\n   problems.  An egress DS-node at the edge of one DS-domain forwards\n\
    \   packets to an ingress DS-node at the edge of another DS domain.\n   These\
    \ packets are marked with a DSCP that the egress node understands\n   to map to\
    \ EF, but which the ingress node does not recognize.  The\n   statement in RFC\
    \ 2475 would appear to apply to this case.  RFC 3246\n   [7] clarifies this point.\n"
- title: 7. No Backward Compatibility With RFC 1349
  contents:
  - "7. No Backward Compatibility With RFC 1349\n   At least one implementor has expressed\
    \ confusion about the\n   relationship of the DSField, as defined in RFC 2474,\
    \ to the use of\n   the TOS bits, as described in RFC 1349.  The RFC 1349 usage\
    \ was\n   intended to interact with OSPF extensions in RFC 1247.  These were\n\
    \   never widely deployed and thus removed by standards action when STD\n   54,\
    \ RFC 2328, was published.  The processing of the TOS bits is\n   described as\
    \ a requirement in RFC 1812 [8], RFC 1122 [9] and RFC 1123\n   [10].  RFC 2474\
    \ states:\n      \"No attempt is made to maintain backwards compatibility with\
    \ the\n      \"DTR\" or TOS bits of the IPv4 TOS octet, as defined in [RFC791].\"\
    ,\n   In addition, RFC 2474 obsoletes RFC 1349 by IESG action.  For\n   completeness,\
    \ when RFC 2474 is updated, the sentence should read:\n      \"No attempt is made\
    \ to maintain backwards compatibility with the\n      \"DTR/MBZ\" or TOS bits\
    \ of the IPv4 TOS octet, as defined in\n      [RFC791] and [RFC1349].  This implies\
    \ that TOS bit processing as\n      described in [RFC1812], [RFC1122] and [RFC1123]\
    \ is also obsoleted\n      by this memo.  Also see [RFC2780].\"\n"
