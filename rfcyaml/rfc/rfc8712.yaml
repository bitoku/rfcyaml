- title: 1.  Introduction and History
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and History\n   The Internet Society provides a corporate home\
    \ for the administrative\n   entity that supports the Internet Engineering Task\
    \ Force (IETF), the\n   Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet Research\
    \ Task\n   Force (IRTF), and supports the work of these groups through a variety\n\
    \   of programs.\n   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is the body that\
    \ is\n   responsible for the development and maintenance of the Internet\n   Standards.\
    \  The IETF is primarily a volunteer organization.  Its\n   driving force is a\
    \ group of dedicated, high-quality engineers from\n   all over the world.  In\
    \ a structure of working groups, these\n   engineers exchange ideas and experience,\
    \ and through discussion and\n   collaboration (both electronically and face-to-face),\
    \ they strive to\n   achieve rough consensus and implement the standards through\
    \ running\n   code.\n   The growth of the Internet over several decades has also\
    \ led to the\n   growth of the IETF.  More and more people, organizations, and\n\
    \   companies rely on Internet Standards.  Nontechnical issues, such as\n   legal,\
    \ administrative, and financial issues had long been an\n   undesirable but unavoidable\
    \ part of the IETF.  To address these\n   issues, the IETF established the Poised95\
    \ Working Group in 1995.  Its\n   goal was to structure and document the IETF\
    \ processes in order to\n   maximize the flexibility and freedom of IETF engineers\
    \ so that they\n   could work in the way the IETF had always been most successful\
    \ and to\n   honor the IETF credo: \"Rough consensus and running code\".\n   The\
    \ Poised95 Working Group concluded that the Internet Society\n   (ISOC), which\
    \ was formed in 1992, was the best organization to handle\n   all of these legal,\
    \ administrative, and financial tasks on behalf of,\n   and in close cooperation\
    \ with, the IETF.  This led to documenting\n   things such as the IETF standards\
    \ process [RFC2026], the IETF\n   organizational structure [RFC2028], the IETF\
    \ Nominating Committee\n   (NomCom) procedures [RFC2027], and the IETF-ISOC relationship\n\
    \   [RFC2031].\n   As time passed and operational experience accumulated, additional\n\
    \   structure was necessary.  As a result, the Internet Administrative\n   Support\
    \ Activity (IASA) was defined in 2005 and documented in\n   [RFC4071] and [RFC4371].\n\
    \   In 2018, the IASA was revised under a new \"IASA 2.0\" structure by the\n\
    \   IASA2 Working Group, which made significant revisions to the IETF's\n   administrative,\
    \ legal, and financial structure.  One critical outcome\n   was the formation,\
    \ in close cooperation between the IETF and ISOC, of\n   the IETF Administration\
    \ Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC) as a\n   subsidiary of ISOC.\n   As a result\
    \ of the IASA 2.0 structure [RFC8711] and formation of the\n   IETF LLC, the relationship\
    \ between the IETF and ISOC has changed.\n   This document summarizes the current\
    \ state of the IETF-ISOC\n   relationship at a high level and replaces [RFC2031].\n"
- title: 2.  Philosophical Relationship with ISOC
  contents:
  - "2.  Philosophical Relationship with ISOC\n   ISOC and the IETF have historically\
    \ been philosophically aligned.\n   ISOC's connection with the IETF community\
    \ has always played an\n   important role in its policy work, which has not changed.\
    \  ISOC has\n   always been and continues to be an advocate for multistakeholder\n\
    \   processes, which includes the technical community.  Open standards\n   are\
    \ an explicit part of one of the focus areas in ISOC's mission:\n   advancing\
    \ the development and application of Internet infrastructure,\n   technologies,\
    \ and open standards [ISOC-Mission].\n"
- title: 3.  Main Division of Responsibilities between IETF and ISOC
  contents:
  - "3.  Main Division of Responsibilities between IETF and ISOC\n   The IETF remains\
    \ responsible for the development and quality of the\n   Internet Standards. \
    \ Apart from the roles described below, the IETF\n   and ISOC acknowledge that\
    \ ISOC as an organization has no direct\n   influence whatsoever on the technical\
    \ content of Internet Standards\n   (though ISOC employees may independently continue\
    \ to make technical\n   contributions as individuals).\n"
- title: 4.  ISOC's Role in the IETF Standards Process
  contents:
  - "4.  ISOC's Role in the IETF Standards Process\n   ISOC plays a small role in\
    \ the IETF standards process.  In\n   particular, ISOC assists the standards process\
    \ by appointing the IETF\n   NomCom chair and by confirming IAB candidates who\
    \ are put forward by\n   the IETF NomCom, as described in [RFC8713], and by acting\
    \ as the last\n   resort in the appeals process, as described in [RFC2026].\n\
    \   ISOC maintains liaison relationships and memberships in other\n   Standards\
    \ Development Organizations (SDOs) and related organizations,\n   which directly\
    \ benefits the IETF.  For example, ISOC is a Sector\n   Member of the ITU-T. \
    \ As a result, ISOC delegates are afforded the\n   same rights as other ITU-T\
    \ Sector Members [RFC6756].\n   ISOC also supports the IETF standards process\
    \ indirectly (e.g., by\n   promoting it in relevant communities) through several\
    \ programs.  For\n   example, ISOC's Policymakers Programme to the IETF (usually\
    \ referred\n   to simply as ISOC's IETF Policy Program) gives policy experts an\n\
    \   opportunity to interact directly with the IETF technical community.\n   ISOC\
    \ also performs technical work using the standards developed in\n   the IETF as\
    \ its basis.  An example of that is ISOC's work in\n   encouraging and supporting\
    \ the deployment of IETF standards.\n   Otherwise, the involvement of ISOC's employees\
    \ in the IETF standards\n   process (e.g., as document editors or in leadership\
    \ positions) is as\n   individual contributors rather than on institutional grounds.\n"
- title: 5.  The IETF's Role in ISOC
  contents:
  - "5.  The IETF's Role in ISOC\n   The IETF plays a role in the governance of ISOC.\
    \  Per ISOC's bylaws,\n   the IETF appoints a set of trustees to the ISOC Board.\
    \  The process\n   by which the IETF makes those appointments is defined in [RFC3677].\n\
    \   The charter of the IAB (Internet Architecture Board) [RFC2850] states\n  \
    \ that \"the IAB acts as a source of advice and guidance to the Board of\n   Trustees\
    \ and Officers of the Internet Society concerning technical,\n   architectural,\
    \ procedural, and (where appropriate) policy matters\n   pertaining to the Internet\
    \ and its enabling technologies\".  This\n   connection between the IAB and ISOC\
    \ ensures that ISOC's proposals in\n   the policy area are based on a sound understanding\
    \ of the relevant\n   technologies and architectures.  ISOC's strong connection\
    \ to the\n   Internet technical community has always been one of its main\n  \
    \ strengths.\n"
- title: 6.  Legal Relationship with ISOC
  contents:
  - "6.  Legal Relationship with ISOC\n   The IETF LLC is a disregarded Limited Liability\
    \ Company (LLC) of the\n   Internet Society that was established to provide a\
    \ corporate legal\n   framework for facilitating current and future activities\
    \ related to\n   the IETF, IAB, and IRTF.  It was established by the ISOC / IETF\
    \ LLC\n   Agreement [OpAgreement] on August 27, 2018, and governs the\n   relationship\
    \ between the IETF LLC and ISOC.\n   The IETF Trust, documented in [RFC5378],\
    \ and updated in [RFC8714] and\n   [RFC8715], provides legal protection for the\
    \ RFC Series of documents\n   and other aspects of the IETF.  This includes things\
    \ such as\n   protection for trademarks, copyrights, and intellectual property\n\
    \   rights.  As part of the IETF Trust arrangement, IETF standards\n   documents\
    \ can be freely downloaded, copied, and distributed without\n   financial or other\
    \ distribution restrictions, though all rights to\n   change these documents lie\
    \ with the IETF.  The IETF Trust also\n   provides legal protection in case of\
    \ disputes over intellectual\n   property rights and other rights.  The creation\
    \ of the IETF LLC has\n   changed the way that the IETF Trust's trustees are selected\
    \ but did\n   not change the purpose or operation of the Trust.  One of the IETF\n\
    \   Trust's trustees is appointed by the ISOC's Board of Trustees.\n"
- title: 7.  Financial and Administrative Relationship with ISOC
  contents:
  - "7.  Financial and Administrative Relationship with ISOC\n   Under the terms of\
    \ the Operating Agreement [OpAgreement] between ISOC\n   and the IETF, ISOC has\
    \ agreed to provide significant funding support\n   for the IETF.  In addition,\
    \ the IETF LLC is responsible for creating\n   and managing an annual operating\
    \ budget for the IETF; for\n   negotiating, signing, and overseeing contracts;\
    \ for fundraising; for\n   maintaining bank accounts; and for liability insurance.\
    \  The IETF LLC\n   is managed by a Board of Directors, one of whom is appointed\
    \ by the\n   ISOC's Board of Trustees.  The intention is that ISOC and the IETF\n\
    \   LLC operate at arm's length.\n   The IETF LLC establishes contracts with third\
    \ parties to provide\n   different types of services to the IETF.  Note that it\
    \ is possible\n   that some of those services may be provided by ISOC or involve\
    \ ISOC\n   staff.\n   Under the new IASA 2.0 structure, the IETF LLC is solely\
    \ responsible\n   for its administration, including the IETF Trust, IAB, IESG,\
    \ IETF\n   working groups, and other IETF processes.  A further exploration of\n\
    \   this can be found in Section 4 of [RFC8711].\n"
