    server functions.  These extensions represent a\n   portion of the Management
    Information Base (MIB) for use with network\n   management protocols in the Internet
    community.  Using these\n   extensions, IP-based management stations can manage
    RADIUS\n   authentication servers.\n   This memo obsoletes RFC 2619 by deprecating
    the MIB table containing\n   IPv4-only address formats and defining a new table
    to add support for\n   version-neutral IP address formats.  The remaining MIB
    objects from\n   RFC 2619 are carried forward into this document.  This memo also
    adds\n   UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n
    \  This document uses terminology from RFC 2865 [RFC2865].\n   This document uses
    the word \"malformed\" with respect to RADIUS\n   packets, particularly in the
    context of counters of \"malformed\n   packets\".  While RFC 2865 does not provide
    an explicit definition of\n   \"malformed\", malformed generally means that the
    implementation has\n   determined the packet does not match the format defined
    in RFC 2865.\n   Some implementations may determine that packets are malformed
    when\n   the Vendor Specific Attribute (VSA) format does not follow the RFC\n
    \  2865 recommendations for VSAs.  Those implementations are used in\n   deployments
    today, and thus set the de facto definition of\n   \"malformed\".\n"

  - "3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of
    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "4.  Scope of Changes\n   This document obsoletes RFC 2619 [RFC2619], RADIUS Authentication\n
    \  Server MIB, by deprecating the radiusAuthClientTable table and adding\n   a
    new table, radiusAuthClientExtTable, containing\n   radiusAuthClientInetAddressType
    and radiusAuthClientInetAddress.  The\n   purpose of these added MIB objects is
    to support version-neutral IP\n   addressing formats.  The existing table containing\n
    \  radiusAuthClientAddress is deprecated.  The remaining MIB objects\n   from
    RFC 2619 are carried forward into this document.  This memo also\n   adds UNITS
    and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.\n   RFC 4001 [RFC4001], which defines
    the SMI Textual Conventions for\n   version-neutral IP addresses, contains the
    following recommendation.\n   'In particular, when revising a MIB module that
    contains IPv4\n   specific tables, it is suggested to define new tables using
    the\n   textual conventions defined in this memo [RFC4001] that support all\n
    \  versions of IP.  The status of the new tables SHOULD be \"current\",\n   whereas
    the status of the old IP version specific tables SHOULD be\n   changed to \"deprecated\".
    \ The other approach, of having multiple\n   similar tables for different IP versions,
    is strongly discouraged.'\n"
  title: 4.  Scope of Changes
- contents:
  - "5.  Structure of the MIB Module\n   The RADIUS authentication protocol, described
    in RFC 2865 [RFC2865],\n   distinguishes between the client function and the server
    function.\n   In RADIUS authentication, clients send Access-Requests, and servers\n
    \  reply with Access-Accepts, Access-Rejects, and Access-Challenges.\n   Typically,
    NAS devices implement the client function, and thus would\n   be expected to implement
    the RADIUS authentication client MIB, while\n   RADIUS authentication servers
    implement the server function, and thus\n   would be expected to implement the
    RADIUS authentication server MIB.\n   However, it is possible for a RADIUS authentication
    entity to perform\n   both client and server functions.  For example, a RADIUS
    proxy may\n   act as a server to one or more RADIUS authentication clients, while\n
    \  simultaneously acting as an authentication client to one or more\n   authentication
    servers.  In such situations, it is expected that\n   RADIUS entities combining
    client and server functionality will\n   support both the client and server MIBs.
    \ The server MIB is defined\n   in this document, and the client MIB is defined
    in [RFC4668].\n   This MIB module contains fourteen scalars as well as a single
    table,\n   the RADIUS Authentication Client Table, which contains one row for\n
    \  each RADIUS authentication client with which the server shares a\n   secret.
    \ Each entry in the RADIUS Authentication Client Table\n   includes thirteen columns
    presenting a view of the activity of the\n   RADIUS authentication server.\n   This
    MIB imports from [RFC2578], [RFC2580], [RFC3411], and [RFC4001].\n"

  - "6.  Deprecated Objects\n   The deprecated table in this MIB is carried forward
    from RFC 2619\n   [RFC2619].  There are two conditions under which it MAY be desirable\n
    \  for managed entities to continue to support the deprecated table:\n   1.  The
    managed entity only supports IPv4 address formats.\n   2.  The managed entity
    supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address formats,\n       and the deprecated table
    is supported for backwards compatibility\n       with older management stations.
    \ This option SHOULD only be used\n       when the IP addresses in the new table
    are in IPv4 format and can\n       accurately be represented in both the new table
    and the\n       deprecated table.\n   Managed entities SHOULD NOT instantiate
    row entries in the deprecated\n   table, containing IPv4-only address objects,
    when the RADIUS client\n   address represented in such a table row is not an IPv4
    address.\n   Managed entities SHOULD NOT return inaccurate values of IP address
    or\n   SNMP object access errors for IPv4-only address objects in otherwise\n
    \  populated tables.  When row entries exist in both the deprecated\n   IPv4-only
    table and the new IP-version-neutral table that describe\n   the same RADIUS client,
    the row indexes SHOULD be the same for the\n   corresponding rows in each table,
    to facilitate correlation of these\n   related rows by management applications.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ These are:\n   radiusAuthServConfigReset\n      This object can be used to reinitialize
    the persistent state of\n      any server.  When set to reset(2), any persistent
    server state\n      (such as a process) is reinitialized as if the server had
    just\n      been started.  Depending on the server implementation details,\n      this
    action may or may not interrupt the processing of pending\n      request in the
    server.  Abuse of this object may lead to a Denial\n      of Service attack on
    the server.\n   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain\n
    \  sensitive information.  These are:\n   radiusAuthClientIPAddress\n      This
    can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS\n      authentication client
    with which the server is communicating.\n      This information could be useful
    in mounting an attack on the\n      authentication client.\n   radiusAuthClientInetAddress\n
    \     This can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS\n      authentication
    client with which the server is communicating.\n      This information could be
    useful in mounting an attack on the\n      authentication client.\n   It is thus
    important to control even GET access to these objects and\n   possibly to even
    encrypt the values of these object when sending them\n   over the network via
    SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features\n   for such a secure environment.\n
    \  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 do not provide a secure environment.\n   Even
    if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   there is no
    control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
    the objects in this\n   MIB.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider
    the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410],
    section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
    (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions
    prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy
    SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
    \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
    of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only
    to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET
    (change/create/delete) them.\n"
