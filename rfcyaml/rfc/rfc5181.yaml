    \ users\n   will be connected to IPv6 networks.  While the IEEE 802.16 standard\n\
    \   defines the encapsulation of an IPv4/IPv6 datagram in an IEEE 802.16\n   Media\
    \ Access Control (MAC) payload, a complete description of IPv4/\n   IPv6 operation\
    \ and deployment is not present.  The IEEE 802.16\n   standards are limited to\
    \ L1 and L2, so they may be used within any\n   number of IP network architectures\
    \ and scenarios.  In this document,\n   we will discuss the main components of\
    \ IPv6 IEEE 802.16 access\n   networks and their differences from IPv4 IEEE 802.16\

  - "2.2.  Scenarios and IPv6 Deployment\n   [IEEE802.16] specifies two modes for\
    \ sharing the wireless medium:\n   point-to-multipoint (PMP) and mesh (optional).\
    \  This document only\n   focuses on the PMP mode.\n   Some of the factors that\
    \ hinder deployment of native IPv6 core\n   protocols are already introduced by\
    \ [RFC5154].\n   There are two different deployment scenarios: fixed and mobile\
    \ access\n   deployment scenarios.  A fixed access scenario substitutes for\n\
    \   existing wired-based access technologies such as digital subscriber\n   lines\
    \ (xDSL) and cable networks.  This fixed access scenario can\n   provide nomadic\
    \ access within the radio coverages, which is called\n   the Hot-zone model. \
    \ A mobile access scenario exists for the new\n   paradigm of transmitting voice,\
    \ data, and video over mobile networks.\n   This scenario can provide high-speed\
    \ data rates equivalent to the\n   wire-based Internet as well as mobility functions\
    \ equivalent to\n   cellular systems.  There are the different IPv6 impacts on\n\
    \   convergence sublayer type, link model, addressing, mobility, etc.\n   between\
    \ fixed and mobile access deployment scenarios.  The details\n   will be discussed\
    \ below.  The mobile access scenario can be\n   classified into two different\

  - "2.2.1.1.  IPv6-Related Infrastructure Changes\n   IPv6 will be deployed in this\
    \ scenario by upgrading the following\n   devices to dual stack: MS, AR, and ER.\
    \  In this scenario, IEEE 802.16\n   BSs have only MAC and PHY (Physical Layer)\
    \ layers without router\n   functionality and operate as a bridge.  The BS should\
    \ support IPv6\n   classifiers as specified in [IEEE802.16].\n"
- title: 2.2.1.2.  Addressing
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.2.  Addressing\n   An IPv6 MS has two possible options to get an IPv6 address.\
    \  These\n   options will be equally applied to the other scenario below (Section\n\
    \   2.2.2).\n   (1) An IPv6 MS can get the IPv6 address from an access router\
    \ using\n   stateless auto-configuration.  In this case, router discovery and\n\
    \   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) operation should be properly\n   operated\
    \ over an IEEE 802.16 link.\n   (2) An IPv6 MS can use Dynamic Host Configuration\
    \ Protocol for IPv6\n   (DHCPv6) to get an IPv6 address from the DHCPv6 server.\
    \  In this\n   case, the DHCPv6 server would be located in the service provider\
    \ core\n   network, and the AR should provide a DHCPv6 relay agent.  This option\n\
    \   is similar to what we do today in case of DHCPv4.\n   In this scenario, a\
    \ router and multiple BSs form an IPv6 subnet, and\n   a single prefix is allocated\
    \ to all the attached MSs.  All MSs\n   attached to the same AR can be on the\
    \ same IPv6 link.\n   As for the prefix assignment, in the case of the shared\
    \ IPv6 prefix\n   link model, one or more IPv6 prefixes are assigned to the link\
    \ and\n   are hence shared by all the nodes that are attached to the link.  In\n\
    \   the point-to-point link model, the AR assigns a unique prefix or a\n   set\
    \ of unique prefixes for each MS.  Prefix delegation can be\n   required if networks\
    \ exist behind an MS.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.3.  IPv6 Transport
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.3.  IPv6 Transport\n   In an IPv6 subnet, there are always two underlying\
    \ links: one is the\n   IEEE 802.16 wireless link between the MS and BS, and the\
    \ other is a\n   wired link between the BS and AR.\n   IPv6 packets can be sent\
    \ and received via the IP-specific part of the\n   packet convergence sublayer.\
    \  The Packet CS is used for the transport\n   of packet-based protocols, which\
    \ include Ethernet and Internet\n   Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6).  Note that in this\
    \ scenario, IPv6 CS may be\n   more appropriate than Ethernet CS to transport\
    \ IPv6 packets, since\n   there is some overhead of Ethernet CS (e.g., Ethernet\
    \ header) under\n   mobile access environments.  However, when PHS (Payload Header\n\
    \   Suppression) is deployed, it mitigates this overhead through the\n   compression\
    \ of packet headers.  The details of IPv6 operations over\n   the IP-specific\
    \ part of the packet CS are defined in [RFC5121].\n   Simple or complex network\
    \ equipment may constitute the underlying\n   wired network between the AR and\
    \ the ER.  If the IP-aware equipment\n   between the AR and the ER does not support\
    \ IPv6, the service\n   providers can deploy IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling mechanisms\
    \ to transport\n   IPv6 packets between the AR and the ER.\n   The service providers\
    \ are deploying tunneling mechanisms to transport\n   IPv6 over their existing\
    \ IPv4 networks as well as deploying native\n   IPv6 where possible.  Native IPv6\
    \ should be preferred over tunneling\n   mechanisms as native IPv6 deployment\
    \ options might be more scalable\n   and provide the required service performance.\
    \  Tunneling mechanisms\n   should only be used when native IPv6 deployment is\
    \ not an option.\n   This can be equally applied to other scenarios below (Section\
    \ 2.2.2).\n"
- title: 2.2.1.4.  Routing
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.4.  Routing\n   In general, the MS is configured with a default route that\
    \ points to\n   the AR.  Therefore, no routing protocols are needed on the MS.\
    \  The\n   MS just sends to the AR using the default route.\n   The AR can configure\
    \ multiple links to the ER for network\n   reliability.  The AR should support\
    \ IPv6 routing protocols such as\n   OSPFv3 [RFC2740] or Intermediate System to\
    \ Intermediate System\n   (IS-IS) for IPv6 when connected to the ER with multiple\
    \ links.\n   The ER runs the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) such as OSPFv3 or\n\
    \   IS-IS for IPv6 in the service provider network.  The routing\n   information\
    \ of the ER can be redistributed to the AR.  Prefix\n   summarization should be\
    \ done at the ER.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.5.  Mobility
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.5.  Mobility\n   There are two types of handovers for the IEEE 802.16e\
    \ networks: link\n   layer handover and IP layer handover.  In a link layer handover,\
    \ BSs\n   involved in the handover reside in the same IP subnet.  An MS only\n\
    \   needs to reestablish a link layer connection with a new BS without\n   changing\
    \ its IP configuration, such as its IP address, default\n   router, on-link prefix,\
    \ etc.  The link layer handover in IEEE 802.16e\n   is by nature a hard handover\
    \ since the MS has to cut off the\n   connection with the current BS at the beginning\
    \ of the handover\n   process and cannot resume communication with the new BS\
    \ until the\n   handover completes [IEEE802.16e].  In an IP layer handover, the\
    \ BSs\n   involved reside in different IP subnets, or in different networks.\n\
    \   Thus, in an IP layer handover, an MS needs to establish both a new\n   link\
    \ layer connection, as in a link layer handover, and a new IP\n   configuration\
    \ to maintain connectivity.\n   IP layer handover for MSs is handled by Mobile\
    \ IPv6 [RFC3775].\n   Mobile IPv6 defines that movement detection uses Neighbor\n\
    \   Unreachability Detection to detect when the default router is no\n   longer\
    \ bidirectionally reachable, in which case the mobile node must\n   discover a\
    \ new default router.  Periodic Router Advertisements for\n   reachability and\
    \ movement detection may be unnecessary because the\n   IEEE 802.16 MAC provides\
    \ the reachability by its ranging procedure\n   and the movement detection by\
    \ the Handoff procedure.\n   Mobile IPv6 alone will not solve the handover latency\
    \ problem for the\n   IEEE 802.16e networks.  To reduce or eliminate packet loss\
    \ and to\n   reduce the handover delay in Mobile IPv6, therefore, Fast Handover\n\
    \   for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) [RFC4068] can be deployed together with\n   MIPv6.\
    \  To perform predictive packet forwarding, the FMIPv6's IP\n   layer assumes\
    \ the presence of handover-related triggers delivered by\n   the IEEE 802.16 MAC\
    \ layers.  Thus, there is a need for cross-layering\n   design to support proper\
    \ behavior of the FMIPv6 solution.  This issue\n   is also discussed in [MIPSHOP-FH80216E].\n\
    \   Also, [IEEE802.16g] defines L2 triggers for link status such as\n   link-up,\
    \ link-down, and handoff-start.  These L2 triggers may make\n   the Mobile IPv6\
    \ or FMIPv6 procedure more efficient and faster.\n   In addition, due to the problems\
    \ caused by the existence of multiple\n   convergence sublayers [RFC4840], the\
    \ mobile access scenarios need\n   solutions about how roaming will work when\
    \ forced to move from one CS\n   to another (e.g., IPv6 CS to Ethernet CS).  Note\
    \ that, at this phase,\n   this issue is the out of scope of this document.\n"

  - "2.2.2.1.  IPv6-Related Infrastructure Changes\n   IPv6 will be deployed in this\
    \ scenario by upgrading the following\n   devices to dual stack: MS, AR, ER, and\
    \ the Ethernet bridge.  The BS\n   should support IPv6 classifiers as specified\
    \ in [IEEE802.16].\n   The BRAS in Figure 5 is providing the functionality of\
    \ the AR.  An\n   Ethernet bridge is necessary for protecting the BRAS from 802.16\
    \ link\n   layer peculiarities.  The Ethernet bridge relays all traffic received\n\
    \   through the BS to its network side port(s) connected to the BRAS.\n   Any\
    \ traffic received from the BRAS is relayed to the appropriate BS.\n   Since the\
    \ 802.16 MAC layer has no native support for multicast (and\n   broadcast) in\
    \ the uplink direction, the Ethernet bridge will\n   implement multicast (and\
    \ broadcast) by relaying the multicast frame\n   received from the MS to all of\
    \ its ports.  The Ethernet bridge may\n   also provide some IPv6-specific functions\
    \ to increase link efficiency\n   of the 802.16 radio link (see Section 2.2.2.3).\n"

- title: 2.4.  IPv6 QoS
  contents:
  - "2.4.  IPv6 QoS\n   In IEEE 802.16 networks, a connection is unidirectional and\
    \ has a\n   Quality of Service (QoS) specification.  Each connection is\n   associated\
    \ with a single data service flow, and each service flow is\n   associated with\
    \ a set of QoS parameters in [IEEE802.16].  The QoS-\n   related parameters are\
    \ managed using the Dynamic Service Addition\n   (DSA) and Dynamic Service Change\
    \ (DSC) MAC management messages\n   specified in [IEEE802.16].  The [IEEE802.16]\
    \ provides QoS\n   differentiation for the different types of applications by\
    \ five\n   scheduling services.  Four scheduling services are defined in 802.16:\n\
    \   Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS), real-time Polling Service (rtPS),\n   non-real-time\
    \ Polling Service (nrtPS), and Best Effort (BE).  A fifth\n   scheduling service\
    \ is Extended Real-time Polling Service (ertPS),\n   defined in [IEEE802.16e].\
    \  It is required to define IP layer quality\n   of service mapping to MAC layer\
    \ QoS types [IEEE802.16],\n   [IEEE802.16e].\n"

    \ by the\n   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server located\
    \ at\n   its service provider network.  To achieve that, the MS and the BS use\n\
    \   Privacy Key Management [IEEE802.16],[IEEE802.16e], while the BS\n   communicates\
    \ with the AAA server using a AAA protocol.  Once the MS\n   is authenticated\
    \ with the AAA server, it can associate successfully\n   with the BS and acquire\
    \ an IPv6 address through stateless auto-\n   configuration or DHCPv6.  Note that\
    \ the initiation and authentication\n   process is the same as the one used in\

  contents:
  - "2.6.  IPv6 Network Management\n   [IEEE802.16f] includes the management information\
    \ base for IEEE\n   802.16 networks.  For IPv6 network management, the necessary\n\
    \   instrumentation (such as MIBs, NetFlow Records, etc.) should be\n   available.\n\
    \   Upon entering the network, an MS is assigned three management\n   connections\
    \ in each direction.  These three connections reflect the\n   three different\
    \ QoS requirements used by different management levels.\n   The first of these\
    \ is the basic connection, which is used for the\n   transfer of short, time-critical\
    \ MAC management messages and radio\n   link control (RLC) messages.  The primary\
    \ management connection is\n   used to transfer longer, more delay-tolerant messages\
    \ such as those\n   used for authentication and connection setup.  The secondary\n\
    \   management connection is used for the transfer of standards-based\n   management\
    \ messages such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n   (DHCP), Trivial File\
    \ Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and Simple Network\n   Management Protocol (SNMP).\n\
    \   IPv6-based IEEE 802.16 networks can be managed by IPv4 or IPv6 when\n   network\
    \ elements are implemented dual stack.  SNMP messages can be\n   carried by either\

    \ implications for\n   protocols that are designed to work within the scope. \
    \ This is the\n   concern for a shared prefix link model wherein private resources\n\
    \   cannot be put onto a public 802.16-based network.  This may restrict\n   the\
