  contents:
  - "The minor points first:\n    1.  <CA> and <CA2> are not explained until the formal\
    \ syntax. It\n    would be more convenient, if they were explained sooner.\n \
    \   2. The Proposed <CA2> is a bad thing, since it is the Telnet Go-\n    Ahead,\
    \ which should not be used by higher level protocols.\n    3. The default SIGNATURE\
    \ should be the sign-on or ident of the\n    author(s).\n    4. The Disposition\
    \ INTERRUPT would be more useful if it had\n    author/clerk-assigned \"levels\"\
    . Currently mail would be either\n    urgent or not. With levels (say 1 to 10),\
    \ the sender could rate the\n    degree of urgency.\n        There would be no\
    \ precise defined meaning to any of these\n        levels, merely the opportunity\
    \ for a subjective evaluation by\n        the sender. The receiver (process or\
    \ person) may do whatever\n        they wish with the information.\n        A\
    \ user could thereby direct a receiving process to notify him\n        immediately\
    \ of Priority 5 or higher Short mail or any Priority\n        10 mail immediately,\
    \ but defer notification of any other mail.\n        (Length is discussed later\
    \ in this note.)\n    5. Also, we would like the  word, \"INTERRUPT\", to be changed\
    \ to\n    URGENT or PRIORITY\n    6. In keeping with offering the sender the opportunity\
    \ to 'rate' his\n    mail, we would like to allow him the chance to warn the receiver\
    \ of\n    the size of the mail.  This could be a byte count and/or an\n    imprecise\
    \ SHORT/MEDIUM/LONG.  Again, the receiver may use this\n    information as he/it\
    \ sees fit.\n    7. The ID command seems confusing.\n        If I am a clerk and\
    \ sending to someone on another host, that\n        host may ask me to 'prove'\
    \ my identity by using an ID. How can\n        the Sigma-7 at UCLA-NMC know WHITE's\
    \ id? He does not have one on\n        the Sigma, but certainly should be able\
    \ to send mail to us\n        there.\n    8. How do ACK's, Progress Reports, or\
    \ Replies work when there is no\n    Reference Serial number?\n    9. Please include\
    \ the  distinction between Static and Dynamic\n    attributes as part of the formal\
    \ syntax.\n    10. Though hosts must be allowed to require a login, before they\n\
    \    will accept mail,  would like the Protocol document to reflect a\n    negative\
    \ attitude towards such a requirement.\n    11. In describing defaults, relatively\
    \ cryptic phrases such as\n    \"Author to the Clerk\" are sometimes used. Please\
    \ be a bit more\n    clear.\n    12. The sender is required to send Static, Dynamic,\
    \ and then\n    Optional parameters.\n        This requires receiving hosts to\
    \ buffer the contents before\n        passing them on to the appropriate recipient.\
    \ (In fact, before\n        finding out whether it can/will accept the mail.)\n\
    \        The order should be: Dynamic, Optional, Static.\n        By requiring\
    \ the sending host to transmit the dynamic and\n        optional attributes first,\
    \ the receiving host can also reroute\n        mail based upon its Priority and\
    \ Length.\n"
- title: 'Now for the hairier problems:'

  - "Now for the hairier problems:\n    1. We would like to make a strong statement\
    \ in favor of the\n    unified-access (one selector process with one listening\
    \ socket)\n    approach.  However, since it does not exist, yet:\n        The\
    \ Mail Protocol should NOT be a subsystem of FTP. The Mail\n        Protocol USES\
    \ the File Transfer Protocol, the same as RJE uses\n        FTP. We therefore\
    \ suggest the use of the RJE model.\n        This unfortunately opens up the issue\
    \ of logging in, to send\n        mail. The advantage of having FTP have a MAIL\
    \ command is that it\n        defines a class of data transfer which many hosts\
    \ will allow for\n        free, while maintaining control over other, 'normal'\
    \ file\n        transfer.\n        The solution should be the same as that currently\
    \ used by RJE.\n    2. The FORWARD function allows a site to receive and hold\
    \ mail\n    during and/or, until a transfer request is received from the\n   \
    \ 'recipient' at another host.\n        This action takes place AFTER receipt\
    \ of the mail, so we would\n        like to suggest a command for \"Rerouting\"\
    \ mail just PRIOR to its\n        receipt.\n        This allows a receiving host\
    \ to refuse a given piece of mail,\n        but suggest an alternate receiver.\
    \ This would be useful if the\n        recipient were using  another host for\
    \ a while, or if the\n        recipient  didn't want to rack up storage charges\
    \ at the first\n        site.\n        Three variation can occur, one of which\
    \ will require a special\n        MP reply code:\n            Automatic forwarding:\
    \  Accept the mail and then\n            automatically transfer it to the user's\
    \ alternate mailbox.\n                This could be classed as a user  \"feature\"\
    \  and would\n                not be part of the protocol.  However, it would\
    \ be quite\n                useful.\n            Automatic forwarding with copy\
    \ held:  The same as the first\n            case, but the transferring server\
    \ keeps a copy of the mail.\n            Rerouting without accepting:  The mail\
    \ is never accepted\n            from the sender. The sender is, however, informed\
    \ of an\n            alternate mailbox.\n                The Rerouting information\
    \ would be in reply to a\n                RECIPIENT command.\n               \
