- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is often useful in documentation, IETF documents, etc.,\
    \ to provide\n   examples containing IP multicast addresses.  For documentation\
    \ where\n   examples of general purpose multicast addresses are needed, one\n\
    \   should use multicast addresses that will never be assigned or in\n   actual\
    \ use.  There is a risk that addresses used in examples may\n   accidentally be\
    \ used.  It is then important that the same addresses\n   not be used by other\
    \ multicast applications or services.  It may also\n   be beneficial to filter\
    \ out such addresses from multicast signalling\n   and to filter out multicast\
    \ data sent to such addresses.\n   For unicast, there are both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\
    \ reserved for this\n   purpose; see [RFC5737] and [RFC3849], respectively.  This\
    \ document\n   reserves multicast addresses for this same purpose.\n   There are\
    \ also some multicast addresses that are derived from AS\n   numbers or unicast\
    \ addresses.  For examples where such addresses are\n   desired, one should derive\
    \ them from the AS numbers and unicast\n   addresses reserved for documentation\
    \ purposes.  This document also\n   discusses the use of these.\n"
- title: 2.  IPv4 Multicast Documentation Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.  IPv4 Multicast Documentation Addresses\n   For Any-Source Multicast (ASM),\
    \ the IPv4 multicast addresses\n   allocated for documentation purposes are 233.252.0.0\
    \ - 233.252.0.255\n   (233.252.0.0/24).\n   For Source-Specific Multicast (SSM),\
    \ it is less important which\n   multicast addresses are used, since a host/application\
    \ joins a\n   channel identified by both source and group.  Any source addresses\n\
    \   used in SSM examples should be unicast addresses reserved for\n   documentation\
    \ purposes.  There are three unicast address ranges\n   provided for documentation\
    \ use in [RFC5737].  The ranges are\n   192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24.\n\
    \   Sometimes one wants to give examples where a specific type of address\n  \
    \ is desired.  For example, for text about multicast scoping, one might\n   want\
    \ the examples to use addresses that are to be used for\n   administrative scoping.\
    \  See below for guidance on how to construct\n   specific types of example addresses.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Administratively Scoped IPv4 Multicast Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Administratively Scoped IPv4 Multicast Addresses\n   Administratively scoped\
    \ IPv4 multicast addresses [RFC2365] are\n   reserved for scoped multicast.  They\
    \ can be used within a site or an\n   organization.  Apart from a small set of\
    \ scope-relative addresses,\n   these addresses are not assigned.  The high order\
    \ /24 in every scope\n   is reserved for relative assignments.  A relative assignment\
    \ is an\n   integer offset from the highest address in the scope and represents\n\
    \   an IPv4 address.  For documentation purposes, the integer offset is\n   10.\
    \  This provides one multicast address per scope.\n   For example in the Local\
    \ Scope 239.255.0.0/16, the multicast address\n   for documentation purposes is\
    \ 239.255.255.245.\n"
- title: 2.2.  GLOP Multicast Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.2.  GLOP Multicast Addresses\n   GLOP [RFC3180] is a method for deriving IPv4\
    \ multicast group\n   addresses from 16-bit AS numbers.  For examples where GLOP\
    \ addresses\n   are desired, the addresses should be derived from the AS numbers\n\
    \   reserved for documentation use.\n   The 16-bit AS numbers reserved for documentation\
    \ use in [RFC5398] are\n   64496 - 64511.  By use of [RFC3180], we then get 16\
    \ /24 multicast\n   prefixes for documentation use.  The first one is 233.251.240.0/24,\n\
    \   and the last one is 233.251.255.0/24.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Unicast Prefix-Based IPv4 Multicast Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Unicast Prefix-Based IPv4 Multicast Addresses\n   IPv4 multicast addresses\
    \ can be derived from IPv4 unicast prefixes,\n   see [RFC6034].  For examples\
    \ where this type of address is desired,\n   the addresses should be derived from\
    \ the unicast addresses reserved\n   for documentation purposes, see [RFC5737].\n\
    \   There are three unicast address ranges provided for documentation use\n  \
    \ in [RFC5737].  The ranges are 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, and\n   203.0.113.0/24.\
    \  Using [RFC6034], this leaves the unicast prefix-\n   based IPv4 multicast addresses\
    \ 234.192.0.2, 234.198.51.100, and\n   234.203.0.113.\n"
- title: 3.  IPv6 Multicast Documentation Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.  IPv6 Multicast Documentation Addresses\n   For Any-Source Multicast (ASM),\
    \ the IPv6 multicast addresses\n   allocated for documentation purposes are FF0X::DB8:0:0/96.\
    \  This is a\n   /96 prefix so that it can be used with group IDs, according to\
    \ the\n   allocation guidelines in [RFC3307].  Also note that for these\n   addresses,\
    \ the transient flag, or \"T-flag\" as defined in [RFC4291],\n   is zero.  This\
    \ is because they are permanently assigned.  There can\n   be no permanently assigned\
    \ addresses for documentation purposes with\n   the transient flag set to one,\
    \ since the flag set to one means that\n   they are not permanently assigned.\n\
    \   For Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), it is less important which\n   multicast\
    \ addresses are used, since a host/application joins a\n   channel identified\
    \ by both source and group.  Any source addresses\n   used in SSM examples should\
    \ be unicast addresses reserved for\n   documentation purposes.  The IPv6 unicast\
    \ prefix reserved for\n   documentation purposes is 2001:DB8::/32, see [RFC3849].\n\
    \   Sometimes one wants to give examples where a specific type of address\n  \
    \ is desired.  For example, for text about multicast scoping, one might\n   want\
    \ the examples to use addresses that are to be used for\n   administrative scoping.\
    \  See below for guidance on how to construct\n   specific types of example addresses.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Unicast Prefix-Based IPv6 Multicast Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Unicast Prefix-Based IPv6 Multicast Addresses\n   IPv6 multicast addresses\
    \ can be derived from IPv6 unicast prefixes,\n   see [RFC3306].  For examples\
    \ where this type of address is desired,\n   the addresses should be derived from\
    \ the unicast addresses reserved\n   for documentation purposes.\n   The IPv6\
    \ unicast prefix reserved for documentation purposes is 2001:\n   DB8::/32, see\
    \ [RFC3849].  This allows a wide range of different IPv6\n   multicast addresses.\
    \  Using just the base /32 prefix, one gets the\n   IPv6 multicast prefixes FF3X:20:2001:DB8::/64\
    \ -- one for each\n   available scope X.  One can also produce longer prefixes\
    \ from this.\n   Just as an example, one can pick a /64 prefix 2001:DB8:DEAD:\n\
    \   BEEF::/64, which gives the multicast prefixes FF3X:40:2001:DB8:DEAD:\n   BEEF::/96\
    \ -- one for each available scope X.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Embedded-RP IPv6 Multicast Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Embedded-RP IPv6 Multicast Addresses\n   There is a type of IPv6 multicast\
    \ address called an \"Embedded-RP\"\n   address, where the IPv6 address of a Rendezvous-Point\
    \ (RP) is\n   embedded inside the multicast address, see [RFC3956].  For examples\n\
    \   where this type of address is desired, the addresses should be\n   derived\
    \ from the unicast addresses reserved for documentation\n   purposes, see [RFC3849].\n\
    \   For documentation purposes, the RP address can be any address from\n   the\
    \ range 2001:DB8::/32 that follows the constraints specified in\n   [RFC3956].\
    \  One example address could be 2001:DB8::1.  The\n   Embedded-RP multicast prefixes\
    \ might then be FF7X:120:2001:DB8::/96.\n   Another example could be the RP address\
    \ 2001:DB8:BEEF:FEED::7, which\n   gives the prefixes FF7X:740:2001:DB8:BEEF:FEED::/96.\
    \  See also the\n   examples in [RFC3956].\n"
