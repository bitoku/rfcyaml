  - "1.  Introduction\n   The first definition for many URI schemes appears in [RFC1738].
    \ This\n   memo extracts the 'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes from it to allow that\n
    \  material to remain on the Standards Track if [RFC1738] is moved to\n   \"historic\"
    status.  It belongs to a series of similar documents like\n   [RFC4156], [RFC4157],
    [RFC4248], and [RFC4266], which are discussed\n   on the <mailto:uri@w3.org> list.\n
    \  The definitions for the 'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes given here are\n   updates
    from [RFC1738] based on modern usage of these schemes.  This\n   memo intentionally
    limits its description of the 'news' URI scheme to\n   essential features supposed
    to work with \"any browser\" and Network\n   News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) server.\n
    \  [RFC3986] specifies how to define schemes for URIs; it also explains\n   the
    term \"Uniform Resource Locator\" (URL).  The Network News Transfer\n   Protocol
    (NNTP) is specified in [RFC3977].  The Netnews Article\n   Format is defined in
    [RFC5536].\n   The key word \"MUST\" in this memo is to be interpreted as described
    in\n   [RFC2119].  UTF-8 is specified in [RFC3629].  The syntax uses the\n   ABNF
    defined in [RFC5234].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   The 'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes identify resources on an
    NNTP\n   server, individual articles, individual newsgroups, or sets of\n   newsgroups.\n
    \  User agents like Web browsers supporting these schemes use the NNTP\n   protocol
    to access the corresponding resources.  The details of how\n   they do this, e.g.,
    employing a separate or integrated newsreader,\n   depend on the implementation.
    \ The default <port> associated with\n   NNTP in [RFC3977] is 119.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  'nntp' URIs\n   The 'nntp' URI scheme identifies articles in a newsgroup
      on a\n   specific NNTP server.  In [RFC3986] terminology, this means that\n
      \  'nntp' URIs have a non-empty <authority> component; there is no\n   default
      <host> as for the 'file' or 'news' URI schemes.\n   Netnews is typically distributed
      among several news servers, using\n   the same newsgroup names but local article
      numbers.  An article\n   available as number 10 in group \"example\" on server\n
      \  \"news.example.com\" has most likely a different number on any other\n   server
      where the same article is still available.  Users allowed to\n   read and post
      articles on \"their\" server may not be allowed to access\n   articles on an
      \"arbitrary\" server specified in an 'nntp' URI.\n   For these reasons, the
      use of the 'nntp' URI scheme is limited, and\n   it is less widely supported
      by user agents than the similar 'news'\n   URI scheme.\n"
    title: 2.1.  'nntp' URIs
  - contents:
    - "2.2.  'news' URIs\n   The 'news' URI scheme identifies articles by their worldwide
      unique\n   \"Message-ID\", independent of the server and the newsgroup.\n   Newsreaders
      support access to articles by their \"Message-ID\", without\n   the overhead
      of a URI scheme.  In simple cases, they do this directly\n   as an NNTP client
      of a default or currently used server as configured\n   by the user.  More general
      user agents use the 'news' URI scheme to\n   distinguish \"Message-IDs\" from
      similar constructs such as other URI\n   schemes in contexts such as a plain
      text message body.\n   The 'news' URI scheme also allows the identification
      of newsgroups or\n   sets of newsgroups independent of a specific server.  For
      Netnews, a\n   group \"example\" has the same name on any server carrying this
      group,\n   exotic cases involving gateways notwithstanding.  To distinguish\n
      \  \"Message-IDs\" and newsgroup names, the 'news' URI scheme relies on\n   the
      \"@\" between local part (left-hand side) and domain part (right-\n   hand side)
      of \"Message-IDs\".\n   [RFC1738] offered only one wildcard for sets of newsgroups
      in 'news'\n   URIs, a \"*\" used to refer to \"all available newsgroups\".  In
      common\n   practice, this was extended to varying degrees by different user\n
      \  agents.  An NNTP extension known as <wildmat>, specified in [RFC2980]\n   and
      now part of the base NNTP specification, allows pattern matching\n   in the
      style of the [POSIX] \"find\" command.  For the purpose of this\n   memo, this
      means that some additional special characters have to be\n   allowed in 'news'
      URIs, some of them percent-encoded as required by\n   the overall [RFC3986]
      URI syntax.  User agents and NNTP servers not\n   yet compliant with [RFC3977]
      do not implement all parts of this new\n   feature.\n   Another commonly supported
      addition to the [RFC1738] syntax is the\n   optional specification of a server
      at the beginning of 'news' URIs.\n   This optional <authority> component follows
      the overall [RFC3986]\n   syntax, preceded by a double slash \"//\" and terminated
      by the next\n   slash \"/\", question mark \"?\", number sign \"#\", or the
      end of the URI.\n"
    title: 2.2.  'news' URIs
  - contents:
    - "2.3.  Query Parts, Fragments, and Normalization\n   Fragments introduced by
      a number sign \"#\" are specified in [RFC3986];\n   the semantics is independent
      of the URI scheme, and the resolution\n   depends on the media type.\n   This
      memo doesn't specify a query part introduced by a question mark\n   \"?\" for
      the 'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes, but some implementations\n   are known to
      use query parts instead of fragments internally to\n   address parts of a composite
      media type [RFC2046] in Multipurpose\n   Internet Mail Extensions (MIME).\n
      \  There are no special \".\" or \"..\" path segments in 'news' and 'nntp'\n
      \  URLs.  Please note that \".\" and \"..\" are not valid <newsgroup-name>s.\n
      \  URI producers have to percent-encode some characters as specified\n   below
      (Section 4); otherwise, they MUST treat a \"Message-ID\" without\n   angle brackets
      for 'news' URLs as is, i.e., case-sensitive.\n"

- contents:
  - "3.  Syntax of 'nntp' URIs\n   An 'nntp' URI identifies an article by its number
    in a given\n   newsgroup on a specified server, or it identifies the newsgroup\n
    \  without article number.\n       nntpURL         = \"nntp:\" server \"/\" group
    [ \"/\" article-number ]\n       server          = \"//\" authority               ;
    see RFC 3986\n       group           = 1*( group-char / pct-encoded )\n       article-number
    \ = 1*16DIGIT                    ; see RFC 3977\n       group-char      = ALPHA
    / DIGIT / \"-\" / \"+\" / \"_\" / \".\"\n   In the form with an <article-number>,
    the URL corresponds roughly to\n   the content of an <xref> header field as specified
    in [RFC5536],\n   replacing its more general <article-locator> by the <article-number>\n
    \  used with the NNTP.\n   A <newsgroup-name> as specified in [RFC5536] consists
    of dot-\n   separated components.  Each component contains one or more letters,\n
    \  digits, \"-\" (hyphen-minus), \"+\", or \"_\" (underscore).  These\n   characters
    can be directly used in a segment of a path in an\n   [RFC3986] URI; no percent-encoding
    is necessary.  Example:\n       nntp://news.server.example/example.group.this/12345\n
    \  A <wildmat-exact> newsgroup name as specified in [RFC3977] allows (in\n   theory)
    any <UTF8-non-ascii> (see Section 6) and most printable\n   US-ASCII characters,
    excluding \"!\", \"*\", \",\", \"?\", \"[\", \"\\\", and \"]\".\n   However, [RFC5536]
    does not (yet) permit characters outside of\n   <group-char> and so, to keep the
    syntax simple, the additional\n   characters are here covered by <pct-encoded>
    as defined in [RFC3986],\n   since most of them have to be percent-encoded anyway
    (with a few\n   exceptions, such as \":\", \";\", and \"~\").  Example:\n       nntp://wild.server.example/example.group.n%2Fa/12345\n
    \  In the form without <article-number>, the URL identifies a single\n   group
    on the specified server.  This is also possible with an\n   equivalent 'news'
    URL, and the latter is better supported by user\n   agents.  Example:\n       nntp://news.server.example/example.group.this\n
    \      news://news.server.example/example.group.this\n"
  title: 3.  Syntax of 'nntp' URIs
- contents:
  - "4.  Syntax of 'news' URIs\n   A 'news' URI identifies an article by its unique
    \"Message-ID\", or it\n   identifies a set of newsgroups.  Additionally, it can
    specify a\n   server; when the server is not specified, a configured default server\n
    \  for Netnews access is used.\n       newsURL         = \"news:\" [ server \"/\"
    ] ( article / newsgroups )\n       article         = msg-id-core                  ;
    see RFC 5536\n   The form identifying an <article> is the <msg-id-core> from\n
    \  [RFC5536]; it is a \"Message-ID\" without angle brackets.  According to\n   [RFC3986],
    characters that are in <gen-delims> (a subset of\n   <reserved>), together with
    the character \"%\", MUST be percent-encoded\n   (though it is not wrong to encode
    others).  Specifically, the\n   characters allowed in <msg-id-core> that must
    be encoded are\n       \"/\"  \"?\"  \"#\"  \"[\" \"]\" and \"%\"\n   Note that
    an agent which seeks to interpret a 'news' URI needs to\n   decode all percent-encoded
    characters before passing it on to an NNTP\n   server to be acted upon.\n   Please
    note that \"%3E\" (\">\") is not allowed; <msg-id-core> is\n   otherwise identical
    to\n           id-left \"@\" id-right\n   as defined in [RFC5322].\n   The form
    identifying <newsgroups> corresponds to the [RFC3977]\n   <wildmat-pattern>, a
    newsgroup name with wildcards \"*\" and \"?\".  Any\n   \"?\" has to be percent-encoded
    as \"%3F\" in this part of a URI.\n   Examples (the first two are equivalent):\n
    \      news://news.server.example/*\n       news://news.server.example/\n       news://wild.server.example/example.group.th%3Fse\n
    \      news:example.group.*\n       news:example.group.this\n   Without wildcards,
    this form of the URL identifies a single group if\n   it is not empty.  User agents
    would typically try to present an\n   overview of the articles available in this
    group, likely somehow\n   limiting this overview to the newest unread articles
    up to a\n   configured maximum.\n   With wildcards, user agents could try to list
    matching group names on\n   the specified or default server.  Some user agents
    support only a\n   specific <group> without wildcards, or an optional single \"*\".\n
    \  As noted above (Section 2.2), the presence of an \"@\" in a 'news' URI\n   disambiguates
    <article> and <newsgroups> for URI consumers.  The new\n   <message-id> construct
    specified in [RFC3977] does not require an\n   \"@\".  Since [RFC0822], the \"Message-ID\"
    syntax has been closely\n   related to the syntax of mail addresses with an \"@\"
    separating left-\n   hand side (local part of addresses, unique part of message\n
    \  identifiers) and right-hand side (domain part), and this memo sticks\n   to
    the known [RFC1738] practice.\n"

    \  considerations are not listed below.  For an overview, see [UTR36]\n   and
    [RFC3629].\n   The work on Email Address Internationalization (EAI), started in\n
    \  [RFC4952], is not expected to change the syntax of a \"Message-ID\".\n"
  title: 6.  Internationalization Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are many security considerations for URI
    schemes discussed in\n   [RFC3986].  The NNTP protocol may use passwords in the
    clear for\n   authentication or offer no privacy, both of which are considered\n
    \  extremely unsafe in current practice.  Alternatives and further\n   security
    considerations with respect to the NNTP are discussed in\n   [RFC4642] and [RFC4643].\n
    \  The syntax for the 'news' and 'nntp' URI schemes contains the general\n   <authority>
    construct with an optional <userinfo> defined in\n   [RFC3986].  As noted in [RFC3986],
    the \"user:password\" form of a\n   <userinfo> is deprecated.\n   Articles on
    NNTP servers typically expire after some time.  After\n   that time, corresponding
    'news' and 'nntp' URLs may not work anymore\n   depending on the server.  While
    a \"Message-ID\" is supposed to be\n   worldwide unique forever, the NNTP protocol
    does not guarantee this.\n   Under various conditions depending on the servers,
    the same\n   \"Message-ID\" could be used for different articles, and attackers\n
    \  could try to distribute malicious content for known 'news' or 'nntp'\n   URLs.\n
    \  If a URI does not match the generic syntax in [RFC3986], it is\n   invalid,
    and broken URIs can cause havoc.  Compare [RFC5064] for\n   similar security considerations.\n"

  - "Appendix B.  Detailed Example\n   Here is an example of a mail to the <mailto:tools.discuss@ietf.org>\n
    \  list with \"Message-ID\" <p0624081dc30b8699bf9b@[10.20.30.108]>.\n   <http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.tools>
    is one of the various list\n   archives; it converts mail into Netnews articles.
    \ The header of this\n   article contains the following fields (among others):\n
    \         Message-ID: <p0624081dc30b8699bf9b@[10.20.30.108]>\n          Xref:
    news.gmane.org gmane.ietf.tools:742\n          Archived-At: <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.tools/742>\n
    \  The \"Xref\" roughly indicates the 742nd article in newsgroup\n   <news://news.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.tools>
    on this server.  An 'nntp'\n   URL might be <nntp://news.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.tools/742>.
    \ For\n   details about the \"Archived-At\" URL, see [RFC5064].\n   The list software
    and list subscribers reading the list elsewhere\n   can't predict a server-specific
    article number 742 in this archive.\n   If they know this server, they can however
    guess the corresponding\n   <news://news.gmane.org/p0624081dc30b8699bf9b@%5B10.20.30.108%5D>
    URL.\n   In theory, the list software could use the guessed 'news' URL in an\n
    \  \"Archived-At\" header field, but if a list tries this, it would likely\n   use
    <http://mid.gmane.org/p0624081dc30b8699bf9b@%5B10.20.30.108%5D>.\n   Using domain
    literals in a \"Message-ID\" could cause collisions.  A\n   collision might force
    the mail2news gateway in this example to invent\n   a new \"Message-ID\", and
    an attempt to guess the future URL on this\n   server would then fail.\n"
