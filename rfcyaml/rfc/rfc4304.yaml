  - "Abstract\n   The IP Security Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security\n
    \  Payload (ESP) protocols use a sequence number to detect replay.  This\n   document
    describes extensions to the Internet IP Security Domain of\n   Interpretation
    (DOI) for the Internet Security Association and Key\n   Management Protocol (ISAKMP).
    \ These extensions support negotiation\n   of the use of traditional 32-bit sequence
    numbers or extended (64-\n   bit) sequence numbers (ESNs) for a particular AH
    or ESP security\n   association.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The specifications for the IP Authentication Header (AH)
    [AH] and the\n   IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [ESP] describe an option
    for\n   use of extended (64-bit) sequence numbers.  This option permits\n   transmission
    of very large volumes of data at high speeds over an\n   IPsec Security Association,
    without rekeying to avoid sequence number\n   space exhaustion.  This document
    describes the additions to the IPsec\n   DOI for ISAKMP [DOI] that are needed
    to support negotiation of the\n   extended sequence number (ESN) option.\n   The
    keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,\n   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED,
    MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this\n   document, are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC 2119 [Bra97].\n"

    is used in Phase II of an\n   Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE) negotiation.
    \ The attribute type\n   is Basic (B).  Encoding of this attribute is defined
    in the base\n   ISAKMP specification [ISAKMP].  Attributes described as basic
    MUST\n   NOT be encoded as variable.  See [IKE] for further information on\n   attribute
    encoding in the IPsec DOI.  All restrictions listed in\n   [IKE] also apply to
    the IPsec DOI and to this addendum.\n   Attribute Type\n              class                        value

    attribute (or\n   attribute value) that it does not support, an ATTRIBUTES-NOT-SUPPORT\n
    \  SHOULD be sent and the security association setup MUST be aborted.\n   If an
    implementation receives any attribute value but the value for\n   64-bit sequence
    numbers, the security association setup MUST be\n   aborted.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This memo pertains to the Internet Key Exchange
    protocol [IKE], which\n   combines ISAKMP [ISAKMP] and Oakley [OAKLEY] to provide
    for the\n   derivation of cryptographic keying material in a secure and\n   authenticated
    manner.  Specific discussion of the various security\n   protocols and transforms
    identified in this document can be found in\n   the associated base documents
    and in the cipher references.\n   The addition of the ESN attribute does not change
    the underlying\n   security characteristics of IKE.  In using ESNs with ESP, it
    is\n   important to employ an encryption mode that is secure when very large\n
    \  volumes of data are encrypted under a single key.  Thus, for example,\n   Data
    Encryption Standard (DES) in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode\n   would NOT be
    suitable for use with the ESN, because no more than 2^32\n   blocks should be
    encrypted under a single DES key in that mode.\n   Similarly, the integrity algorithm
    used with ESP or AH should be\n   secure relative to the number of packets being
    protected.  To avoid\n   potential security problems imposed by algorithm limitations,
    the SA\n   lifetime may be set to limit the volume of data protected with a\n
    \  single key, prior to reaching the 2^64 packet limit imposed by the\n   ESN.\n"

    by the IANA.\n   No additional class values will be assigned for this attribute.

    \  Type\".  This value is listed under the heading \"value\" in the table\n   in
    Section 2.\n"
