Abstract This document specifies a 224 bit one way hash function, called SHA 224.
SHA 224 is based on SHA 256, but it uses a different initial value and the result is truncated to 224 bits.
This document specifies a 224 bit one way hash function, called SHA 224.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the FIPS 180 2 Change Notice on February 28, 2004 which specifies the SHA 224 one way hash function.
One way hash functions are also known as message digests.
SHA 224 is based on SHA 256, the 256 bit one way
hash function already specified by NIST [SHA2].
Computation of a SHA 224 hash value is two steps.
First, the SHA 256 hash value is computed, except that a different initial value is used.
Second, the resulting 256 bit hash value is truncated to 224 bits.
NIST is developing guidance on cryptographic key management, and NIST recently published a draft for comment [NISTGUIDE].
Five security levels are discussed in the guidance: 80, 112, 128, 192, and 256 bits of security.
One way hash functions are available for all of these levels except one.
SHA 224 fills this void.
SHA 224 is a one way hash function that provides 112 bits of security, which is the generally accepted strength of Triple DES [3DES].
This document makes the SHA 224 one way hash function specification available to the Internet community, and it publishes the object identifiers for use in ASN.1 based protocols.
Since SHA 224 is based on SHA 256, roughly the same amount of effort is consumed to compute a SHA 224 or a SHA 256 digest message digest value.
Even though SHA 224 and SHA 256 have roughly equivalent computational complexity, SHA 224 is an appropriate choice for a one way
hash function that provides 112 bits of security.
The use of a different initial value ensures that a truncated SHA 256 message digest value cannot be mistaken for a SHA 224 message digest value computed on the same data.
Some usage environments are sensitive to every octet that is transmitted.
In these cases, the smaller (by 4 octets) message digest value provided by SHA 224 is important.
These observations lead to the following guidance:
When selecting a suite of cryptographic algorithms that all offer 112 bits of security strength, SHA 224 is an appropriate choice for one way
When terseness is not a selection criteria, the use of SHA 256 is a preferred alternative to SHA 224.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [STDWORDS].
SHA 224 Description SHA 224 may be used to compute a one way hash value on a message
whose length less than 2^64 bits.
SHA 224 makes use of SHA 256
To compute a one way hash value, SHA 256 uses a message schedule of sixty four 32 bit words, eight 32 bit working variables, and produces a hash value of eight 32 bit words.
The function is defined in the exact same manner as SHA 256, with the following two exceptions: First, for SHA 224, the initial hash value of the eight 32 bit working variables, collectively called H, shall consist of the following eight 32 bit words (in hex):
H 5   68581511 H 2
Second, SHA 224 simply makes use of the first seven 32 bit words in the SHA 256 result, discarding the remaining 32 bit words in the SHA 256 result.
That is, the final value of H is used as follows, where    denotes concatenation:
H 0    H 1    H 2    H 3    H 4    H 5    H 6 3.
This section includes three test vectors.
These test vectors can be used to test implementations of SHA 224.
#1 Let the message to be hashed be the 24 bit ASCII string "abc", which is equivalent to the following binary string: 01100001 01100010 01100011
The SHA 224 hash value (in hex): 23097d22
bda255b3 2aadbce4 bda0b3f7 e36c9da7 3.2.
Test Vector #2 Let the message to be hashed be the 448 bit ASCII string "abcdbcdecdefdefgefghfghighijhijkijkljklmklmnlmnomnopnopq".
The SHA 224 hash value is (in hex):
512776cc 5dba5da1 fd890150 b0c6455c b4f58b19 52522525 3.3.
Test Vector #3 Let the message to be hashed be the binary coded form of the ASCII string which consists of 1,000,000 repetitions of the character "
The SHA 224 hash value is (in hex):
Object Identifier NIST has assigned an ASN.1 [X.208 88, X.209 88] object identifier for SHA 224.
Some protocols use object identifiers to name one way hash functions.
One example is CMS [CMS].
Implementations of such protocols that make use of SHA 224 MUST use the following object identifier.
One way hash functions are typically used with other cryptographic algorithms, such as digital signature algorithms and keyed hash message authentication codes, or in the generation of random values.
When a one way hash function is used in conjunction with another algorithm, there may be requirements specified elsewhere that require the use of a one way hash function with a certain number of bits of security.
For example, if a message is being signed with a digital signature algorithm that provides 128 bits of security, then that signature algorithm may require the use of a one way hash algorithm that also provides the same number of bits of security.
SHA 224 is intended to provide 112 bits of security, which is the generally accepted strength of Triple DES [3DES].
This document is intended to provide the SHA 224 specification to the Internet community.
No independent assertion of the security of this one way hash function is intended by the author for any particular use.
However, as long as SHA 256 provides the expected security, SHA 224 will also provide its expected level of security.
