Abstract This document specifies an extension to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to allow the client to read the target entry of an update operation.
The client may request to read the entry before and/or after the modifications are applied.
These reads are done as an atomic part of the update operation.
1.  Background and Intent of Use
This document specifies an extension to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
[RFC4510] to allow the client to read the target entry of an update operation (e.g., Add, Delete, Modify, ModifyDN).
The extension utilizes controls [RFC4511]
attached to update requests to request and return copies of the target entry.
One request control, called the Pre Read request control, indicates that a copy of the entry before application of update is to be returned.
Another control, called the Post Read request control, indicates that a copy of the entry after application of the update is to be returned.
Each request control has a corresponding response control used to return the entry.
To ensure proper isolation, the controls are processed as an atomic part of the update operation.
The functionality offered by these controls is based upon similar functionality in the X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) [X.511].
The Pre Read controls may be used to obtain replaced or deleted values of modified attributes or a copy of the entry being deleted.
The Post Read controls may be used to obtain values of operational attributes, such as the 'entryUUID' [RFC4530] and 'modifyTimestamp' [RFC4512] attributes, updated by the server as part of the update operation.
Terminology Protocol elements are described using ASN.1 [X.680] with implicit tags.
The term "BER encoded" means the element is to be encoded using the Basic Encoding Rules [X.690] under the restrictions detailed in Section 5.1 of [RFC4511].
DN stands for Distinguished Name.
DSA stands for Directory System Agent (i.e., a directory server).
DSE stands for DSA specific Entry.
In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
request and response controls are identified by the 1.3.6.1.1.13.1 object identifier.
Servers implementing these controls SHOULD publish 1.3.6.1.1.13.1 as a value of the 'supportedControl' [RFC4512] in their root DSE.
The Pre Read request control is a LDAP Control [RFC4511] whose controlType is 1.3.6.1.1.13.1 and whose controlValue is a BER encoded AttributeSelection [RFC4511], as extended by [RFC3673].
The criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.
This control is appropriate for the modifyRequest, delRequest, and modDNRequest LDAP messages.
The corresponding response control is a LDAP Control whose controlType is 1.3.6.1.1.13.1 and whose the controlValue, an OCTET STRING, contains a BER encoded SearchResultEntry.
The criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.
This control is appropriate for the modifyResponse, delResponse, and modDNResponse LDAP messages with a resultCode of success (0).
When the request control is attached to an appropriate update LDAP request, the control requests the return of a copy of the target entry prior to the application of the update.
The AttributeSelection indicates, as discussed in [RFC4511][RFC3673], which attributes are requested to appear in the copy.
The server is to return a SearchResultEntry containing, subject to access controls and other constraints, values of the requested attributes.
The normal processing of the update operation and the processing of this control MUST be performed as one atomic action isolated from other update operations.
If the update operation fails (in either normal or control processing), no Pre Read response control is provided.
request and response controls are identified by the 1.3.6.1.1.13.2 object identifier.
Servers implementing these controls SHOULD publish 1.3.6.1.1.13.2 as a value of the 'supportedControl' [RFC4512] in their root DSE.
The Post Read request control is a LDAP Control [RFC4511] whose controlType is 1.3.6.1.1.13.2 and
whose controlValue, an OCTET STRING, contains a BER encoded AttributeSelection [RFC4511], as extended by [RFC3673].
The criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.
This control is appropriate for the addRequest, modifyRequest, and modDNRequest LDAP messages.
The corresponding response control is a LDAP Control whose controlType is 1.3.6.1.1.13.2 and whose controlValue is a BER encoded SearchResultEntry.
The criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.
This control is appropriate for the addResponse, modifyResponse, and modDNResponse LDAP messages with a resultCode of success (0).
When the request control is attached to an appropriate update LDAP request, the control requests the return of a copy of the target entry after the application of the update.
The AttributeSelection indicates, as discussed in [RFC4511][RFC3673], which attributes are requested to appear in the copy.
The server is to return a SearchResultEntry containing, subject to access controls and other constraints, values of the requested attributes.
The normal processing of the update operation and the processing of this control MUST be performed as one atomic action isolated from other update operations.
If the update operation fails (in either normal or control processing), no Post Read response control is provided.
The Pre Read and Post Read controls may be combined with each other and/or with a variety of other controls.
When combined with the assertion control [RFC4528] and/or the manageDsaIT control [RFC3296], the semantics of each control included in the combination applies.
The Pre Read and Post Read controls may be combined with other controls as detailed in other technical specifications.
The controls defined in this document extend update operations to support read capabilities.
Servers MUST ensure that the client is authorized for reading of the information provided in this control and that the client is authorized to perform the requested directory update.
Security considerations for the update operations [RFC4511] extended by this control, as well as general LDAP security considerations [RFC4510], generally apply to implementation and use of this extension 6.
