- title: STATUS OF THIS MEMO
  contents:
  - "STATUS OF THIS MEMO\n   This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community.\
    \ Hosts\n   and gateways on the DARPA Internet that choose to implement a remote\n\
    \   statistics monitoring facility may use this protocol to send\n   statistics\
    \ data upon request to a monitoring center or debugging\n   host.  Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: DISCUSSION
  contents:
  - "DISCUSSION\n   Many host and gateway implementations include a facility which\n\
    \   records traffic statistics, such as packet counters, error counters\n   and\
    \ significant event counters for debugging and performance\n   evluation.  Simple\
    \ data-access and formatting programs can be used to\n   display these statistics\
    \ along with the status of connections, etc.\n   Several operating systems, including\
    \ the various Unix systems and\n   Fuzzball systems, already provide extensive\
    \ facilities to capture and\n   display these data for local users and/or operators.\n\
    \   In many instances it is highly useful to observe statistics data on\n   remote\
    \ hosts and gateways from a monitoring center or debugging host.\n   Indeed, several\
    \ protocols have been implemented and used expressly\n   for this purpose [1-6].\
    \ In many cases the data can be retrieved using\n   conventional services such\
    \ as remote login or even file transfer.\n   However, use of these heavyweight\
    \ mechanisms is awkward and intrusive\n   if conducted on a regular, frequent\
    \ basis and may involve substantial\n   intrusion in the operating system if retrofitted\
    \ to existing systems.\n   The Statistics Server (STATSRV) protocol is intended\
    \ as a lightweight\n   mechanism similar in spirit to NETSTAT [7] and complementary\
    \ to it.\n   STATSRV is designed to capture statistics data with minimal intrusion\n\
    \   on existing systems or networks. It is intended for use with existing\n  \
    \ hosts and gateways primarily for casual monitoring and debugging\n   purposes.\
    \ It is not intended as a full-function monitoring protocol\n   [1,5,6] providing\
    \ detailed, standardized reports suitable for machine\n   analysis, for example,\
    \ but could be useful in exploratory development\n   leading to enduring systems\
    \ of this type.\n   The STATSRV model is based on the native host command language\
    \ used\n   for statistics monitoring and display. The client sends a null-\n \
    \  terminated ASCII command to the server, which then responds with a\n   null-terminated\
    \ ASCII response suitable for a printer or CRT display.\n   Although in principle\
    \ STATSRV could be used over TCP, it is less\n   intrusive and more efficient\
    \ to use it over UDP. In the case of UDP,\n   commands and responses must fit\
    \ into a single 576-octet IP datagram.\n   In both UDP and TCP the assigned port\
    \ number is 133 (decimal).\n   As is conventional in other lightweight services\
    \ of this type\n   (NETSTAT, FINGER, etc.), there is no provision for access control\
    \ or\n   authentication in STATSRV. If necessary, each command could include a\n\
    \   password or other mechanism to discourage casual abuse.\n"
- title: EXAMPLE
  contents:
  - "EXAMPLE\n   The Fuzzball system includes many local commands to display internal\n\
    \   data structures, including one that produces the following billboard\n   for\
    \ each network device, in this case \"dm0\" on host \"udel2.udel.edu\":\n    \
    \    Process type: 000027  options: 040000\n        Subnet: DMV  status: 376 \
    \ hello: 15  timeout: 2000\n        Foreign address: [192.5.39.87]  max size:\
    \ 576\n        Input packets      3645    Output packets  3690\n          bad\
    \ format       0       ICMP msgs       0\n          bad checksum     0       Input\
    \ errors    0\n          returned         0       Output errors   0\n        \
    \  dropped          2       No buffer       0\n          HELLO msgs       2286\
    \    Preempted       0\n   The same billboard is returned as a null-terminated\
    \ ASCII string in a\n   UDP datagram by sending the null-terminated ASCII command\
    \ \"dm0\" in a\n   UDP datagram to the host. Similar billboards can be produced\
    \ for most\n   processes in the system. Unix programs and shell scripts have been\n\
    \   built which send commands like these to selected hosts on a periodic\n   basis\
    \ in order to construct a simple, ad-hoc monitoring facility.\n"
