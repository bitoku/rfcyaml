  contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This RFC specifies a standard for the Internet community.\
    \  Authors of\n   RFCs are expected to adopt and implement this standard.  Distribution\n\
    \   of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFCs are distributed online by being stored as public access\
    \ files,\n   and a short message is sent to the distribution list indicating the\n\
    \   availability of the memo.\n   The online files are copied by the interested\
    \ people and printed or\n   displayed at their site on their equipment.  (An RFC\
    \ may also be\n   returned via email in response to an email query.)  This means\
    \ that\n   the format of the online files must meet the constraints of a wide\n\
    \   variety of printing and display equipment.\n"
- title: 2.  Format Rules
  contents:
  - "2.  Format Rules\n   To meet the distribution constraints the following rules\
    \ are\n   established for the two allowed formats for RFCs:  ASCII and\n   PostScript.\n\
    \   The RFC Editor attempts to ensure a consistent RFC style.  To do this\n  \
    \ the RFC Editor may choose reformat the RFC submitted.  It is much\n   easier\
    \ to do this if the submission matches the style of the most\n   recent RFCs.\
    \  Please do look at some recent RFCs and prepare yours in\n   the same style.\n\
    \   You must submit an editable online document to the RFC Editor.  The\n   RFC\
    \ Editor may require minor changes in format or style and will\n   insert the\
    \ actual RFC number.\n   2a.  ASCII Format Rules:\n      The character codes are\
    \ ASCII.\n      Each page must be limited to 58 lines followed by a form feed\
    \ on a\n      line by itself.\n      Each line must be limited to 72 characters\
    \ followed by carriage\n      return and line feed.\n      No overstriking (or\
    \ underlining) is allowed.\n      These \"height\" and \"width\" constraints include\
    \ any headers,\n      footers, page numbers, or left side indenting.\n      Do\
    \ not fill the text with extra spaces to provide a straight right\n      margin.\n\
    \      Do not do hyphenation of words at the right margin.\n      Do not use footnotes.\
    \  If such notes are necessary, put them at\n      the end of a section, or at\
    \ the end of the document.\n      Use single spaced text within a paragraph, and\
    \ one blank line\n      between paragraphs.\n      RFCs in ASCII Format may be\
    \ submitted to the RFC Editor in email\n      messages (or as online files) in\
    \ either the finished publication\n      format or in NROFF.  If you plan to submit\
    \ a document in NROFF,\n      please consult the RFC Editor first.\n   2b.  PostScript\
    \ Format Rules\n   Standard page size is 8 1/2 by 11 inches.\n      Margin of\
    \ 1 inch on all sides (top, bottom, left, and right).\n      Main text should\
    \ have a point size of no less than 10 points with\n      a line spacing of 12\
    \ points.\n      Footnotes and graph notations no smaller than 8 points with a\
    \ line\n      spacing of 9.6 points.\n      Three fonts are acceptable: Helvetica,\
    \ Times Roman and Courier\n      Plus their bold-face and italic versions.  These\
    \ are the three\n      standard fonts on most PostScript printers.\n      Prepare\
    \ diagrams and images based on lowest common denominator\n      PostScript.  Consider\
    \ common PostScript printer functionality and\n      memory requirements.\n  \
    \    The following PostScript commands should not be used:\n      initgraphics,\
    \ erasepage, copypage, grestoreall, initmatrix,\n      initclip, banddevice, framedevice,\
    \ nulldevice and renderbands.\n      These PostScript rules are likely to changed\
    \ and expanded as\n      experience is gained.\n      RFCs in PostScript Format\
    \ may be submitted to the RFC Editor in\n      email messages (or as online files).\
    \  Since PostScript is not\n      editable, an editable source version of the\
    \ document must also be\n      submitted.  If you plan to submit a document in\
    \ PostScript, please\n      consult the RFC Editor first.\n"
- title: 3.  Status Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Status Statement\n   Each RFC must include on its first page the \"Status\
    \ of this Memo\"\n   section which contains a paragraph describing the intention\
    \ of the\n   RFC.  This section is meant to convey the status granted by the RFC\n\
    \   Editor and the Internet Activities Board (IAB).  There are several\n   reasons\
    \ for publishing a memo as an RFC, for example, to make\n   available some information\
    \ for interested people, or to begin or\n   continue a discussion of an interesting\
    \ idea, or to make available\n   the specification of a protocol.\n      The following\
    \ sample paragraphs may be used to satisfy this\n      requirement:\n        \
    \ Proposed Protocol\n            This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the\
    \ Internet\n            community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\n\
    \            improvements.\n         Specification\n            This RFC specifies\
    \ a standard for the Internet community.\n            Hosts on the Internet are\
    \ expected to adopt and implement\n            this standard.\n         Discussion\n\
    \            The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on particular\n  \
    \          problems in the Internet and possible methods of solution.\n      \
    \      No proposed solutions this document are intended as\n            standards\
    \ for the Internet.  Rather, it is hoped that a\n            general consensus\
    \ will emerge as to the appropriate solution\n            to such problems, leading\
    \ eventually to the adoption of\n            standards.\n         Information\n\
    \            This RFC is being distributed to members of the Internet\n      \
    \      community in order to solicit their reactions to the\n            proposals\
    \ contained in it.  While the issues discussed may\n            not be directly\
    \ relevant to the research problems of the\n            Internet, they may be\
    \ interesting to a number of researchers\n            and implementers.\n    \
    \     Status\n            In response to the need for maintenance of current\n\
    \            information about the status and progress of various\n          \
    \  projects in the Internet community, this RFC is issued for\n            the\
    \ benefit of community members.  The information contained\n            in this\
    \ document is accurate as of the date of publication,\n            but is subject\
    \ to change.  Subsequent RFCs will reflect such\n            changes.\n      These\
    \ paragraphs need not be followed word for word, but the\n      general intent\
    \ of the RFC must be made clear.\n"
- title: 4.  Distribution Statement
  contents:
  - "4.  Distribution Statement\n   Each RFC is to also include a \"distribution statement\"\
    .  In general,\n   RFCs have unlimited distribution.  There may be a few cases\
    \ in which\n   it is appropriate to restrict the distribution in some way.\n \
    \  Typically, the distribution statement will simply be the sentence\n   \"Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\" appended to the \"Status of\n   this Memo\" section.\n"
- title: 5.  Author's Address
  contents:
  - "5.  Author's Address\n   Each RFC must have at the very end a section giving\
    \ the author's\n   address, including the name and postal address, the telephone\
    \ number,\n   and the Internet email address.\n"
- title: 6.  Relation to other RFCs
  contents:
  - "6.  Relation to other RFCs\n   Sometimes an RFC adds information on a topic discussed\
    \ in a previous\n   RFC or completely replaces an earlier RFC.  There are two\
    \ terms used\n   for these cases respectively, UPDATES and OBSOLETES.  A document\
    \ that\n   obsoletes an earlier document can stand on its own.  A document that\n\
    \   merely updates an earlier document cannot stand on its own; it is\n   something\
    \ that must be added to or inserted into the existing\n   document, and has limited\
    \ usefulness independently.  The terms\n   SUPERSEDES and REPLACES are no longer\
    \ used.\n   UPDATES\n      To be used as a reference from a new item that cannot\
    \ be used\n      alone (i.e., one that supplements a previous document), to refer\n\
    \      to the previous document.  The newer publication is a part that\n     \
    \ will supplement or be added on to the existing document; e.g., an\n      addendum,\
    \ or separate, extra information that is to be added to\n      the original document.\n\
    \   OBSOLETES\n      To be used to refer to an earlier document that is replaced\
    \ by\n      this document.  This document contains either revised information,\n\
    \      or else all of the same information plus some new information,\n      however\
    \ extensive or brief that new information is; i.e., this\n      document can be\
    \ used alone, without reference to the older\n      document.\n      For example:\n\
    \         On the Assigned Numbers RFCs, the term OBSOLETES should be used\n  \
    \       since the new document actually incorporates new information\n       \
    \  (however brief) into the text of existing information and is\n         more\
    \ up-to-date than the older document, and hence, replaces it\n         and makes\
    \ it OBSOLETE.\n   In lists of RFCs or the RFC-Index (but not on the RFCs themselves),\n\
    \   the following may be used with early documents to point to later\n   documents.\n\
    \   OBSOLETED-BY\n      To be used to refer to the newer document that replaces\
    \ the older\n      document.\n   UPDATED-BY\n      To be used to refer to the\
    \ newer document that adds information to\n      the existing, still useful, document.\n"

  contents:
  - "9.  Obtaining RFCs\n   RFCs can be obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the\
    \ pathname\n   RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT (where \"nnnn\" refers to the number of the RFC).\n\
    \   Login with FTP, username ANONYMOUS and password GUEST.\n   The NIC also provides\
    \ an automatic mail service for those sites which\n   cannot use FTP.  Address\
    \ the request to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and in\n   the subject field of the message\
    \ indicate the RFC number, as in\n   \"Subject: RFC nnnn\".\n   Requests for special\
    \ distribution (for example, hardcopy) should be\n   addressed to either the author\
    \ of the RFC in question, or to\n   NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL.\n   Unless specifically noted\
    \ otherwise on the RFC itself, all RFCs are\n   for unlimited distribution.\n\
    \   The RFCs may also be obtained from other information centers,\n   including\
    \ the CSNET Information Center (INFO@SH.CS.NET), the NSFNET\n   Information Service\
    \ (INFO@NIS.NSF.NET).\n"
