    \   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has a need for\n   administrative\
    \ support functions.  The debate and dialogue of 2003\n   and 2004 has led to\
    \ the belief that the way these functions are\n   provided needs to be changed.\n\
    \   This document gives the recommendation of the Internet Engineering\n   Steering\
    \ Group (IESG) and Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on what\n   the next step\
    \ in that change process should be, and some of the\n   background and reasoning\
    \ behind this recommendation.\n2.  The Process That Produced This Recommendation\n\
    \   During several months in 2004, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)\n   and\
    \ the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) worked together to\n   consider\
    \ several different options for restructuring the Internet\n   Engineering Task\
    \ Force (IETF) administrative functions.  The goal of\n   this effort was to produce\
    \ a recommendation for consideration by and\n   approval of the IETF community.\
    \  The rationale for this effort is\n   described in RFC 3716 [1].  Much background\
    \ work and several detailed\n   proposals for community consideration are provided\
    \ in a report\n   prepared by a consultant titled \"IETF Administrative Support\n\
    \   Functions\" [2].\n   The consultant's report included several possible scenarios\
    \ for\n   administrative restructuring (named scenario A, B, C, and D).  As\n\
    \   discussion took place within the IETF community, it became clear that\n  \
    \ some of the scenarios had features that appeared more promising than\n   others,\
    \ but that we did not have enough of a concrete proposal to\n   crystallize opinions\
    \ into a consensus for action.  Members of the\n   IESG and IAB took on the task\
    \ of working out more complete\n   descriptions of two of the scenarios.  They\
    \ were:\n   o  Scenario C (section 4.4 of the report) describes when\n      \"\
    administrative support functions for the IETF are legally housed\n      in a focused,\
    \ incorporated institution\" with close ties to the\n      Internet Society (ISOC).\
    \  Scenario C is included here as the first\n      appendix.\n   o  A new scenario,\
    \ called Scenario O, that includes features derived\n      from scenarios A and\
    \ B (sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the report),\n      focusing on the formalization\
    \ of the ISOC/IETF relationship while\n      housing administrative support functions\
    \ for the IETF within ISOC.\n      Scenario O is included here as the second appendix.\n\
    \   These descriptions were not intended to close off discussion of other\n  \
    \ scenarios, but to focus discussion on what appeared to be two\n   independent\
    \ loci of support.\n   Both scenarios were presented to the IETF community as\
    \ mail notes\n   (Scenario C [3], Scenario O [4]) sent to the IETF discussion\
    \ list.\n   IETF participants' opinions, while quite divided on the subject,\n\
    \   seemed to indicate a preference for Scenario O as a \"lower risk\n   operation\"\
    , but some participants indicated that they felt unable to\n   give an informed\
    \ opinion, disagreed with the process, or declared the\n   subject out of their\
    \ field of competence.  This discussion garnered\n   perhaps 40 participants who\
    \ contributed on the list.\n   The IETF Chair then requested an informal poll\
    \ of IETF opinion.\n   People interested in participating in the poll were directed\
    \ to a web\n   site where their opinions could be noted, including whether they\n\
    \   wanted to state an opinion or not.  The raw poll results [5] were\n   also\
    \ shared with the community via a mail note to the IETF discussion\n   list.\n\
    \   The poll sparked additional discussion on the list, and not all\n   participants\
    \ agreed with the methodology of the poll.  Taken with the\n   discussion, though,\
    \ the IESG and IAB members believe that there is a\n   stronger indication of\
    \ community support for change based on Scenario\n   O than on other scenarios.\
    \  The IESG and IAB members believe that\n   Scenario O can be a workable basis\
    \ for further progress, even if it\n   is not the first preference for all members.\
    \  Taken together, this\n   has led to the IESG/IAB recommendation given below.\n\
    3.  Recommendation\n   The collective recommendation of the IAB and IESG was presented\
    \ to\n   the IETF community of Friday 8 October 2004 via a mail note [6] sent\n\
    \   to the IETF mailing list:\n      \"IETF folks,\n      The IESG and IAB have\
    \ been considering the input from the IETF\n      community on the next steps\
    \ going forward in IETF administrative\n      restructuring.\n      It appears\
    \ clear to us that the community mostly sees scenario O\n      as the lower-risk\
    \ scenario, and the one that gives us the greatest\n      probability of successfully\
    \ doing what we have to do.\n      Based on this, the IESG and the IAB make the\
    \ following\n      recommendation:\n             We recommend that the IETF pursue\
    \ scenario O, with the\n             understanding that further work is needed\
    \ to define the\n             roles and responsibilities of the IETF, the IAOC\
    \ and the\n             ISOC BoT under this scenario.\n      The \"BCP section\"\
    \ of the scenario O note will be pulled out and\n      published as an internet-draft.\
    \  We'd like to put this description\n      to the IETF community for a formal\
    \ Last Call before the November\n      IETF meeting, if possible.\n      Also,\
    \ as noted in the recommendation above, there are a number of\n      points where\
    \ we need to work out in more detail how the system is\n      going to work -\
    \ who takes decisions, who accepts those decisions,\n      and what conflict resolution\
    \ mechanisms may be necessary, and so\n      on.  The IAB and IESG are drafting\
    \ a document that will describe\n      the finer level of detail as to the respective\
    \ roles and\n      responsibilities of each of the players.  We will publish this\
    \ as\n      an internet-draft shortly.\n      We will continue to work intensely\
    \ on this!\"\n4.  Arguments That Had Particular Weight in the Discussions\n4.1.\
    \  Focusing on Scenarios C and O\n   The IETF list was presented with four scenarios\
    \ in the consultant\n   report [2], which should be read for the full context.\
    \  In slogan\n   form, they might be rendered as\n   o  A: Leave it to ISOC.\n\
    \   o  B: Increase IETF control of ISOC, and use ISOC to do it.\n   o  C: Isolate\
    \ the functions, let ISOC gather money, share control.\n   o  D: Cut the IETF\
    \ off from ISOC and do it ourselves.\n   On the list, there seemed to be very\
    \ few who were comfortable with\n   the idea that \"we\" (for some version of\
    \ \"we\") could \"do it ourselves\"\n   as envisioned in Scenario D.  There was\
    \ also considerable worry about\n   the risk associated with Scenario C, especially\
    \ with regard to\n   financial stability, and that the perceived danger of problems\
    \ would\n   cause sponsors to withhold funding, thus precipitating problems even\n\
    \   if there was no other reason for them.  Scenario C spoke strongly to\n   those\
    \ who worried about a possible conflict of interest between ISOC\n   and the IETF\
    \ community at some future date - \"we don't know what ISOC\n   will turn into\"\
    \ was the capsule summary.\n   Scenario A worried people because it did not seem\
    \ to acknowledge the\n   IETF community's ability to determine if its needs were\
    \ being met and\n   what could be done if they were not.  The phrase \"replace\
    \ existing\n   problematic structures by ISOC\" was perhaps a capsule summary.\n\
    \   However, Scenario B's list of possible mechanisms for involving IETF\n   community\
    \ directly in ISOC's operations was not viewed as acceptable\n   or in balance\
    \ with the full scope of ISOC's activities.  Members of\n   the IAB & IESG developed\
    \ Scenario O, a solution scenario that put the\n   administrative activity within\
    \ ISOC, but aimed to provide a means for\n   the IETF to provide oversight and\
    \ control of that specific activity\n   within ISOC.  Its name is derived from\
    \ the classification of blood\n   types -- \"neither A nor B\".\n   Thus, the\
    \ decision to focus on C and O as \"alternatives to be worked\n   out in detail\"\
    \ was made.\n4.2.  Why We Chose Scenario O\n   Capsule summary: It might be possible\
    \ to make either scenario work.\n   But Scenario O could be made to work faster,\
    \ and less painfully.\n   The ISOC Board of Trustees was significantly worried\
    \ that scenario C\n   would make fundraising more difficult, which would necessarily\
    \ affect\n   its ability to support the IETF.\n   The question of tax status for\
    \ the new corporation was debated at\n   some length on the list; legal counsel\
    \ indicated that a corporation\n   that did the IETF work (Scenario D) would probably\
    \ be easy to get\n   classified as 501(c)(3) (a type of non-profit corporation\
    \ defined by\n   U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations).  However, a\n\
    \   corporation that did only administrative support functions, as\n   scenario\
    \ C envisioned, would have more problems.  In all cases, the\n   process of determining\
    \ this would take months, and could be dragged\n   out longer if we were unlucky.\n\
    \   The community feedback, in addition to contributing many well-formed\n   and\
    \ well-argued points to the discussion, gave a powerful indication\n   on where\
    \ it was possible to get IETF consensus:\n   o  It seemed possible to garner IETF\
    \ consensus around Scenario O; the\n      people arguing for Scenario C indicated\
    \ that they \"could live\n      with\" the alternative.\n   o  It seemed much\
    \ more difficult to garner IETF consensus around\n      Scenario C; many people\
    \ arguing against it indicated that they\n      were firmly convinced that it\
    \ was the wrong choice for the IETF.\n   The IETF is based on the idea that the\
    \ consensus process, when it\n   works, comes up with reasonable decisions.  We\
    \ concluded that the\n   apparent drift of community consensus was a reasonable\
    \ basis for the\n   IESG/IAB recommendations.\n5.  IANA Considerations\n   This\
    \ document does not require any IANA actions.  However, the IETF\n   administrative\
    \ restructuring process is likely to affect how the\n   relationship between the\
    \ IETF and the IANA is managed.\n6.  Security Considerations\n   This document\
    \ does not introduce any security considerations for the\n   operation of the\
    \ Internet.  However, administrative restructuring\n   introduces several areas\
    \ of risk to the future of the IETF.  The\n   risks and their mitigation strategies\
    \ are described in the scenarios\n   as appended to this document.\n7.  Acknowledgements\n\

    C>>\nC>> Abstract\nC>>\nC>>    This document defines a proposal for an IETF Administrative\n\
    C>>    Support Foundation (IASF) as an independent not-for-profit\nC>>    corporation\
    \ as a means for providing focused support for IETF\nC>>    community activities.\
    \ It proposes the creation of an IASF Board\nC>>    of Trustees (BoT) that is\
    \ mainly selected by and accountable to\nC>>    the IETF community and would provide\
    \ oversight for the IETF\nC>>    Administrative Support Foundation. The IASF will\
    \ also establish\nC>>    and maintain a strong relationship with the Internet\
    \ Society\nC>>    (ISOC) and the current relationships between IETF and ISOC will\n\
    C>>    basically be left unchanged.\nC>>\nC>>    In order to allow the community\
    \ to properly evaluate this\nC>>    scenario, some draft Articles of Incorporation\
    \ and draft Bylaws\nC>>    for the IASF are included.  Some draft BCP wording\
    \ for the IASF,\nC>>    IETF and ISOC relationships is also included.\nC>>\nC>>\
    \    1.  Overview of Scenario C\nC>>\nC>>    This document follows from two previous\
    \ documents.  [RFC3716]\nC>>    defined the overall parameters and criteria for\
    \ an administrative\nC>>    restructuring.  [I-D.malamud-consultant-report] provided\
    \ an\nC>>    analysis of the implications of several of the suggested\nC>>   \
    \ strategies.  This document picks one strategy and develops it\nC>>    further.\n\
    C>>\nC>>    In order to provide the most focused and effective administrative\n\
    C>>    support to the IETF community, this updated scenario C proposes a\nC>>\
    \    new and well-defined legal entity to support the IETF\nC>>    administrative\
    \ functions.  The name of that new entity is \"The\nC>>    IETF Administrative\
    \ Support Foundation\" (IASF).\nC>>\nC>>    First, it is important to understand\
    \ that the IETF has been\nC>>    organized as an Activity of the Internet Society\
    \ (ISOC) and as\nC>>    such represents the \"Standards and Protocols\" pillar\
    \ of ISOC.\nC>>    Under this proposal, the IETF would continue to be an integral\n\
    C>>    part of the Standards and Protocols pillar of ISOC.  ISOC\nC>>    currently\
    \ provides these important functions to the IETF:\nC>>\nC>>    1.  Standards Process\
    \ Functions. ISOC plays a fundamental role in\nC>>        the IETF Standards Process,\
    \ including appointment of the\nC>>        Nominating Committee (Nomcom) chair,\
    \ confirmation of IAB\nC>>        members, confirmation of documents that describe\
    \ the\nC>>        standards processes, and acting as the last resort in the\n\
    C>>        appeals process.  These Standards Process Functions are\nC>>      \
    \  defined in [RFC2026], [RFC2028], [RFC2031], and [RFC3677].\nC>>\nC>>    2.\
    \  IETF Fund Raising Functions. ISOC provides the fund raising\nC>>        function\
    \ as one source for financial support the IETF.\nC>>\nC>>    3.  Administration\
    \ Functions. ISOC provides administrative and\nC>>        financial functions,\
    \ managing the contract with the RFC\nC>>        Editor, providing insurance for\
    \ selected IETF participants,\nC>>        and administering a discretionary fund\
    \ for use by the IAB and\nC>>        the IETF Chairs.\nC>>\nC>>    The administrative\
    \ restructuring of the IETF proposed in this\nC>>    document keeps that basic\
    \ relationship between IETF and ISOC.\nC>>    Specifically, the recommendation\
    \ does not propose any changes to\nC>>    the \"Standards Process Functions\"\
    \ or to the \"IETF Fund Raising\nC>>    Functions\".\nC>>\nC>>    Under the \"\
    Administration Functions\", ISOC both funds and\nC>>    administers some (as stated\
    \ above) parts of the IETF\nC>>    Administrative Support Functions.  Some of\
    \ the funds (like for\nC>>    the RFC-Editor) go directly to the contractor who\
    \ executes the\nC>>    administrative function.  The streamlining of the administrative\n\
    C>>    support for the IETF ultimately intends to put the complete\nC>>    Administrative\
    \ Support Functions under the newly recommended\nC>>    IASF.  This means that\
    \ we recommend that ultimately, ISOC funds\nC>>    for the IETF will be transferred\
    \ to the IASF, which will then\nC>>    administer all the contracts and payments\
    \ according to an\nC>>    approved yearly budget.  The details of that process\
    \ will be\nC>>    documented in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between ISOC,\n\
    C>>    IETF and IASF.\nC>>\nC>>    This updated AdminRest Scenario C aims to provide\
    \ the following:\nC>>\nC>>    o  A continued close relationship between IETF and\
    \ ISOC.\nC>>\nC>>    o  A well defined legal entity within which the IETF can\
    \ define\nC>>       the administrative activity in terms of IETF community needs.\n\
    C>>\nC>>    o  A Board of Trustees with operational oversight that is\nC>>   \
    \    accountable to the IETF community.\nC>>\nC>>    o  Continued separation between\
    \ the IETF standards activity and\nC>>       any fund-raising for standards work.\n\
    C>>\nC>>    o  A close and well defined relationship between IASF and ISOC,\n\
    C>>       documented in a BCP (or MoU).\nC>>\nC>>    o  Appropriate ISOC oversight\
    \ of its standards activities funds\nC>>       via a yearly budget approval and\
    \ open reporting of funds\nC>>       spent.\nC>>\nC>>    In scenario C, it is\
    \ intended that the IETF Administrative\nC>>    Support Foundation will be a tax-exempt\
    \ not-for-profit\nC>>    corporation as defined by Articles of Incorporation and\
    \ a set of\nC>>    Bylaws.  These will describe the scope and purpose of the IASF\n\
    C>>    and they also define the structure and responsibility of the\nC>>    Board\
    \ of Trustees (BoT), a body that is mainly selected by the\nC>>    IETF and which\
    \ is responsible for overseeing the IASF.  A draft\nC>>    of the Articles of\
    \ Incorporation and Bylaws is included in the\nC>>    next sections of this document.\n\
    C>>\nC>>    Scenario C allows us (IETF) to establish IETF control over our\nC>>\
    \    administrative support functions in terms of determining that\nC>>    they\
    \ meet the community's needs, and adjusting them from time to\nC>>    time using\
    \ IETF processes.  This is to address the pressing\nC>>    administrative issues\
    \ outlined in [RFC3716].\nC>>\nC>>    Scenario C also encourages us (the IETF)\
    \ to regularly evaluate\nC>>    that we do want to continue the relationships\
    \ with ISOC and the\nC>>    contracts with our services providers (contractors).\
    \  It is based\nC>>    on the premise that we prefer to actively maintain relationships\n\
    C>>    with other organizations and service providers instead of being\nC>>  \
    \  bound to such relationships based on poorly defined and poorly\nC>>    documented\
    \ historical facts.  A draft BCP for the relationship\nC>>    between ISOC, IETF\
    \ and IASF is included as a separate section in\nC>>    this document.\nC>>\n\
    C>>    Scenario C does however bring the burden of creating a new legal\nC>> \
    \   entity (IASF) and such an undertaking is also not without risks.\nC>>    It\
    \ will need careful planning and execution.  Migration from the\nC>>    current\
    \ structure to this new structure is probably also somewhat\nC>>    more costly\
    \ and time and labour consuming.  The sections below\nC>>    try to show how that\
    \ would be achieved and outlines what further\nC>>    steps are needed to provide\
    \ more detail if this scenario is\nC>>    chosen.\nC>>\nC>> 2.  Work Plan for\
    \ the IETF Administrative Support Foundation\nC>>\nC>>    This section gives the\
    \ work plan for the IETF Administrative\nC>>    Support Foundation (IASF) for\
    \ the remainder of 2004 and the year\nC>>    2005.\nC>>\nC>> 2.1  Workplan goals\n\
    C>>\nC>>    The work plan below is intended to satisfy three goals:\nC>>\nC>>\
    \    o  Satisfy the IETF's need for support functions in 2005\nC>>\nC>>    o \
    \ Operate with a positive account balance throughout 2005\nC>>\nC>>    o  Start\
    \ building up a fund inside the IASF to serve as a buffer\nC>>       against budgetary\
    \ emergencies in later years (such as meetings\nC>>       with a severe cost overrun,\
    \ or force-majeure cancellations).\nC>>\nC>>    The fund target is 6 months of\
    \ operating revenue, and the target\nC>>    for building up the fund is 3 years.\
    \  The budgeted set-aside for\nC>>    the fund should thus be approximately 17%\
    \ of operating revenue.\nC>>\nC>> 2.2  Incorporation process\nC>>\nC>>    There\
    \ are 3 things that need to be in place before that\nC>>    corporation can be\
    \ considered viable at all:\nC>>\nC>>    o  IETF consensus on the plan\nC>>\n\
    C>>    o  ISOC agreement on a reasonable support contract\nC>>\nC>>    o  Assurance\
    \ that the corporation will have tax-exempt status\nC>>\nC>>    Once this document\
    \ has been discussed in the IETF, and the IESG\nC>>    and IAB gauges that rough\
    \ consensus seems reached, the IETF\nC>>    leadership will take the following\
    \ actions:\nC>>\nC>>    o  Publish a Last Call on this document (to determine\
    \ plan\nC>>       consensus).\nC>>\nC>>    o  Choose a negotiating team to negotiate\
    \ the ISOC contract.\nC>>\nC>>    o  Choose an executive search team to find the\
    \ IASF\nC>>       Administrative Director (IAD).\nC>>\nC>>    o  Consult with\
    \ legal counsel to determine how best to achieve\nC>>       tax-exempt status;\
    \ this will affect the bylaws and articles of\nC>>       incorporation.\nC>>\n\
    C>>    When the Last Call is over, the IESG will consider whether there\nC>> \
    \   is still consensus, and if there is, approve this document for\nC>>    publication.\
    \  Once that happens, it will take the following\nC>>    steps:\nC>>\nC>>    o\
    \  As soon as negotiations conclude, publish a Last Call on the\nC>>       ISOC\
    \ contract.\nC>>\nC>>    o  As soon as drafting of legal documents is completed,\
    \ publish a\nC>>       Last Call on the Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation,\
    \ and ask\nC>>       the Nomcom to start the process of selecting Nomcom-selected\n\
    C>>       board representatives.\nC>>\nC>>\nC>>    These Last Calls are \"speak\
    \ now\" Last Calls - if someone wishes\nC>>    to challenge the IETF consensus\
    \ to go ahead with these actions,\nC>>    knowing what the formal documents will\
    \ look like, this is their\nC>>    last chance.\nC>>\nC>>    When these Last Calls\
    \ are over, the IETF chair, the IAB chair and\nC>>    the ISOC President will\
    \ jointly file the articles of\nC>>    incorporation, and the IESG, IAB and ISOC\
    \ will fill their board\nC>>    seats.\nC>>\nC>>    Note: This document does not\
    \ say when a Request for Information\nC>>    (RFI) for IETF support services such\
    \ as meeting planning is sent\nC>>    out. Advice is sought on the earliest point\
    \ where this can be\nC>>    done.\nC>>\nC>> 2.3  Contract establishment\nC>>\n\
    C>>    The most important activity for late 2004/early 2005 is to\nC>>    finalize\
    \ contracts for the support of the IETF.  This includes:\nC>>\nC>>    o  Funding\n\
    C>>\nC>>    o  Technical infrastructure\nC>>\nC>>    o  Meeting management\nC>>\n\
    C>>    o  Clerk's office\nC>>\nC>>    o  RFC Editor\nC>>\nC>>    o  IANA\nC>>\n\
    C>>    There appears to be consensus in the IETF community that these\nC>>   \
    \ functions, whether they are offered for free, remunerated or\nC>>    arranged\
    \ for other consideration, should be under contract.\nC>>\nC>>    The contract\
    \ for funding is expected to be with ISOC, and should\nC>>    be finalized before\
    \ IASF is established.\nC>>\nC>>    The contract for technical infrastructure\
    \ is expected to be an\nC>>    RFP, published in November of 2004, with responses\
    \ being\nC>>    evaluated in December 2004, and services rendered from a mutually\n\
    C>>    agreed date early in 2005.\nC>>\nC>>    The contract for meeting management\
    \ will be influenced by the\nC>>    need to have stable agreements for the 2005\
    \ meetings at an early\nC>>    date.  This indicates that IASF will honor a pre-IASF\
    \ agreement\nC>>    to have these meeting contracts signed by Foretec (if that\
    \ can be\nC>>    achieved).\nC>>\nC>>    It is not clear how the contract for\
    \ the clerk's office is to be\nC>>    managed at the time of this writing.\nC>>\n\
    C>>    The contract for the RFC Editor is expected to be with ISI, and\nC>>  \
    \  is expected to be a continuation of the current contract with\nC>>    ISOC,\
    \ which runs until the end of 2005.\nC>>\nC>>    The contract with IANA will replace\
    \ or augment the current MoU\nC>>    between the IETF and ICANN.  In its simplest\
    \ form, it would\nC>>    simply be a reconfirmation of the duties of ICANN under\
    \ the MoU.\nC>>\nC>> 2.4  Performance evaluation\nC>>\nC>>    The second task\
    \ of the IASF is to make sure the IETF gets the\nC>>    support it needs.  The\
    \ IASF will work together with the IETF\nC>>    community to make an effort to\
    \ identify whether or not the IETF's\nC>>    needs are being met, and to coordinate\
    \ improvements with the\nC>>    contractors.  This is an ongoing activity.\nC>>\n\
    C>> 2.5  Budgeting for 2006\nC>>\nC>>    In June 2005, the IASF will start the\
    \ yearly budgeting process\nC>>    with ISOC, as specified in the ISOC contract,\
    \ leading to a work\nC>>    plan and budget for 2006.\nC>>\nC>> 2.6  Reporting\n\
    C>>\nC>>    The IASF will present monthly updates on its economic status.\nC>>\
    \    These will be delivered to ISOC as part of the ISOC contract, and\nC>>  \
    \  also be made publicly available so that the IETF community can\nC>>    inspect\
    \ them.\nC>>\nC>> 3.  Details of the IETF Administrative Support Foundation\n\
    C>>\nC>>    This section contains details about the proposal to change how\nC>>\
    \    the day-to-day IETF administrative support functions are\nC>>    provided.\
    \  This recommendation is based on the  initial\nC>>    description of \"Scenario\
    \ C\" in the \"Administrative Support\nC>>    Analysis\" [I-D.malamud-consultant-report]\
    \ provided by Carl\nC>>    Malamud.  It is further based on discussion in the\
    \ IESG and IAB\nC>>    and on feedback on Carl's document as received on the IETF\n\
    C>>    mailing list.  Further justifications, reasoning and motivations\nC>> \
    \   are given in Appendix A. Risk Analysis is done in Appendix C.\nC>>\nC>>  \
    \  This document recommends to create a well defined and legal\nC>>    entity\
    \ called \"The IETF Administrative Support Foundation\"\nC>>\nC>>    (IASF). \
    \ The name intends to clearly express that this new legal\nC>>    entity has only\
    \ one single function, namely to provide the\nC>>    administrative support of\
    \ the IETF Standardization and Protocol\nC>>    Development activities.  This\
    \ entity will ultimately manage and\nC>>    administer all the administrative\
    \ functions that are needed to\nC>>    support the IETF - the Standardization\
    \ and Protocol Development\nC>>    activity of ISOC.\nC>>\nC>> 3.1  Organizational\
    \ Form and Legal Domicile\nC>>\nC>>    The consultant report [I-D.malamud-consultant-report]\
    \ contains a\nC>>    writeup on various choices in terms of how and where to\n\
    C>>    incorporate. This recommendation has made the choice to\nC>>    incorporate\
    \ in the US in the state of Virginia.  Some detail can\nC>>    be found in Appendix\
    \ B.\nC>>\nC>>    In this scenario, administrative support functions for the IETF\n\
    C>>    are legally housed in a focused, incorporated institution\nC>>    (although\
    \ the Administrative Director might be physically housed\nC>>    within the Internet\
    \ Society).\nC>>\nC>>    This scenario defines a number of concrete linkages with\
    \ the\nC>>    Internet Society, which supplement the current close\nC>>    interconnection\
    \ of the IETF community with ISOC.  The\nC>>    relationship is to be documented\
    \ in a MoU (initial text is in\nC>>    Section 4).\nC>>\nC>> 3.2  Draft Core Principles\n\
    C>>\nC>> 3.2.1  Principles of Establishment and Governance\nC>>\nC>>    The following\
    \ principles are to be respected for the\nC>>    establishment and governance\
    \ of the IETF Administrative Support\nC>>    Foundation (IASF) and are the basis\
    \ for the Draft Articles of\nC>>    Incorporation as in Section 6.1 and the Draft\
    \ Bylaws as in\nC>>    Section 6.2:\nC>>\nC>>    1.  The IASF shall be governed\
    \ by a Board of Trustees (BoT), who\nC>>        shall be responsible for the fiscal,\
    \ legal, and\nC>>        administrative infrastructure that supports the activities\
    \ of\nC>>        the IETF.\nC>>\nC>>    2.  The governance of the IETF, the standards\
    \ process, and all\nC>>        other aspects of how we make our standards are\
    \ defined in the\nC>>        procedural Best Current Practice (BCP) RFC series,\
    \ which will\nC>>        be explicitly referenced in the organization documents\
    \ of the\nC>>        IASF.\nC>>\nC>>    3.  The IASF shall be transparent and\
    \ responsible to the IETF.\nC>>\nC>>    4.  The BoT shall appoint a Secretary\
    \ and a Treasurer, who need\nC>>        not be members of the BoT.  The IETF Administrative\
    \ Director\nC>>        (IAD) of the IASF shall provide staff support to the BoT.\n\
    C>>\nC>>    5.  The BoT shall be composed to strike a balance between\nC>>   \
    \     \"outside\" and \"inside\" directors.  The IESG and IAB will each\nC>> \
    \       select a representative to serve as a voting member of the\nC>>      \
    \  BoT. Mechanisms such as the Nominating Committee (Nomcom) and\nC>>        the\
    \ appointment of certain seats by the ISOC fulfill the\nC>>        outside director\
    \ obligations.\nC>>\nC>>    6.  IAB, IESG and ISOC will have liaisons to the BoT\
    \ in order to\nC>>        have a good basis for interaction.\nC>>\nC>>    The\
    \ BoT will have strong governance over a limited scope of\nC>>    activities (e.g.,\
    \ the fiscal, legal, and administrative\nC>>    infrastructure that are the charter\
    \ of the IASF) but will have no\nC>>    authority over the IETF standards process.\
    \  In this board\nC>>    composition, the ISOC and Nomcom appointments ensure\
    \ that outside\nC>>    directors with no perceived conflicts of interest are on\
    \ the\nC>>    board.\nC>>\nC>>    All nominating bodies should make strong fiscal,\
    \ legal, and\nC>>    administrative acumen essential selection criteria for this\n\
    C>>    position.\nC>>\nC>>    IAB and IESG representatives will serve for one\
    \ year.  For other\nC>>    appointments, a term proposed for the nominated positions\
    \ is\nC>>    three years with staggered appointments.  However, the nominating\n\
    C>>    body might have the power to change their appointee during their\nC>> \
    \   term.\nC>>\nC>>    All members of the BoT selected by the IETF are subject\
    \ to the\nC>>    same recall procedures in effect for the IETF leadership such\
    \ as\nC>>    members of the IAB and IESG.\nC>>\nC>> 3.2.2  Principles of Operation\
    \ of the IETF Administrative Support\nC>>       Foundation\nC>>\nC>>    The following\
    \ are general principles for the operation of the\nC>>    IASF:\nC>>\nC>>    1.\
    \  The IASF shall employ an IETF Administrative Director (IAD)\nC>>        of\
    \ the IASF, who shall be hired by the BoT with the advice\nC>>        and consent\
    \ of the IESG and IAB.\nC>>\nC>>    2.  All support services shall be contracted\
    \ in an open and\nC>>        transparent manner.\nC>>\nC>>    3.  The IAD shall\
    \ submit a proposed annual budget to the BoT at\nC>>        least 90 days before\
    \ the beginning of the fiscal year.  Such\nC>>        budget shall be developed\
    \ with the advice and consent of the\nC>>        IAB and IESG.\nC>>\nC>>    4.\
    \  The IAD shall serve on the BoT as a non-voting, ex-officio\nC>>        member.\n\
    C>>\nC>>    5.  The BoT shall select a professional audit firm and shall\nC>>\
    \        commission an audit immediately upon the close of each fiscal\nC>>  \
    \      year.\nC>>\nC>>    6.  The IASF will conduct financial reporting in a fully\n\
    C>>        transparent fashion.  Audits shall be conducted promptly and\nC>> \
    \       published.  Tax returns shall be published.  Detailed\nC>>        financial\
    \ statements will be published on a regular basis,\nC>>        including timely\
    \ reports on the financial results of IETF\nC>>        meetings.\nC>>\nC>> 4.\
    \  Draft MoU between ISOC, IETF and IETF Administrative Support\nC>>    Foundation\n\
    C>>\nC>> 4.1  Form and Scope of the Agreement\nC>>\nC>>    This section presents\
    \ some principles to be incorporated in a\nC>>    draft MoU/Contract between the\
    \ Internet Society (ISOC) and the\nC>>    IETF Administrative Support Foundation\
    \ (IASF), detailing the work\nC>>    each is expected to perform, the responsibilities\
    \ each has, and\nC>>    the means by which these functions are accomplished. \
    \ This\nC>>    MoU/Contract shall be published as an RFC.\nC>>\nC>>    The MoU/Contract\
    \ will specify the responsibilities of the\nC>>    Internet Society, including:\n\
    C>>\nC>>    o  Reaffirmation of the Standards Process Function that ISOC\nC>>\
    \       performs for the IETF.\nC>>\nC>>    o  Continuation of the Fund Raising\
    \ Function that ISOC conducts,\nC>>       in which a single, unified campaign\
    \ is used to solicit\nC>>       corporate, individual,  and other organizational\
    \ donations for\nC>>       funding of the 3 Pillars.\nC>>\nC>>    o  Disbursement\
    \ of funds to the IASF according to the agreed-upon\nC>>       budgets and processes\
    \ as specified in this agreement.\nC>>\nC>>    o  Verification that IASF spends\
    \ these funds to support the work\nC>>       of the IETF, within the scope described\
    \ in the IASF bylaws.\nC>>\nC>>    Responsibilities of IASF:\nC>>\nC>>    o  Determine,\
    \ in cooperation with the IETF, the support functions\nC>>       that are needed\
    \ for the IETF, and can be achieved within\nC>>       available funds.\nC>>\n\
    C>>    o  Enter into contracts for these support functions.\nC>>\nC>>    o  Supervise\
    \ these contracts and ensure that they are being\nC>>       performed in the best\
    \ interest of the IETF, within a\nC>>       reasonable budget and with agreed-upon\
    \ performance.\nC>>\nC>> 4.2  Cooperation mechanism\nC>>\nC>>    IASF and ISOC\
    \ agree that they will perform a budgeting procedure\nC>>    each year, comprising\
    \ the following steps:\nC>>\nC>>    o  IASF puts together a budget proposal to\
    \ ISOC, and presents it\nC>>       in June.  This will specify the functions that\
    \ need to be\nC>>       performed, the cost of each, the expected revenue from\
    \ IETF\nC>>       meeting participation, and how much is being requested for\n\
    C>>       ISOC to contribute.\nC>>\nC>>    o  By the end of August, ISOC will\
    \ give a budget number to IASF\nC>>       that says how much ISOC is willing to\
    \ contribute to support\nC>>       the functions described in the IASF budget.\n\
    C>>\nC>>    o  Before November 1, ISOC and IASF will agree on a budget, an\nC>>\
    \       ISOC contribution, and a disbursement schedule.\nC>>\nC>>    o  If either\
    \ party sees that there is reason to change the\nC>>       budget, they can start\
    \ a negotiation to do so at any time.  On\nC>>       mutual agreement to a change,\
    \ payments are modified\nC>>       accordingly.\nC>>\nC>>    o  ISOC may withhold\
    \ funds if IASF fails to account for its\nC>>       expenditures, if it determines\
    \ that IASF has departed\nC>>       significantly from its budgeted expenditures\
    \ without agreement\nC>>       with ISOC to do so, or if ISOC determines that\
    \ IASF is\nC>>       spending funds in violation of its bylaws.\nC>>\nC>> 4.3\
    \  Promises Not to Do Things\nC>>\nC>>    This section lays out things that would\
    \ constitute interference\nC>>    in each others' business, or things that are\
    \ Just Plain Wrong.\nC>>\nC>>    In legal terms, these are called \"covenants.\"\
    \nC>>\nC>>    ISOC will not place requirements on how IASF does business,\nC>>\
    \    except on reporting.  It will, for instance, not attempt to\nC>>    influence\
    \ IASF choice of contractors or choice of meeting\nC>>    sponsors.  This restriction\
    \ is meant to enforce the separation\nC>>    between fund raising and the actual\
    \ operation of the standards\nC>>    process.\nC>>\nC>>    IASF will not ask companies\
    \ for money.  IASF may ask for sponsors\nC>>    for IETF events, per tradition,\
    \ and may accept zero-cost provider\nC>>    contracts or in-kind donations, but\
    \ ISOC is the organization\nC>>    charged with fundraising.\nC>>\nC>>    Neither\
    \ ISOC nor IASF will attempt to influence technical\nC>>    decisions of the IETF\
    \ standards process.\nC>>\nC>> 4.4  Initial contribution\nC>>\nC>>    The Internet\
    \ Society has already allocated $700,000 in transition\nC>>    funds.  As part\
    \ of the formation process, this section sets out a\nC>>    way that a 2005 allocation\
    \ of funds and an initial contribution\nC>>    for startup can be decided upon.\
    \  NOTE: This section is a GUESS!\nC>>    Its purpose is to give some sense of\
    \ where we're at.\nC>>\nC>>    If this plan is pursued, one of the first activities\
    \ is to put\nC>>    together a detailed 2005 budget, including an analysis of\
    \ cash\nC>>    flow and balance sheets to make sure that the organization is\n\
    C>>    properly funded and will be solvent throughout the year.  This\nC>>   \
    \ planning process should project out 3 years and show how the\nC>>    organization\
    \ will be able to accumulate the appropriate cash\nC>>    reserve to make sure\
    \ operations can continue in a stable manner.\nC>>\nC>>    An initial estimate\
    \ is for an on-going annual contribution of USD\nC>>    900.000 to IASF in 2005.\
    \  In addition, ISOC will contribute an\nC>>    additional USD 600.000 as an initial\
    \ fund to start up IASF,\nC>>    payable after the Board of Trustees is seated\
    \ and this contract\nC>>    is signed and approved by the IETF.\nC>>\nC>>    ISOC\
    \ commits to this ongoing level of contribution (USD 75.000\nC>>    per month)\
    \ for the lifetime of this contract, unless modified by\nC>>    mutual agreement.\n\
    C>>\nC>> 4.5  Termination, law and so on\nC>>\nC>>    This agreement may be terminated\
    \ by either party for any reason\nC>>    on 12 months' notice.\nC>>\nC>>    The\
    \ parties may reach mutual agreement on a shorter termination\nC>>    period.\n\
    C>>\nC>>    All conflicts under this agreement are to be adjudicated under\nC>>\
    \    the laws of the United States and the State of Virginia, however\nC>>   \
    \ the parties may also agree to arbitration, mediation or any other\nC>>    conflict\
    \ resolution mechanisms.\nC>>\nC>> 5.  Notes and Explanations\nC>>\nC>>    This\
    \ is where we put down why things are the way they are.\nC>>\nC>> 5.1  Type of\
    \ legal instrument\nC>>\nC>>    This document is styled as a contract - an agreement\
    \ between two\nC>>    parties, enforceable under law.  An alternate formulation\
    \ would\nC>>    be a Memorandum of Understanding - but we want it to be clear\
    \ to\nC>>    everyone that the parties stand behind their responsibilities\nC>>\
    \    under this document.  At the moment, the authors see no\nC>>    compelling\
    \ arguments for not making it a contract.  In either\nC>>    case, the document\
    \ is published as an RFC.\nC>>\nC>> 5.2  Power Balance\nC>>\nC>>    As written,\
    \ it is designed to make it easy to do the right thing\nC>>    as long as the\
    \ parties agree what that is, to make it clear that\nC>>    ISOC will continue\
    \ to pay money as long as IASF does the Right\nC>>    Thing (and reports what\
    \ it's doing), and that ISOC can stop the\nC>>    show quickly if it's clear that\
    \ IASF is not doing the Right\nC>>    Thing.\nC>>\nC>> 5.3  Budget figures\nC>>\n\
    C>>    The main purpose of the numbers is to make it clear that there\nC>>   \
    \ WILL be numbers in this contract, and that it WILL represent a\nC>>    solid\
    \ commitment by ISOC.  The numbers are \"subject to change\nC>>    without notice\"\
    \ while this contract is negotiated.\nC>>\nC>> 6.  Draft Incorporating Documents\

    \ Board of Trustees may be taken without a meeting if all\nC>>\nC>>        Trustees\

    \ by written consents approving the lack of\nC>>        a meeting, signed by each\
    \ Trustee.\nC>>\nC>>    *Section 8: Board Committees.* The Trustees may elect\
    \ or appoint\nC>>    one or more committees (including but not limited to an Executive\n\
    C>>    Committee) and may delegate to any such committee or committees\nC>>  \
    \  any or all of their powers, provided that any committee to which\nC>>    the\

    \  Committees shall conduct their affairs in the same\nC>>    manner as is provided\
    \ in these By Laws for the Trustees.  The\nC>>    members of any committee shall\

    \    *Section 9: Trustee Member Conflict of Interest.*\nC>>\nC>>    1.  As set\
    \ forth in Section 9(3) below, a Trustee of the IETF\nC>>        Administrative\
    \ Support Foundation (IASF) who has a personal\nC>>        interest in a transaction,\
    \ as defined below, may not\nC>>        participate in any discussion of that\
    \ transaction by the\nC>>        Trustees of The IASF and may not vote to determine\
    \ whether to\nC>>        authorize, approve, or ratify that transaction except\
    \ as\nC>>        specifically described below. For purposes of these Bylaws, a\n\
    C>>        \"personal interest\" is defined as any act that will provide,\nC>>\
    \        directly or indirectly, a financial benefit or a disparate\nC>>     \
    \   benefit individually to the Trustee, or to a company he or\nC>>        she\
    \ is employed by, has a significant financial interest in,\nC>>        or represents\
    \ in any fashion.  However, policies under\nC>>        consideration by the IASF\
    \ are likely to have an impact on the\nC>>        business of every Trustee. \
    \ It is expected that most policy\nC>>        decisions will have a direct or\
    \ indirect impact on the\nC>>        Trustee's company, but such a non-individualized\
    \ interest\nC>>        does not constitute a \"personal interest\" as used in\
    \ these\nC>>        Bylaws.  A \"transaction\" with The IASF for purposes of these\n\
    C>>        Bylaws is a contract or consultancy in which the Trustee has\nC>> \
    \       a direct or indirect financial benefit, or a policy under\nC>>       \
    \ consideration that will have a disparate and unusual impact\nC>>        on a\
    \ business with which the Trustee is directly or\nC>>        indirectly associated.\n\
    C>>\nC>>    2.  The mere existence of a personal interest by a Trustee of The\n\
    C>>        IASF in a transaction with the IASF shall not invalidate the\nC>> \
    \       IASF's ability to enter that transaction so long as the\nC>>        following\
    \ conditions are met: (i) the material facts of the\nC>>        personal nature\
    \ of the transaction with The IASF and the\nC>>        Trustee's interest in the\
    \ transaction with the IASF are fully\nC>>        disclosed to the Board of Trustees\
    \ of the IASF, either by the\nC>>        Trustee having a direct or indirect personal\
    \ interest in the\nC>>\nC>>        transaction with the IASF, or are brought to\
    \ the attention of\nC>>        the Board by a third party; or (ii) the BoT of\
    \ the IASF, by a\nC>>        vote of the Trustees (without a conflict of interest)\
    \ of the\nC>>        IASF vote to authorize, approve, or ratify a transaction\
    \ with\nC>>        the IASF; or (iii) the transaction with the IASF in which the\n\
    C>>        direct or indirect personal interest of a IASF Trustee was\nC>>   \
    \     disclosed to the BoT of The IASF and was determined by the\nC>>        BoT\
    \ of the IASF entitled to vote on the matter is determined\nC>>        by the\
    \ BoT voting to be in the IASF's interests,\nC>>        notwithstanding the personal\
    \ interest of the non-voting\nC>>        Trustee.\nC>>\nC>>    3.  In determining\
    \ whether a conflict of interest exists, the BoT\nC>>        of the IASF has the\
    \ prerogative, upon review of all facts and\nC>>        circumstances, to make\
    \ its own determination of whether a\nC>>        conflict of interest exists and\
    \ how it is appropriate to\nC>>        proceed. A Trustee who perceives the possibility\
    \ of a\nC>>        conflict of interest for him or herself, or for another Board\n\
    C>>        member, may raise this issue at any point prior to a vote on\nC>> \
    \       any issue.  Any Trustee who perceives a possible conflict of\nC>>    \
    \    interest may present justification with respect to whether or\nC>>      \
    \  not a conflict of interest exists, but the entire Board, with\nC>>        the\
    \ exception of the Trustee having the potential conflict of\nC>>        interest,\
    \ shall make the final determination to proceed in\nC>>        such a matter.\
    \  If the BoT finds there is a conflict of\nC>>        interest, the Trustee with\
    \ the conflict may be excluded by\nC>>        the Chair of the Board from that\
    \ portion of any meeting where\nC>>        a substantive discussion or decision\
    \ to engage or not in such\nC>>        a transaction is made, except that he or\
    \ she may provide any\nC>>        information that will assist the Trustees in\
    \ such a matter\nC>>        before leaving such a meeting.\nC>>\nC>>    *Section\
    \ 10.  Approval of Meeting Minutes.* Minutes of the BoT of\nC>>    the IASF must\
    \ be approved by a procedure adopted by the board and\nC>>    published on the\
    \ IASF web site.\nC>>\nC>> 6.2.6  Article VI: Officers\nC>>\nC>>    *Section 1:\
    \ Number.* The officers of the IASF shall consist of a\nC>>    Chairman of the\
    \ Board, a Treasurer and a Secretary, and such\nC>>    other inferior officers\
    \ as the BoT may determine.\nC>>\nC>>    *Section 2: Election Term of Office and\
    \ Qualifications.* All\nC>>    officers shall be elected annually by the vote\
    \ of a majority of\nC>>    the Board of Trustees present and voting (excluding\
    \ abstentions)\nC>>    at the Annual Meeting.  The Treasurer and Secretary need\
    \ not be\nC>>    members of the Board.  The Chair of the IETF nor the chair of\
    \ the\nC>>    IAB shall be the Chairman of the Board of the IASF.\nC>>\nC>>  \
    \  *Section 3: Resignation.* An officer may resign by delivering his\nC>>    written\
    \ resignation to the IASF at its principal office or to the\nC>>    Chair or Secretary.\
    \  Such resignation shall be effective upon\nC>>    receipt or upon such date\
    \ (if any) as is stated in such\nC>>    resignation, unless otherwise determined\
    \ by the Board.\nC>>\nC>>    *Section 4: Removal.* The BoT may remove any officer\
    \ with or\nC>>    without cause by a vote of a majority of the entire number of\n\
    C>>    Trustees then in office, at a meeting of the BoT called for that\nC>> \
    \   purpose.  An officer may be removed for cause only if notice of\nC>>    such\
    \ action shall have been given to all of the Trustees prior to\nC>>    the meeting\
    \ at which such action is to be taken and if the\nC>>    officer so to be removed\
    \ shall have been given reasonable notice\nC>>    and opportunity to be heard\
    \ by the BoT.\nC>>\nC>>    *Section 5: Vacancies.* In case any elected officer\
    \ position of\nC>>    the IASF becomes vacant, the majority of the Trustees in\
    \ office,\nC>>    although less than a quorum, may elect an officer to fill such\n\
    C>>    vacancy at the next meeting of the BoT, and the officer so\nC>>    elected\
    \ shall hold office and serve until the next Annual\nC>>    Meeting.\nC>>\nC>>\
    \    *Section 6: Chairman of the Board.* The Chairman of the Board\nC>>    shall,\
    \ when present, preside at all meetings of the BoT of the\nC>>    IASF.  If the\
    \ Chairman is not available to preside over a\nC>>    meeting, the majority of\
    \ the Trustees present shall select\nC>>    another Trustee to preside at that\
    \ meeting only.\nC>>\nC>>    *Section 7: Treasurer.* The Treasurer shall have\
    \ the custody of\nC>>    all funds, property, and securities of the IASF, subject\
    \ to such\nC>>    regulations as may be imposed by the Board of Trustees.  He\
    \ or\nC>>    she may be required to give bond for the faithful performance of\n\
    C>>    his or her duties, in such sum and with such sureties as the BoT\nC>> \
    \   may require or as required by law, whichever is greater.  When\nC>>    necessary\
    \ or proper, he or she may endorse on behalf of the IASF\nC>>    for collection,\

    \ on behalf of the IASF, any contracts or agreements, and he or\nC>>    she may\
    \ affix the corporate seal of the IASF.  He or she, in\nC>>    general, performs\

    C>>\nC>>\nC>>    Quite a bit of the proposals from the consultant report have\
    \ been\nC>>    incorporated in this recommendation.  However, a number of\nC>>\
    \    changes have been made.  In this section we try to explain which\nC>>   \
    \ changes were made and why.\nC>>\nC>> A.1  Changes to the name of the administrative\
    \ entity\nC>>\nC>>    In order to make it very clear that the new and legal\n\
    C>>    administrative entity is separate from the ISOC IETF activity\nC>>    that\
    \ deals with standardization and protocol development, this\nC>>    recommendation\
    \ uses \"The IETF Administrative Support Foundation\"\nC>>    as the name for\
    \ the corporation to be created.\nC>>\nC>> A.2  Domicile\nC>>\nC>>    Various\
    \ questions have been raised if the choice of Domicile\nC>>    should be further\
    \ investigated.  In order to make progress this\nC>>    document recommends to\
    \ make a definite choice now and go for a US\nC>>    based not-for-profit corporation\
    \ in the state of Virginia.\nC>>    Further investigation would most probably\
    \ delay the whole process\nC>>    by at least half a year.\nC>>\nC>> A.3  Changes\
    \ to the composition of the BoT\nC>>\nC>>    The consultant report had a proposal\
    \ for Position-based Trustees,\nC>>    which would automatically make the IAB\
    \ chair and the IETF chair\nC>>    voting members of the Board of Trustees (BoT)\
    \ of the IETF\nC>>    Administrative Support Foundation.  There was discussion\
    \ on the\nC>>    IETF mailing list that those people are not selected because\
    \ of\nC>>    their business acumen but rather for their technical leadership.\n\
    C>>    We do not want to change those criteria.  Another concern was\nC>>    that\
    \ this might generate a conflict of interest as well.  So this\nC>>    recommendation\
    \ has made the IAB and IETF chairs liaisons to the\nC>>    BoT.\nC>>\nC>>    Instead\
    \ of making IAB and IESG chairs voting Trustees, this\nC>>    recommendation specifies\
    \ that IAB and IESG can each select an\nC>>    outside (i.e.  not a member of\
    \ IAB or IESG) person as a voting\nC>>    Trustee.\nC>>\nC>>    The selection\
    \ of three (3) IETF selected Trustees has not changed\nC>>    in this recommendation.\
    \  However, there is a concern that the\nC>>    current composition of the Nomcom\
    \ is not tailored to selecting\nC>>    people for this position.  So over time\
    \ a different process may\nC>>    need to be defined for selecting those Trustees.\n\
    C>>\nC>>    In order to balance the ISOC and IETF people present at the BoT\n\
    C>>    meetings, this recommendation also specifies that the chair and\nC>>\n\
    C>>    president of ISOC also function as liaisons to the BoT of the\nC>>    IETF\
    \ Administrative Support Foundation.\nC>>\nC>> Appendix B.  Domicile of the IETF\
    \ Administrative Support Foundation\nC>>\nC>>    A U.S.  non-profit, non-member\
    \ corporation is being recommended.\nC>>    This recommendation is based on simple\
    \ considerations of\nC>>    expediency and pragmatism: a transition will be simplest\
    \ and\nC>>    least risky (in the short term).  The reasoning is as follows:\n\
    C>>\nC>>    o  Administrative support for the IETF is currently enmeshed in a\n\
    C>>       series of relationships with other institutions, most of which\nC>>\
    \       are also U.S.-chartered non-profit organizations.  Any change\nC>>   \
    \    in the institutional status of administrative support\nC>>       functions\
    \ will require familiarity with U.S.  nonprofit law.\nC>>       Incorporation\
    \ in another country would require familiarity\nC>>       with those laws as well.\
    \ Thus, the incorporation expenses\nC>>       would be higher and the process\
    \ would take longer.\nC>>\nC>>    o  U.S.  law has a strong concept of \"nexus,\"\
    \ which is a\nC>>       determination of when a foreign organization has enough\n\
    C>>       relationship to U.S.  law to fall under the jurisdiction of a\nC>> \
    \      U.S. court.  Because of a long history of operating in the\nC>>       U.S.,\
    \ numerous meetings in the U.S., and the large number of\nC>>       U.S. residents\
    \ who are participants and leaders, we feel it is\nC>>       likely that U.S.\
    \  courts would find nexus in relation to our\nC>>       US-based activities,\
    \ even if the IETF administrative support\nC>>       organization was incorporated\
    \ in another country.  In other\nC>>       words, incorporating in a country besides\
    \ the U.S.  does not\nC>>       necessarily free the support organization from\
    \ any perceived\nC>>       vagaries of U.S. law.\nC>>\nC>>    o  Incorporating\
    \ in a country other than the US may have tax\nC>>       implications if the Internet\
    \ Society is providing funding\nC>>       support.\nC>>\nC>>    o  It is very\
    \ likely that the IETF Administrative Support\nC>>       Foundation would be deemed\
    \ to clearly fall under the\nC>>       \"scientific\" and \"educational\" grounds\
    \ for classification as a\nC>>       tax-exempt charity under section 501(c)(3)\
    \ of the IRS code, so\nC>>       a tax-exempt application should be quite straight-forward.\n\
    C>>\nC>>    o  The incorporation laws of the U.S.  states being considered do\n\
    C>>       not require that any members of the Board of Trustees be of a\nC>> \
    \      certain nationality or state residency (e.g., there are no\nC>>       \"\
    local director\" requirements).  The U.S.  Dept.  of Commerce\nC>>       foreign-controlled\
    \ organization reporting requirements apply\nC>>       only to \"business enterprises\"\
    , and do not apply to non-profit\nC>>\nC>>       entities such as an IETF administrative\
    \ support organization.\nC>>\nC>>    Since this document recommends incorporating\
    \ in the U.S.,\nC>>    Virginia is the logical pick as the state of domicile to\
    \ allow\nC>>    the IETF administrative support organization to make use of ISOC\n\
    C>>    headquarters to house its single employee (though the employee\nC>>   \
    \ might be able to be housed at the Internet Society even if the\nC>>    incorporation\
    \ were elsewhere, for example the ISOC Geneva\nC>>    office).\nC>>\nC>> Appendix\
    \ C.  Risk Analysis\nC>>\nC>>    This scenario (as do all scenarios) has some\
    \ risks.  This section\nC>>    tries to enumerate the sort of risks that we recognize\
    \ and\nC>>    summarizes why we think we can accept the risk or what kind of\n\
    C>>    action we think we can take if the risk indeed materializes into\nC>> \
    \   a problem.\nC>>\nC>> C.1  US Domicile risks\nC>>\nC>>    As explained in [I-D.malamud-consultant-report],\
    \ incorporating in\nC>>    the US carries two specific risks: the perception of\
    \ the IETF\nC>>    being a US-based organization and the potential for (or\nC>>\
    \    perception of) governmental interference.\nC>>\nC>>    The IETF is an international\
    \ organization.  However, even now,\nC>>    the fact that the IETF standards processes\
    \ are run in English and\nC>>    that many of its current support organizations\
    \ are US-based\nC>>    leaves an impression that the IETF is too US-centric.\n\
    C>>    Incorporating the new administrative entity in the US may add to\nC>> \
    \   that perception.\nC>>\nC>>    Also, the IETF history is based in US federal\
    \ government research\nC>>    and funding.  Though IETF is long separated from\
    \ those\nC>>    beginnings, even in the past few years there have been\nC>>  \
    \  interactions between the US government and the IETF that have\nC>>    concerned\
    \ people.  Incorporating the administrative entity in the\nC>>    US may invite\
    \ more US governmental interference in the standards\nC>>    activity of the IETF,\
    \ or at the very least may leave the\nC>>    perception that the US government\
    \ might get involved.\nC>>\nC>>    Both of these are serious problems, but we\
    \ think there is\nC>>    justification for and at least one mitigation to these\
    \ risks.  Of\nC>>    course, the primary reason to consider US incorporation is\n\
    C>>    expedience (See section 4.4.1.1 of [I-D.malamud-consultant-\nC>>    report]).\
    \  We agree that the expedience makes US incorporation\nC>>    worth the risk.\
    \  But incorporating in multiple domiciles would\nC>>    significantly mitigate\
    \ the risk.  Assuming we go down the path of\nC>>\nC>>    US incorporation, we\
    \ would like legal counsel to advise on the\nC>>    possibility of incorporating\
    \ in other domiciles (specifically\nC>>    Switzerland and The Netherlands) at\
    \ a later date after US\nC>>    incorporation has been completed.  If this is\
    \ (as we suspect)\nC>>    indeed possible, we think this would be the best way\
    \ to go\nC>>    forward.\nC>>\nC>> C.2  Non-profit status risk\nC>>\nC>>    One\
    \ of the risks pointed out to incorporation was the potential\nC>>    that we\
    \ would not get non-profit status, and that we must\nC>>    therefore preserve\
    \ some money in escrow for tax liability\nC>>    purposes.  Estimates for the\
    \ time it will take to get such status\nC>>    can be several months or even longer\
    \ in some cases.\nC>>\nC>>    It is important to point out that the tax liability\
    \ is based on\nC>>    profits, not on gross revenues.  If the IASF is only taking\
    \ in\nC>>    enough money to cover expenses, there would be very little tax\n\
    C>>    liability. However, if more revenue is brought in than is spent,\nC>> \
    \   for example to build up an endowment or operating reserve, that\nC>>    \"\
    profit\" is potentially taxable if non-profit status is not\nC>>    granted.\n\
    C>>\nC>>    To mitigate this risk, the corporation could be created and non-\n\
    C>>    profit status applied for first, and operation of the corporation\nC>>\
    \    would only begin after non-profit status was obtained.  The IETF\nC>>   \
    \ would use an interim plan for continued operations until that\nC>>    time.\
    \ This way, no money would need to be in escrow during the\nC>>    process of\
    \ applying for non-profit status.  However, that seems\nC>>    an excessively\
    \ cautious path to take given what appears to be the\nC>>    fairly clear non-profit\
    \ nature of the IETF.\nC>>\nC>>    Commencing operations while the non-profit\
    \ application is being\nC>>    considered, but being careful about balancing revenue\
    \ with\nC>>    expenses and keeping an appropriate escrow account seems like a\n\
    C>>    prudent task. Further, any fund raising campaigns that result in\nC>> \
    \   shifts to the balance sheet of the IASF should be conducted\nC>>    cautiously\
    \ until non-profit status is granted.\nC>>\nC>> C.3  Execution risks\nC>>\nC>>\
    \    It is important that the execution goes well.  Risks that we are\nC>>   \
    \ aware of include:\nC>>\nC>>    o  we can't hire a good IAD\nC>>\nC>>    o  we\
    \ fail to project cash flow properly and go insolvent\nC>>\nC>>    o  we can't\
    \ cut a deal with Foretec and have no 2005 meetings\nC>>\nC>>    o  we get bad\
    \ lawyers and they take too long and charge too much\nC>>\nC>>    o  isoc runs\
    \ out of money and doesn't tell us early enough\nC>>\nC>>    In order to mitigate\
    \ these problems we have a proposed work plan\nC>>    included in this document.\
    \  It is important that we get review of\nC>>    this work plan by as many eyes\
    \ as we can get, to make sure we\nC>>    have considered all the possible steps\
    \ that need to be taken.\nC>>\nC>> C.4  Insolvency risk\nC>>\nC>>    Improper\
    \ management controls and procedures or other imprudent\nC>>    fiscal or administrative\
    \ practices could expose the IETF to a\nC>>    risk of insolvency.  Careful selection\
    \ of trustees, a process of\nC>>    budget approval, and a methodical system of\
    \ fiscal controls are\nC>>    necessary to minimize this risk.\nC>>\nC>> C.5 \
    \ Legal risks\nC>>\nC>>    Improper formulation of the legal framework underlying\
    \ the IETF\nC>>    may expose the institution and individuals in leadership\n\
    C>>    positions to potential legal risks.  Any such risk under this\nC>>    plan\
    \ appears to be equivalent to the risk faced by the community\nC>>    under the\
    \ current legal framework.  This risk is further\nC>>    mitigated by a thorough\
    \ review by legal counsel, and by use of\nC>>    insurance coverage.\nC>>\nC>>\
    \    The legal exposure is best minimized by a careful adherence to\nC>>    our\
    \ procedures and processes, as defined by the Best Current\nC>>    Practice Series.\
    \  A carefully stated process, such as the BCP\nC>>    documents that govern the\
    \ selection of leadership positions and\nC>>    define the standards process are\
    \ the best insurance against legal\nC>>    exposure, provided care is taken to\
    \ stick to the process\nC>>    standards that have been set. Adherence to a public\
    \ rule book and\nC>>    a fully open process are the most effective mechanisms\
    \ the IETF\nC>>    community can use.\nAppendix: Scenario O\n   This Appendix\

    \ BCP\nO>>\nO>>    This section proposes draft text for a BCP that would define\
    \ the\nO>>    scope and structure of the IASA.  Although this text would\nO>>\
    \    require further refinement within the IETF community, this\nO>>    section\
    \ is intended to be clear and complete enough to allow the\nO>>    community to\
    \ reach a well-informed opinion regarding this\nO>>    scenario.\nO>>\nO>> 2.1\
    \  Definition of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)\nO>>\nO>>   \
    \ The IETF undertakes its technical activities as an ongoing, open,\nO>>    consensus-based\
    \ process.  The Internet Society has long been a\nO>>    part of the IETF's standards\
    \ process, and this document does not\nO>>    affect the ISOC-IETF working relationship\
    \ concerning standards\nO>>    development or communication of technical advice.\
    \  The purpose of\nO>>    this memo is to define an administrative support activity\
    \ that is\nO>>    responsive to the IETF technical community's needs, as well\
    \ as\nO>>    consistent with ISOC's operational, financial and fiduciary\nO>>\
    \    requirements while supporting the IETF technical activity.\nO>>\nO>>    The\
    \ IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) provides\nO>>    administrative\
    \ support for the technical work of the IETF.  This\nO>>\nO>>    includes, as\
    \ appropriate,  undertaking or contracting for the\nO>>    work described in (currently,\
    \ [RFC3716] but the eventual BCP\nO>>    should include the detail as an appendix),\
    \ covering IETF document\nO>>    and data management, IETF meetings, any operational\
    \ agreements or\nO>>    contracts with the RFC Editor and IANA.  This provides\
    \ the\nO>>    administrative backdrop required to support the IETF standards\n\
    O>>    process and to support the IETF organized technical activities,\nO>>  \
    \  including the IESG, IAB and working groups.  This includes the\nO>>    financial\
    \ activities associated with such IETF support\nO>>    (collecting IETF meeting\
    \ fees, payment of invoices, appropriate\nO>>    financial management, etc). \
    \ The IASA is responsible for ensuring\nO>>    that the IETF's administrative\
    \ activities are done and done well;\nO>>    it is not the expectation that the\
    \ IASA will undertake the work\nO>>    directly, but rather contract the work\
    \ from others, and manage\nO>>    the contractual relationships in line with key\
    \ operating\nO>>    principles such as efficiency, transparency and cost\nO>>\
    \    effectiveness.\nO>>\nO>>    The IASA is distinct from other IETF-related\
    \ technical functions,\nO>>    such as the RFC editor, the Internet Assigned Numbers\
    \ Authority\nO>>    (IANA), and the IETF standards process itself.  The IASA is\
    \ not\nO>>    intended to have any influence on the technical decisions of the\n\
    O>>    IETF or on the technical contents of IETF work.\nO>>\nO>> 2.1.1  Structure\
    \ of the IASA\nO>>\nO>>    The IASA will be structured to allow accountability\
    \ to the IETF\nO>>    community.  It will determine the ongoing success of the\
    \ activity\nO>>    in meeting IETF community needs laid out in this BCP, as well\
    \ as\nO>>    ISOC oversight of its financial and resource contributions.  The\n\
    O>>    supervisory body defined for this will be called the IETF\nO>>    Administrative\
    \ Oversight Committee (IAOC).  The IAOC will consist\nO>>    of volunteers, all\
    \ chosen directly or indirectly by the IETF\nO>>    community, as well as appropriate\
    \ ex officio appointments from\nO>>    ISOC and IETF leadership.  The IAOC will\
    \ be accountable to the\nO>>    IETF community for the effectiveness, efficiency\
    \ and transparency\nO>>    of the IASA.\nO>>\nO>>    The IASA will initially consist\
    \ of a single full-time employee of\nO>>    ISOC, the IETF Administrative Director\
    \ (IAD).  The IAD will\nO>>    require a variety of financial, legal and administrative\
    \ support,\nO>>    and it is expected that this support will be provided by ISOC\n\
    O>>    support staff following an expense and/or allocation model TBD.\nO>>\n\
    O>>    Although the IAD will be a full-time ISOC employee, he will work\nO>> \
    \   under the direction of the IAOC.  The IAD will be selected by a\nO>>    committee\
    \ of the IAOC, consisting minimally of the ISOC President\nO>>    and the IETF\
    \ Chair.  This same committee will be responsible for\nO>>    periodically reviewing\
    \ the performance of the IAD and determining\nO>>    any changes to his employment\
    \ and compensation.  In certain cases\nO>>    (to be defined clearly -- chiefly\
    \ cases where the ISOC employee\nO>>    is determined to have contravened basic\
    \ ISOC policies), the ISOC\nO>>    President may make summary decisions, to be\
    \ reviewed by the\nO>>    hiring committee after the fact.\nO>>\nO>>    The IAD\
    \ will be responsible for administering the IETF finances,\nO>>    managing a\
    \ separate bank account for the IASA, and establishing\nO>>    and administering\
    \ the IASA budget.  To perform these activities,\nO>>    the IAD is expected to\
    \ have signing authority comparable to other\nO>>    ISOC director-level employees.\
    \  Generally, expenses or agreements\nO>>    outside that authority to be approved\
    \ for financial soundness as\nO>>    determined by ISOC policy.  The joint expectation\
    \ is that ISOC's\nO>>    policies will be consistent with allowing the IAD to\
    \ carry out\nO>>    IASA work effectively and efficiently.  Should the IAOC have\n\
    O>>    concerns about that, the IAOC and ISOC commit to working out\nO>>    other\
    \ policies that are mutually agreeable.\nO>>\nO>>    The IAD will also fill the\
    \ role of the IETF Executive Director,\nO>>    as described in various IETF process\
    \ BCPs.  All other\nO>>    administrative functions will be outsourced via well-defined\n\
    O>>    contracts.  The IAD will be responsible for negotiating and\nO>>    maintaining\
    \ those contracts, as well as providing any\nO>>    coordination that is necessary\
    \ to make sure the IETF\nO>>    administrative support functions are properly\
    \ covered.\nO>>\nO>> 2.1.2  IAD Responsibilities\nO>>\nO>>    The day to day responsibilities\
    \ of the IAD will focus on managing\nO>>    contracts with the entities providing\
    \ the work supporting the\nO>>    IETF technical activity.\nO>>\nO>>    The IAD\
    \ will provide regular (monthly and quarterly) reports to\nO>>    the IAOC and\
    \ ISOC.\nO>>\nO>>    All contracts will be negotiated by the IAD (with input from\
    \ any\nO>>    other appropriate bodies), and reviewed by the IAOC.  The\nO>> \
    \   contracts will be executed by ISOC, on behalf of the IETF, after\nO>>    whatever\
    \ review ISOC requires (e.g., legal, Board of Trustees).\nO>>\nO>>    The IAD\
    \ will prepare an annual budget, which will be reviewed and\nO>>    approved by\
    \ the IAOC.  The IAD will be responsible for presenting\nO>>    this budget to\
    \ the ISOC Board of Trustees, as part of ISOC's\nO>>    annual financial planning\
    \ process.  The partnering is such that\nO>>    the IAOC is responsible for ensuring\
    \ the suitability of the\nO>>    budget for meeting the IETF community's needs,\
    \ but it does not\nO>>    bear fiduciary responsibility; the ISOC board needs\
    \ to review and\nO>>\nO>>    understand the budget and planned activity in have\
    \ enough detail\nO>>    of the budget and proposed plans to properly carry out\
    \ its\nO>>    fiduciary responsibility.\nO>>\nO>> 2.1.3  IAOC Responsibilities\n\
    O>>\nO>>    The role of the IAOC is to provide appropriate input to the IAD,\n\
    O>>    and oversight of the IASA functioning.  The IAOC is not expected\nO>> \
    \   to be regularly engaged in IASA work, but rather to provide\nO>>    appropriate\
    \ approval and oversight.\nO>>\nO>>    Therefore, the IAOC's responsibilities\
    \ are:\nO>>\nO>>    o  Select the IAD, as described above.\nO>>\nO>>    o  Review\
    \ the IAD's financial reports, and provide approval of\nO>>       the IAD's budget\
    \ proposals in terms of fitness for IETF\nO>>       purposes.\nO>>\nO>>    o \
    \ Review IASA functioning with respect to meeting the IETF\nO>>       community's\
    \ working needs.\nO>>\nO>>    The IAOC's role is to review, not carry out the\
    \ work of,  the IAD\nO>>    and IASA.  As such, it is expected the IAOC will have\
    \ monthly\nO>>    teleconferences and periodic face to face meetings, probably\n\
    O>>    coincident with IETF plenary meetings, consistent with ensuring\nO>>  \
    \  an efficient and effective operation.\nO>>\nO>> 2.1.4  IASA Funding\nO>>\n\
    O>>    The IASA is supported financially in 3 ways:\nO>>\nO>>    1.  IETF meeting\
    \ revenues.  The IAD, in consultation with the\nO>>        IAOC, sets the meeting\
    \ fees as part of the budgeting process.\nO>>        All meeting revenues go to\
    \ the IASA.\nO>>\nO>>    2.  Designated ISOC donations.  The IETF and IASA do\
    \ no specific\nO>>        fund raising activities; this maintains separation between\n\
    O>>        fundraising and standards activities.  Any organization\nO>>      \
    \  interested in supporting the IETF activity will continue to\nO>>        be\
    \ directed to ISOC, and any funds ISOC receives specifically\nO>>        for IETF\
    \ activities (as part of an ISOC program that allows\nO>>        for specific\
    \ designation) will be put in the IASA bank\nO>>        account for IASA management.\n\
    O>>\nO>>    3.  Other ISOC support.  ISOC will deposit in the IASA account,\n\
    O>>        each quarter, the funds committed to providing as part of the\nO>>\
    \        IASA budget (where the meeting revenues and specific\nO>>\nO>>      \
    \  donations do not cover the budget).  These funds may come\nO>>        from\
    \ member fees or from other revenue streams ISOC may\nO>>        create.\nO>>\n\
    O>>    Note that the goal is to achieve and maintain a viable IETF\nO>>    support\
    \ function based on meeting fees and specified donations,\nO>>    and the IAOC\
    \ and ISOC are expected to work together to attain\nO>>    that goal.  (I.e.,\
    \ dropping the meeting fees to $0 and expecting\nO>>    ISOC to pick up the slack\
    \ is not desirable; nor is raising the\nO>>    meeting fees to prohibitive levels\
    \ to fund all non-meeting-\nO>>    related activities!).\nO>>\nO>>    Also, in\
    \ normal operating circumstances, the IASA would look to\nO>>    have a 6 month\
    \ operating reserve for its activities.  Rather than\nO>>    having the IASA attempt\
    \ to accrue that in its bank account, the\nO>>    IASA looks to ISOC to build\
    \ and provide that operational reserve\nO>>    (through whatever mechanism instrument\
    \ ISOC deems appropriate --\nO>>    line of credit, financial reserves, etc).\
    \  Such reserves do not\nO>>    appear instantaneously; the goal is to reach that\
    \ level of\nO>>    reserve by 3 years after the creation of the IASA.  It is not\n\
    O>>    expected that any funds associated with such reserve will be held\nO>>\
    \    in the IASA bank account.\nO>>\nO>> 2.2  IAOC Membership, Selection and Accountability\n\
    O>>\nO>>    Note:  This section is particularly subject to change as we work\n\
    O>>    to find the best way to achieve the key principles.  The key\nO>>    principles\
    \ being adhered to are that while this should be\nO>>    reasonably separate from\
    \ IETF Standards process management:\nO>>\nO>>    o  the IETF and IAB Chairs need\
    \ to be involved to a level that\nO>>       permits them to be involved in and\
    \ oversee the aspects\nO>>       pertinent to their roles in managing the technical\
    \ work (e.g.,\nO>>       the IAB looks after the RFC Editor relationship)\nO>>\n\
    O>>    o  the IETF and IAB Chairs must not be critical path to getting\nO>>  \
    \     decisions to and through the IASA.\nO>>\nO>>    The current draft, below,\
    \ therefore makes the IETF Chair ex\nO>>    officio voting member of the IAOC,\
    \ and the IAB Chair a non-voting\nO>>    liaison. Future versions may change either\
    \ or both, depending on\nO>>    what makes sense to the IETF community in its\
    \ deliberations.\nO>>\nO>>    The IAOC will consist of seven voting members who\
    \ will be\nO>>    selected as follows:\nO>>\nO>>    o  2 members chosen by the\
    \ IETF Nominations Committee (NomCom)\nO>>\nO>>    o  1 member chosen by the IESG\n\
    O>>\nO>>    o  1 member chosen by the IAB\nO>>\nO>>    o  1 member chosen by the\
    \ ISOC Board of Trustees\nO>>\nO>>    o  The IETF Chair (ex officio)\nO>>\nO>>\
    \    o  The ISOC President/CEO (ex officio)\nO>>\nO>>    There will also be two\
    \ non-voting, ex officio liaisons:\nO>>\nO>>    o  The IAB Chair\nO>>\nO>>   \
    \ o  The IETF Administrative Director\nO>>\nO>>    The voting members of the IAOC\
    \ will choose their own chair each\nO>>    year using a consensus mechanism of\
    \ its choosing.  Any appointed\nO>>    voting member of the IAOC may serve as\
    \ the IAOC Chair (i.e., not\nO>>    the IETF Chair or the ISOC President/CEO).\
    \  The role of the IAOC\nO>>    Chair is to organize the IAOC.  The IAOC Chair\
    \ has no formal\nO>>    duties for representing the IAOC, except as directed by\
    \ IAOC\nO>>    consensus.\nO>>\nO>>    The members of the IAOC will typically\
    \ serve two year terms.\nO>>    Initially, the IESG and ISOC Board will make one-year\n\
    O>>    appointments, the IAB will make a two-year appointment, and the\nO>>  \
    \  Nomcom will make one one-year appointment and one two-year\nO>>    appointment\
    \ to establish a pattern where approximately half of\nO>>    the IAOC is selected\
    \ each term.\nO>>\nO>>    The two NomCom selected members will be selected using\
    \ the\nO>>    procedures described in RFC 3777.  For the initial selection, the\n\
    O>>    IESG will provide the list of desired qualifications for these\nO>>   \
    \ positions.  In later years, this list will be provided by the\nO>>    IAOC.\n\
    O>>\nO>>    While there are no hard rules regarding how the IAB and the IESG\n\
    O>>    should select members of the IAOC, it is not expected that they\nO>>  \
    \  will typically choose current IAB or IESG members, if only to\nO>>    avoid\
    \ overloading existing leadership.  However, they should\nO>>    choose people\
    \ who are familiar with the administrative support\nO>>    needs of the IAB, the\
    \ IESG and/or the IETF standards process.  It\nO>>    is suggested that a fairly\
    \ open process be followed for these\nO>>    selections, perhaps with an open\
    \ call for nominations and/or a\nO>>    period of public comment on the candidates.\
    \  The IAB and IESG are\nO>>    encouraged to look at the procedure for IAB selection\
    \ of ISOC\nO>>    Trustees for an example of how this might work.\nO>>\nO>>  \
    \  Although the IAB and IESG will choose some members of the IAOC,\nO>>    those\
    \ members will not directly represent the bodies that chose\nO>>    them.  All\
    \ members of the IAOC are accountable directly to the\nO>>    IETF community.\
    \ To receive direct feedback from the community,\nO>>    the IAOC will hold an\
    \ open meeting at least once per year at an\nO>>    IETF meeting.  This may take\
    \ the form of an open IAOC plenary or\nO>>    a working meeting held during an\
    \ IETF meeting slot.  The form and\nO>>    contents of this meeting are left to\
    \ the discretion of the IAOC\nO>>    Chair.\nO>>\nO>>    Decisions of IAOC members\
    \ or the entire IAOC are subject to\nO>>    appeal using the procedures described\
    \ in RFC 2026.  The initial\nO>>    appeal of an individual decision will go to\
    \ the full IAOC.\nO>>    Appeals of IAOC decisions will go to the IESG and continue\
    \ up the\nO>>    chain as necessary (to the IAB and the ISOC Board).  The IAOC\n\
    O>>    will play no role (aside from possible administrative support) in\nO>>\
    \    appeals of WG Chair, IESG or IAB decisions.\nO>>\nO>>    In the event that\
    \ an IAOC member abrogates his duties or acts\nO>>    against the bests interests\
    \ of the IETF community, IAOC members\nO>>    are subject to recall using the\
    \ recall procedure defined in RFC\nO>>    3777.  IAB and IESG-appointed members\
    \ of the IAOC are not subject\nO>>    to recall by their appointing bodies.\n\
    O>>\nO>> 2.3  IASA Budget Process\nO>>\nO>>    While the IASA sets a budget for\
    \ the IETF's administrative needs,\nO>>    its budget process clearly needs to\
    \ be closely coordinated with\nO>>    ISOC's. The specific timeline will be established\
    \ each year,\nO>>    before the second IETF meeting.  A general annual timeline\
    \ for\nO>>    budgeting will be:\nO>>\nO>>    July 1 The IAD presents a budget\
    \ proposal (for the following\nO>>       fiscal year, with 3 year projections)\
    \ to the IAOC.\nO>>\nO>>    August 1 The IAOC approves the budget proposal for\
    \ IETF purposes,\nO>>       after any appropriate revisions.  As the ISOC President\
    \ is\nO>>       part of the IAOC, the IAOC should have a preliminary\nO>>    \
    \   indication of how the budget will fit with ISOC's own\nO>>       budgetary\
    \ expectations.  The budget proposal is passed to the\nO>>       ISOC Board of\
    \ Trustees for review in accordance with their\nO>>       fiduciary duty.\nO>>\n\
    O>>    September 1 The ISOC Board of Trustees approves the budget\nO>>       proposal\
    \ provisionally.  During the next 2 months, the budget\nO>>       may be revised\
    \ to be integrated in ISOC's overall budgeting\nO>>       process.\nO>>\nO>>\n\
    O>>    November 1 Final budget to the ISOC Board for approval.\nO>>\nO>>    The\
    \ IAD will provide monthly accountings of expenses, and will\nO>>    update forecasts\
    \ of expenditures quarterly.  This may necessitate\nO>>    the adjustment of the\
    \ IASA budget.  The revised budget will need\nO>>    to be approved by the IAOC\
    \ and ISOC Board of Trustees.\nO>>\nO>> 2.4  Relationship of the IAOC to Existing\
    \ IETF Leadership\nO>>\nO>>    The IAOC will be directly accountable to the IETF\
    \ Community.\nO>>    However, the nature of the IAOC's work will involve treating\
    \ the\nO>>    IESG and IAB as internal customers.  The IAOC should not consider\n\
    O>>    its work successful unless the IESG and IAB are satisfied with\nO>>   \
    \ the administrative support that they are receiving.\nO>>\nO>> 2.5  ISOC Responsibilities\
    \ for IASA\nO>>\nO>>    Within ISOC, support for the IASA should be structured\
    \ to meet\nO>>    the following goals:\nO>>\nO>>    Transparency: The IETF community\
    \ should have complete visibility\nO>>       into the financial and legal structure\
    \ of the ISOC standards\nO>>       activity. In particular, the IETF community\
    \ should have access\nO>>       to a detailed budget for the entire standards\
    \ activity,\nO>>       quarterly financial reports and audited annual financials.\
    \  In\nO>>       addition, key contract material and MOUs should be publicly\n\
    O>>       available.  Most of these goals are already met by ISOC today.\nO>>\
    \       The IAOC will be responsible for providing the IETF community\nO>>   \
    \    with regular overviews of the state of affairs.\nO>>\nO>>    Unification:\
    \ As part of this arrangement, ISOC's sponsorship of\nO>>       the RFC Editor,\
    \ IAB and IESG, as well as insurance coverage\nO>>       for the IETF will be\
    \ managed as part of the IASA under the\nO>>       IAOC.\nO>>\nO>>    Independence:\
    \ The IASA should be financially and legally distinct\nO>>       from other ISOC\
    \ activities.  IETF meeting fees should be\nO>>       deposited in a separate\
    \ IETF-specific bank account and used to\nO>>       fund the IASA under the direction\
    \ and oversight of the IAOC.\nO>>       Any fees or payments collected from IETF\
    \ meeting sponsors\nO>>       should also be deposited into this account.  This\
    \ account will\nO>>       be administered by the IAD and used to fund the IASA\
    \ in\nO>>       accordance with a budget and policies that are developed as\n\
    O>>       described above.\nO>>\nO>>    Support: ISOC may, from time to time,\
    \ choose to transfer other\nO>>       funds into this account to fund IETF administrative\
    \ projects\nO>>       or to cover IETF meeting revenue shortfalls.  There may\
    \ also\nO>>\nO>>       be cases where ISOC chooses to loan money to the IASA to\
    \ help\nO>>       with temporary cash flow issues.  These cases should be\nO>>\
    \       carefully documented and tracked on both sides.  ISOC will\nO>>      \
    \ work to provide the 6 month operational reserve for IASA\nO>>       functioning\
    \ described above.\nO>>\nO>>    Removability: While there is no current plan to\
    \ transfer the\nO>>       legal and financial home of the IASA to another corporation,\n\
    O>>       the IASA should be structured to enable a clean transition in\nO>> \
    \      the event that the IETF community decides, through BCP\nO>>       publication,\
    \ that such a transition is required.  In that\nO>>       case, the IAOC will\
    \ give ISOC a minimum six months notice\nO>>       before the transition formally\
    \ occurs.  During that period,\nO>>       the IAOC and ISOC will work together\
    \ to create a smooth\nO>>       transition that does not result in any significant\
    \ service\nO>>       outages or missed IETF meetings.  All contracts that are\n\
    O>>       executed by ISOC as part of the IASA should either include a\nO>>  \
    \     clause allowing termination or transfer by ISOC with six\nO>>       months\
    \ notice, or should be transferrable to another\nO>>       corporation in the\
    \ event that the IASA is transitioned away\nO>>       from ISOC in the future.\
    \  Any accrued funds, and IETF-specific\nO>>       intellectual property rights\
    \ (concerning administrative data\nO>>       and/ or tools) would also be expected\
    \ to be transitioned to\nO>>       any new entity, as well.\nO>>\nO>>    Within\
    \ the constraints outlined above, all other details of how\nO>>    to structure\
    \ this activity within ISOC (as a cost center, a\nO>>    department or a formal\
    \ subsidiary) should be determined by ISOC\nO>>    in consultation with the IAOC.\n\
    O>>\nO>> 3.  Workplan for Formalizing the IETF Administrative Support\nO>> Activity\n\
    O>>\nO>>    This section proposes a workplan and schedule for formalizing the\n\
    O>>    IETF administrative support activity (IASA) for the remainder of\nO>> \
    \   2004 and 2005.\nO>>\nO>> 3.1  Workplan Goals\nO>>\nO>>    This workplan is\
    \ intended to satisfy four goals:\nO>>\nO>>    o  Satisfy the IETF's need for\
    \ support functions through 2005,\nO>>       with a careful transition that minimizes\
    \ the risk of\nO>>       substantial disruption to the IETF standards process.\n\
    O>>\nO>>    o  Establish IETF community consensus and ISOC approval of a BCP\n\
    O>>       formalizing the IASA as described in this scenario before any\nO>> \
    \      actions are taken that will have long term effects (hiring,\nO>>\nO>> \
    \      contacts, etc.)\nO>>\nO>>    o  Make sure that decisions with long term\
    \ impact, such as hiring\nO>>       the IAD and establishing contracts for administrative\
    \ support,\nO>>       are made by people chosen for that purpose who will be\n\
    O>>       responsible to the community for the effectiveness of this\nO>>    \
    \   effort (the IAD and members of the IAOC) -- not by our already\nO>>      \
    \ overloaded technical leadership.\nO>>\nO>>    o  Within the above constraints,\
    \ move as quickly as possible\nO>>       towards a well-defined administrative\
    \ support structure that\nO>>       is transparent and accountable to the IETF\
    \ community.\nO>>\nO>> 3.2  Workplan Overview\nO>>\nO>>    There are three major\
    \ elements to this workplan which can, to\nO>>    some degree, take place in parallel\
    \ after we establish IETF\nO>>    community consensus to pursue Scenario O:\n\
    O>>\nO>>    o  Finalizing the BCP text and getting it approved by the IETF\nO>>\
    \       community and ISOC.\nO>>\nO>>    o  Selecting IASA leadership.  This includes\
    \ appointing an\nO>>       interim IAOC, recruiting the IAD, and eventually appointing\n\
    O>>       the full IAOC.\nO>>\nO>>    o  Negotiating agreements with service providers.\
    \  This includes\nO>>       determining the structure and work flow of the IASA,\
    \ deciding\nO>>       which portions of the IASA should be staffed via an open\n\
    O>>       request for proposals (RFP) process, and issuing a RFP for\nO>>    \
    \   those portions, as well as establishing sole source contracts\nO>>       or\
    \ MOUs for other portions of the IASA.\nO>>\nO>>    Each of the three items listed\
    \ above is described in more detail\nO>>    in the following sections.\nO>>\n\
    O>> 3.3  Approval by the IETF Community and ISOC\nO>>\nO>>    In scenario O, the\
    \ IASA is formalized in a BCP that is approved\nO>>    by the IETF community and\
    \ accepted by the ISOC Board of Trustees.\nO>>    There are three steps in this\
    \ process:\nO>>\nO>>    1.  Establishment of IETF community consensus that we\
    \ should\nO>>        pursue Scenario O as defined in a joint IAB/IESG\nO>>   \
    \     recommendation based on this proposal.  This consensus will\nO>>       \
    \ be established through community discussion and a formal two-\nO>>        week\
    \ consensus call issued by the IETF chair on the IETF\nO>>        mailing list.\n\
    O>>\nO>>    2.  Establishment of IETF community consensus on a BCP that\nO>> \
    \       formalizes the IASA as described.  This consensus would be\nO>>      \
    \  established through public discussion, a four week IETF Last\nO>>        Call\
    \ and IESG review and approval.\nO>>\nO>>    3.  ISOC approval of the BCP and\
    \ acceptance of ISOC's\nO>>        responsibilities as described therein.  This\
    \ approval and\nO>>        acceptance would be signified by an ISOC Board resolution.\n\
    O>>\nO>>    The timeline for these three stages is rather long, but there is\n\
    O>>    significant progress that can be made in other areas once we have\nO>>\
    \    established IETF community consensus to pursue this scenario.\nO>>\nO>> 3.4\
    \  Selecting IASA Leadership\nO>>\nO>>    Once we have IETF consensus to pursue\
    \ this scenario, we can\nO>>    appoint an interim IAOC to begin working on the\
    \ IASA transition.\nO>>    The interim IAOC could do substantial work on non-binding\
    \ tasks,\nO>>    such as beginning the recruitment process for an IAD, determining\n\
    O>>    the structure of the IASA work, issuing RFPs and negotiating\nO>>    potential\
    \ agreements with service providers.  The interim IAOC\nO>>    would not be empowered\
    \ to make binding agreements, but could work\nO>>    appropriate consultants and\
    \ advisors to make a lot of progress\nO>>    towards determining the initial structure\
    \ and work flow of the\nO>>    IASA.\nO>>\nO>>    Because the IETF Nominations\
    \ Commitee (NomCom) process for new\nO>>    positions will consume a lot of resources\
    \ and take a long time to\nO>>    complete, we propose that the interim IAOC consist\
    \ of:\nO>>\nO>>    o  1 IESG selected member\nO>>\nO>>    o  1 IAB selected member\n\
    O>>\nO>>    o  1 ISOC selected member\nO>>\nO>>    o  The IETF Chair\nO>>\nO>>\
    \    o  The ISOC President/CEO\nO>>\nO>>    The IAB chair will serve as a liaison,\
    \ as described above.\nO>>\nO>>    The IESG and ISOC Board appointments will be\
    \ expected to serve\nO>>    until the first IETF meeting of 2006, and the IAB\
    \ appointment\nO>>    will be expected to serve until the first IETF meeting of\
    \ 2007,\nO>>    assuming that the BCP is approved and the IAOC continues to have\n\
    O>>    appointed members from these bodies.\nO>>\nO>>\nO>>    After all of the\
    \ interim IAOC members are selected, they will\nO>>    choose an interim IAOC\
    \ chair from among the appointed members.\nO>>\nO>>    When the BCP is approved,\
    \ if the BCP indicates that there will be\nO>>    NomCom selected IAOC members\
    \ they will be chosen at that time.\nO>>    Any adjustments to appointed members\
    \ based on the BCP contents\nO>>    will also be made at that time.  The IAOC\
    \ will transition from\nO>>    interim to non-interim status when all non-interim\
    \ members are\nO>>    seated.  A new, non-interim chair selection process will\
    \ then\nO>>    commence.\nO>>\nO>> 3.5  Recruiting the IETF Administrative Director\n\
    O>>\nO>>    The interim IAOC should appoint an IAD selection committee to\nO>>\
    \    recruit and select the IETF Administrative Director.  This\nO>>    committee\
    \ will consist entirely of IAOC members or liaisons, and\nO>>    will, at minimum,\
    \ include the IETF chair and the ISOC President.\nO>>    If the IAOC chooses,\
    \ this committee could include the entire\nO>>    IAOC.\nO>>\nO>>    The IAD selection\
    \ committee should determine a job description\nO>>    for the IAD, in consultation\
    \ with other IETF leaders and the IETF\nO>>    community.  Once the job description\
    \ is established, the IAD\nO>>    selection committee should recruiting candidates\
    \ for the\nO>>    position.\nO>>\nO>>    Although the interim IAOC is not empowered\
    \ to hire the IAD as a\nO>>    full-time employee, it might be possible for the\
    \ IAOC to ask ISOC\nO>>    to engage the potential IAD as a consultant to help\
    \ with other\nO>>    tasks during the interim period.\nO>>\nO>> 3.6  Establishing\
    \ Agreement with Service Providers\nO>>\nO>>    The most important activity of\
    \ the IAOC during late 2004 and\nO>>    early 2005 will be to determine the structure\
    \ and work flow of\nO>>    the IASA and to establish contracts or other agreements\
    \ with\nO>>    service providers to do the required work.  This work includes\n\
    O>>    the following functions as defined in the consultant's report:\nO>>\nO>>\
    \    o  Technical infrastructure\nO>>\nO>>    o  Meeting management\nO>>\nO>>\
    \    o  Clerk's office\nO>>\nO>>    o  RFC Editor services to support  IETF standards\
    \ publication\nO>>\nO>>    o  IANA services to support IETF standards publication\n\
    O>>\nO>>    The interim IAOC should work with IETF leaders and other\nO>>    knowledgeable\
    \ members of the community to determine the structure\nO>>    and work flow required\
    \ for the IASA activity and make\nO>>    corresponding adjustments to the above\
    \ list, if necessary.  The\nO>>    interim IAOC can also identify which areas\
    \ of IASA work should\nO>>    continue to be provided by existing IETF service\
    \ providers, and\nO>>    work with those providers to establish proposed contracts\
    \ or\nO>>    agreements for later approval by the non-interim IAOC.  The IAOC\n\
    O>>    can also choose to start an RFP process for any services that\nO>>    they\
    \ believe should be filled through an open RFP process.\nO>>\nO>> 3.7  Establishing\
    \ a 2005 Operating Budget\nO>>\nO>>    Because the ISOC 2005 budgeting process\
    \ will be finalized before\nO>>    the non-interim IAOC is seated, the interim\
    \ IAOC should work with\nO>>    the ISOC staff and President to establish a proposed\
    \ 2005\nO>>    operating budget for the IASA.  Since this will happen in advance\n\
    O>>    of full knowledge regarding the costs of 2005 operations, it may\nO>> \
    \   be subject to significant adjustment later.\nO>>\nO>> 3.8  Proposed Schedule\
    \ for IASA Transition\nO>>\nO>>    As described above, the three stages of the\
    \ IETF community and\nO>>    ISOC approval process will take some time.  If the\
    \ community\nO>>    chooses scenario O and we reach quick consensus on the details,\n\
    O>>    an optimistic schedule for this approval would be:\nO>>\nO>>    1.  IETF\
    \ discussion of this proposal and other scenarios through\nO>>         1-Oct-2005.\
    \  IAB/IESG discusses this proposal with ISOC\nO>>         Board.\nO>>\nO>>  \
    \  2.  IAB/IESG joint recommendation issued on 8-Oct-04, including\nO>>      \
    \   full BCP proposal.\nO>>\nO>>    3.  Community discussion of the joint IAB/IESG\
    \ recommendation\nO>>         through 22-Oct-04.\nO>>\nO>>    4.  Two-week community\
    \ consensus call issued on the IETF list on\nO>>         23-Oct-04 regarding rough\
    \ community consensus to pursue this\nO>>         direction and appoint an interim\
    \ IAOC -- extends through\nO>>         IETF 61.  IAOC selecting bodies begin search,\
    \ based on\nO>>         expected community consensus.\nO>>\nO>>    5.  Rough community\
    \ consensus declared on 8-Nov-04 to pursue\nO>>         Scenario O and appoint\
    \ the interim IAOC.\nO>>\nO>>    6.  Interim IAOC seated on 15-Nov-04.  Interim\
    \ IAOC begins\nO>>         interim work outlined above, including establishment\
    \ of\nO>>\nO>>         estimated 2005 budget and IAD recruitment.\nO>>\nO>>  \
    \  7.  BCP text  discussed by community, IETF leadership and ISOC\nO>>       \
    \  Board until we have something that represents rough\nO>>         community\
    \ consensus that is acceptable to all.  We hope that\nO>>         this could be\
    \ completed by 6-Dec-04.\nO>>\nO>>    8.  Four week IETF Last Call issued for\
    \ BCP on 6-Dec-04 --\nO>>         extends through 3-Jan-04.\nO>>\nO>>    9.  Simultaneous\
