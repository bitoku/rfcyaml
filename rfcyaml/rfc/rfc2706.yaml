  - "1.1 Background\n   Today, numerous merchants are successfully conducting business\
    \ on the\n   Internet using HTML-based forms. The data formats used in these forms\n\
    \   varies considerably from one merchant to another. End-users find the\n   diversity\
    \ confusing and the process of manually filling in these\n   forms to be tedious.\
    \  The result is that many merchant forms,\n   reportedly around two thirds, are\
    \ abandoned during the fill in\n   process.\n   Software tools called electronic\
    \ wallets can help this situation.  A\n   digital wallet is an application or\
    \ service that assists consumers in\n   conducting online transactions by allowing\
    \ them to store billing,\n   shipping, payment, and preference information and\
    \ to use this\n   information to automatically complete merchant interactions.\
    \  This\n   greatly simplifies the check-out process and minimizes the need for\
    \ a\n   consumer to complete a merchant's form every time.  Digital wallets\n\
    \   that fill forms have been successfully built into browsers, as helper\n  \
    \ applications to browsers, as stand-alone applications, as browser\n   plug-ins,\
    \ and as server-based applications.  But the proliferation of\n   electronic wallets\
    \ has been hampered by the lack of standards.\n   ECML (Electronic Commerce Modeling\
    \ Language, <www.ecml.org>) Version\n   1 provides a set of simple guidelines\
    \ for web merchants that will\n   enable electronic wallets from multiple vendors\
    \ to fill in their web\n   forms. The end-result is that more consumers will find\
    \ shopping on\n   the web to be easy and compelling.\n   The set of fields documented\
    \ herein was developed by the\n   Wallet/Merchant Standards Alliance (www.ecml.org)\
    \ which now includes,\n   in alphabetic order, the following:\n            American\
    \ Express (www.americanexpress.com)\n            AOL (www.aol.com)\n         \
    \   Brodia (www.brodia.com)\n            Compaq (www.compaq.com)\n           \
    \ CyberCash (www.cybercash.com)\n            Discover (www.discovercard.com)\n\
    \            FSTC (www.fstc.org)\n            IBM (www.ibm.com)\n            Mastercard\
    \ (www.mastercard.com)\n            Microsoft (www.microsoft.com)\n          \
    \  Novell (www.novell.com)\n            SETCo (www.setco.org)\n            Sun\
    \ Microsystems (www.sun.com)\n            Trintech (www.trintech.com)\n      \
    \      Visa (www.visa.com)\n   The fields are derived from and consistent with\
    \ the W3C P3P base data\n   schema at\n      <http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-P3P/basedata.html>.\n"
- title: 1.2 Relationship to Other Standards
  contents:
  - "1.2 Relationship to Other Standards\n   ECML Version 1 is not a replacement or\
    \ alternative to SSL/TLS [RFC\n   2246], SET [SET], XML [XML], or IOTP [IOTP].\
    \ These are important\n   standards that provide functionality such as non-repudiatable\n\
    \   transactions, automatable payment scheme selection, and smart card\n   support.\n\
    \   ECML may be used with any payment mechanism.  It simply allows a\n   merchant\
    \ to publish consistent simple web forms.\n   Multiple wallets and multiple merchants\
    \ plan to interoperably support\n   ECML.  This is an open standard. ECML is designed\
    \ to be simple.\n   Version 1 of the project adds no new technology to the web.\
    \  A\n   merchant can adopt ECML and gain the support of these multiple\n   Wallets\
    \ by making very simple changes to the HTML pages that they\n   currently use\
    \ to support their customers.  Use of ECML requires no\n   license.\n"
- title: 1.3 Areas Deferred to Future Versions
  contents:
  - "1.3 Areas Deferred to Future Versions\n   Standardization of information fields\
    \ transmitted from the merchant\n   to the consumer, considerations for business\
    \ purchasing cards, non-\n   card payment mechanisms, wallet activation, privacy\
    \ related\n   mechanisms, additional payment mechanisms, and any sort of\n   \"\
    negotiation\" were among the areas deferred to consideration in\n   future versions.\
    \  Hidden or other special fields were minimized.  The\n   primary target was\
    \ North American consumer to merchant electronic\n   commerce.\n"
- title: 2. Using The Fields
  contents:
  - "2. Using The Fields\n   To conform to this document, the field names shall be\
    \ as listed in\n   section 3 below.  Note: this does not impose any restriction\
    \ on the\n   user visible labeling of fields, just on their names as used in\n\
    \   communication with the merchant.\n"
- title: 2.1 Presentation of the Fields
  contents:
  - "2.1 Presentation of the Fields\n   There is no necessary implication as to the\
    \ order or manner of\n   presentation.  Some merchants may wish to ask for more\
    \ information,\n   some less by omitting fields.  Some merchants may ask for the\n\
    \   information they want in one HTML form on one web page, others may\n   ask\
    \ for parts of the information at different times on different\n   pages.  For\
    \ example, it is common to ask for \"ship to\" information\n   earlier, so shipping\
    \ cost can be computed, before the payment method\n   information.  Some merchants\
    \ may require that all the information\n   they request be provided while other\
    \ make much information optional,\n   etc.\n   There is no way with version 1\
    \ of ECML to indicate what fields the\n   merchant considers mandatory.  From\
    \ the point of view of customer\n   software, all fields are optional to complete.\
    \  However, the merchant\n   may give an error or re-present a request for information\
    \ if some\n   field it requires is not completed, just as it may if a field is\n\
    \   completed in a manner it considers erroneous.\n"
- title: 2.2 Methods and Flow of Setting the Fields
  contents:
  - "2.2 Methods and Flow of Setting the Fields\n   There are a variety of methods\
    \ of communication possible between the\n   customer and the merchant by which\
    \ the merchant can indicate what\n   fields they want that the consumer can provide.\
    \  Probably the easiest\n   to use for currently deployed software is as fields\
    \ in an HTML\n   [HTML4.0] form.  Other possibilities are to use the W3C P3P protocol\n\
    \   or the IOTP Authenticate transaction [IOTP].\n   User action or the appearance\
    \ of the Ecom_SchemaVersion field are\n   examples of triggers that could be used\
    \ to initiate a facility\n   capable of filling in fields.  It is required that\
    \ the\n   Ecom_SchemaVersion field, which is usually a hidden field, be\n   included\
    \ on every web page that has any \"Ecom_\" fields.\n   Because web pages can load\
    \ very slowly, it may not be clear to an\n   automated field fill-in function\
    \ when it is finished filling in\n   fields on a web page.  For this reason, it\
    \ is recommended that the\n   Ecom_SchemaVersion field be the last \"Ecom_\" field\
    \ on a web page.\n   Merchant requests for information can extend over several\
    \ web pages.\n   Without further provision, a facility could either require re-\n\
    \   starting on each page or possibly violate or appear to violate\n   privacy\
    \ by continuing to fill in fields for pages beyond with end of\n   the transaction\
    \ with a particular merchant.  For this reason the\n   Ecom_TransactionComplete\
    \ field, which is normally hidden, is\n   provided.  It is recommended that it\
    \ appear on the last web page\n   involved in a transaction, just before an Ecom_SchemaVersion\
    \ field,\n   so that multi-web-page automated field fill in logic could know when\n\
    \   to stop if it chooses to check for this field.\n"

  - "3. Field Definitions\n   The fields are listed below along with the minimum data\
    \ entry size to\n   allow.  Note that these fields are hierarchically organized\
    \ as\n   indicated by the embedded underscore (\"_\") characters.  Appropriate\n\
    \   consumer to merchant transmission mechanisms may use this to request\n   and\
    \ send aggregates, such as Ecom_Payment_Card_ExpDate to encompass\n   all the\
    \ date components or Ecom_ShipTo to encompass all the ship to\n   components that\
    \ the consumer is willing to provide.  The marshalling\n   and unmarshalling of\

  - "5. Security Considerations\n   The information called for by many of these fields\
    \ is sensitive and\n   should be protected if being sent over the public Internet\
    \ or through\n   other channels where it can be observed.  Mechanisms for such\n\
    \   protection are not specified herein but channel encryption such as\n   SSL/TLS\
    \ [RFC 2246] or IPSec [RFC 2411] would be appropriate in many\n   cases.\n   User\
    \ control over release of such information is needed to protect\n   the user's\
    \ privacy.\n   Any multi-web-page or other multi-aggregate field fill in or data\n\
    \   provision mechanism should check for the Ecom_TransactionComplete\n   field\
    \ and cease automated fill when it is encountered until fill is\n   further authorized.\n"
