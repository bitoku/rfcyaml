    \  Engineering (TE) node capabilities during Multi Protocol Label\n   Switching

    (TE-LSP) selection, such as, for instance, the\n   capability to act as a branch

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multi Protocol Label Switching-Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)
    routing\n   ([RFC3784], [RFC3630], [OSPFv3-TE]) relies on extensions to link\n
    \  state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) ([IS-IS], [RFC1195],\n   [RFC2328],
    [RFC2740]) in order to advertise Traffic Engineering (TE)\n   link information
    used for constraint-based routing.  Further\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) related
    routing extensions are defined in\n   [RFC4205] and [RFC4203].\n   It is desired
    to complement these routing extensions in order to\n   advertise TE node capabilities,
    in addition to TE link information.\n   These TE node capabilities will be taken
    into account as constraints\n   during path selection.\n   Indeed, it is useful
    to advertise data plane TE node capabilities,\n   such as the capability for a
    Label Switching Router (LSR) to be a\n   branch LSR or a bud-LSR of a Point-To-MultiPoint
    (P2MP) Label\n   Switched Path (LSP).  These capabilities can then be taken into\n
    \  account as constraints when computing the route of TE LSPs.\n   It is also
    useful to advertise control plane TE node capabilities\n   such as the capability
    to support GMPLS signaling for a packet LSR,\n   or the capability to support
    P2MP (Point to Multipoint) TE LSP\n   signaling.  This allows selecting a path
    that avoids nodes that do\n   not support a given control plane feature, or triggering
    a mechanism\n   to support such nodes on a path.  Hence, this facilitates backward\n
    \  compatibility.\n   For that purpose, this document specifies IGP (OSPF and
    IS-IS)\n   extensions in order to advertise data plane and control plane\n   capabilities
    of a node.\n   A new TLV is defined for OSPF, the TE Node Capability Descriptor
    TLV,\n   to be carried within the Router Information LSA ([RFC4970]).  A new\n
    \  sub-TLV is defined for IS-IS, the TE Node Capability Descriptor\n   sub-TLV,
    to be carried within the IS-IS Capability TLV ([RFC4971]).\n"
