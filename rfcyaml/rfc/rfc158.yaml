  - "Telnet Protocol\n   TELNET is a third-level protocol, the function of which is\
    \ to make a\n   terminal (or process) at a using site appear to the system or\
    \ a\n   process at a serving site as logically equivalent to a terminal\n   \"\
    directly\" connected to the serving site.  In performing this\n   function, the\
    \ protocol attempts to minimize the amount of information\n   each HOST must keep\
    \ about the characteristics of other HOSTS.\n   Definitions\n   Protocol Levels\
    \ (see Figure 1)\n      Level 1\n         HOST-IMP protocol specified by BBN in\
    \ NIC 5735, Specifications\n         for the Interconnection of a HOST and an\
    \ IMP (BBN Report 1822)\n      Level 2\n         HOST-HOST protocol performed\
    \ by NCPs as described in Document\n         Number 1 (NIC 5413) and subsequent\
    \ amendments, see RFC 107 (NIC\n         #5806)\n            One view of the NCP's\
    \ function is that it takes information\n            from the net and routes it\
    \ to receiving processes via\n            mechanisms internal to each HOST; conversely,\
    \ processes use\n            the NCP, via internal system calls, to have information\n\
    \            routed to other processes in the net (via the other\n           \
    \ processes' NCPs).\n      Level 3 (see Figure 2)\n         Level 3 is, by definition,\
    \ the place to which and from which\n         the NCP communicates internally\
    \ in its own host.\n            This level may be equivalent to the user process\
    \ level in\n            some systems, but this may not be the case in all systems.\n\
    \            In using sites, the TELNET process operates at this level.\n    \
    \        In serving sites, the TELNET server operates at this level.\n   Initial\
    \ Connection Protocol (ICP)\n      An agreed-upon sequence of level 3 exchanges\
    \ between two processes\n      which is, in general, used to synchronize the connection\
    \ dialogue\n      between the processes, e.g., RFC 80 (NIC #5608) #1, as revised\
    \ by\n      subsequent information.\n   Serving Site\n      The HOST into which\
    \ the TELNET process is directing the user's\n      keyboard input and from which\
    \ the TELNET process is receiving\n      control information and data effecting\
    \ the user's terminal.  At\n      the serving site, a TELNET server is executing.\n\
    \   Using Site\n      The HOST in which the TELNET process is executing.\n   Sending\
    \ Site\n      The HOST transmitting data, could be either using site or serving\n\
    \      site.\n   Receiving Site\n      Converse of sending site.\n   User\n  \
    \    The person or process \"driving\" the TELNET process.\n   In providing services\
    \ the TELNET protocol will use established\n   network conventions, specifically\
    \ the Network Control Program, and\n   Initial Connection Protocol referenced\
    \ in the above definitions,\n   using a byte size of 8 bits on the permanent connection.\n\
    \   The TELNET protocol provides for a Network Virtual Terminal (NVT)\n   through\
    \ which users may transmit and receive data over connections\n   between the using\
    \ site and the serving site.\n   The code of the NVT will be full 7 bit ASCII.\
    \  The seven-bit code\n   will be transmitted in eight-bit bytes, the high order\
    \ bit set to\n   zero.\n   It will be the responsibility of the using site to\
    \ provide its users\n   with a means of producing all 128 ASCII codes, as well\
    \ as a selected\n   set of special TELNET control signals (see Figure 3).\n  \
    \ The ASCII character ESC will be employed by the user as an escape\n   signal\
    \ indicating that the next character(s) has special meaning.\n   The meaning assigned\
    \ to escape code will be serving site defined and\n   therefore may not be consistant\
    \ across the network.\n   It will be the responsibility of the serving site to\
    \ specify for\n   users how the NVT code will be used to represent the codes normally\n\
    \   generated by a local terminal.  The serving sites specification of\n   this\
    \ representation is expected, where reasonable, to map on a one-\n   for-one basis\
    \ for ASCII graphics and controls that are provided\n   through local terminals.\
    \  The serving site will also specify how the\n   escape conventions will be interpreted\
    \ by the system.\n   The end of a line will be represented in the NVT as carriage\
    \ return\n   (X'0D') followed by line feed. (X'0A')\n   The protocol assumes that\
    \ initially the serving site will not provide\n   any echo to the using site.\n\
    \   Each TELNET control signal for which code must be sent over the\n   connection\
    \ will be represented in the NVT by an eight-bit code, with\n   the high order\
    \ bit set to one.  Following are the special codes\n   established to date. (U)\
    \ indicates that in most implementations the\n   user would be expected to have\
    \ the ability to signal the TELNET\n   process from his terminal to initiate the\
    \ code.\n   Code X'A0'\n      Source:  Both Sites (U)\n      Meaning: A DATA TYPE[1]\
    \ signal indicating that code will be\n               transmitted by NVT, i.e.,\
    \ using the seven-bit ASCII\n               conventions.\n   Code X'80'\n    \
    \  Source:  Using Site (U)\n      Meaning: Order using site NCP to send an INS\
    \ and insert X'80' in\n               data stream.\n   Code X'81'\n      Source:\
    \  Using Site (U)\n      Meaning: Break or Attention, and reverse break.\n   Code\
    \ X'82'\n      Source:  Both Sites\n      Meaning: No op\n   Code X'83'\n    \
    \  Source:  Both Sites\n      Meaning: Don't Echo\n   Code X'84'\n      Source:\
    \  Both Sites\n      Meaning: You Echo\n   Code X'85'\n      Source:  Serving\
    \ Site\n      Meaning: Hide your input [2]\n   Some special TELNET control signals\
    \ are required to permit the user\n   on some systems to send control information\
    \ to the using site TELNET\n   process[3].  These do not require a corresponding\
    \ control code for\n   transmission.  The local TELNET control signals are:\n\
    \      1. Transmit all data to this point.\n      2. Suppress transmission of\
    \ end of line, send all other data.\n   Data is to be forwarded to the NCP for\
    \ transmission as convenient,\n   but at least at the end of line, end of line\
    \ suppression, and\n   transmit signals.  If the normal line length of the sending\
    \ site is\n   greater than the allocation given by the receiving site, the sending\n\
    \   sites NCP, TELNET process, or TELNET server must be prepared to send\n   line\
    \ segments in convenient lengths until the full line has been\n   sent.\n   A\
    \ minimum implementation for TELNET for both using site and serving\n   site follows:\n\
    \      Using Site\n         1.)   Provide User (human or process) with ability\
    \ to cause all\n               128 ASCII codes to be transmitted in the required\
    \ 8 bit\n               field to the serving site.\n         2.)   Ignore (and\
    \ strip) all TELNET control characters received\n               from the serving\
    \ site.\n         3.)   Provide echo or local print capability to local user\n\
    \               terminals.\n         4.)   Provide for CR-LF end of line convention.\n\
    \         5.)   Implement local TELNET controls (See discussion above of\n   \
    \            local TELNET control signals) for transmit or suppress\n        \
    \       end of line.\n      Serving Site\n         1.)   Provide (and announce)\
    \ one for one mapping between ASCII\n               and Serving Site character\
    \ and control set (or if Serving\n               Site set greater than 128, a\
    \ sub set.)\n         2.)   Ignore (and strip) all TELNET control characters received\n\
    \               from the Using Site.\n         3.)   Assume Using Site will provide\
    \ local terminal echo or\n               print capability.\n         4.)   Provide\
    \ for CR-LF end of line convention.\n"

  - "Endnotes\n   [1] A one-byte DATA TYPE signal is sent as the first byte of data\n\
    \   over a connection.  A default is employed if the first byte over a\n   connection\
    \ has the high order bit set to zero, and it is assumed that\n   the seven-bit\
    \ ASCII NVT convention will be employed.  Most\n   implementations and applications\
    \ may expect the DATA TYPES to be\n   symmetrical at any point in time.  (i.e.\
    \ both using a serving site\n   using the same DATA TYPE.)  Other data types for\
    \ which codes are\n   currently assigned are:\n      X'A1'  Transparency\n   \
    \   X'A2'  EBCDIC\n      X'A3'  Special String to TELNET (I'll use your code)\n\
    \      X'A4'  End Special String to TELNET (I'll use my code)\n   [2] i.e. suppress\
    \ printing of password.\n   [3] In some cases, for prolonged [periods of special\
    \ treatment, local\n   implementation may dictate permitting the user to set a\
    \ \"mode\" to\n   prevail until explicitly discarded.\n          [This RFC was\
    \ put into machine readable form for entry]\n           [into the online RFC archives\
    \ by Lorrie Shiota 2/02]\n"
