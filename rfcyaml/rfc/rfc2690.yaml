  - "2. Cover Letter\n   This is a copy of the cover letter that was used to submit\
    \ the draft\n   to ICANN.\n   Dear Esther,\n           Enclosed please find a\
    \ description of a proposed Protocol\n   Support Organization (PSO) for ICANN's\
    \ consideration.  This\n   description is purposefully informal as it is meant\
    \ to be a basis for\n   discussion and not a final formal legal document.\n  \
    \         This proposal was developed primarily by using the open\n   Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force (IETF) poisson working group mailing\n   list to discuss\
    \ successive versions of the proposal.  In addition the\n   proposal has benefited\
    \ from extensive discussion within the IETF's\n   Internet Engineering Steering\
    \ Group (IESG) and Internet Architecture\n   Board (IAB).  The proposal also benefited\
    \ from extended discussions\n   with representatives of the International Telecommunication\
    \ Union\n   (ITU) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n           I look\
    \ forward to ICANN's evaluation of this proposal and am\n   also looking forward\
    \ to the MOU development meeting  noted in section\n   1.c of the proposal.\n\
    \   Thanks\n   Scott\n"

  - "3. Proposal for a MOU-based PSO\n                     ICANN Protocol Supporting\
    \ Organization\n   1. Definition of the PSO.\n      a. Purpose.\n         The\
    \ Protocol Support Organization (PSO) will be a consensus-\n         based advisory\
    \ body within the ICANN framework.\n      b. Components.\n         The PSO will\
    \ establish a \"Protocol Council\" and host an annual\n         open meeting (known\
    \ as the \"General Assembly\" (described\n         below)).\n      c. Creation\
    \ through a Memorandum of Understanding.\n         Arrangements regarding the\
    \ PSO are to be reflected in a\n         Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) among\
    \ ICANN and a group of\n         open international Internet related standards\
    \ development\n         organizations (SDOs). SDOs must satisfy a set of objective\n\
    \         criteria before they can be considered for membership. (see\n      \
    \   Appendix A) After ICANN has accepted a proposal for an ICANN\n         PSO,\
    \ including the SDO criteria, a meeting, open to all SDOs\n         that believe\
    \ they meet the criteria, will be held to develop\n         the MOU.\n       \
    \  All existing MOU signatories must agree to the admission of new\n         signatories.\
    \ Rejected applicants can appeal to the ICANN Board\n         where a 2/3rds majority\
    \ can override such a rejection if the\n         board finds the SDO meets the\
    \ criteria.\n   2. The Protocol Council\n      a. Members\n         The Protocol\
    \ Council will have up to [12] individual members\n         selected by the SDO\
    \ signatories of the MOU. (see below)\n      b. Term\n         The term of Protocol\
    \ Council members will be 2 years. Removal\n         will be pursuant to procedures\
    \ established through the MOU.\n         (Initial terms will be 1 and 2 years\
    \ to provide initial\n         conditions for staggered terms.)\n      c. Powers/Duties\
    \ of the Protocol Council\n         i   Appointment of ICANN Directors\n     \
    \        The Protocol Council will nominate 3 Directors to the ICANN\n       \
    \      Board (By-laws, Art. V, Sec. 4(iii)). The initial directors\n         \
    \    would have terms of 1, 2 and 3 years (By-laws, Art. V, Sec.\n           \
    \  9(d)\n             The Protocol Council will conduct an open call for\n   \
    \          nominations for any open PSO seats on the ICANN board. Each\n     \
    \        SDO signatory to the MOU is entitled to nominate candidates\n       \
    \      by procedures of its own choosing. Additionally,\n             nominations\
    \ from the public at large should be allowed\n             under conditions to\
    \ be defined by the Protocol Council.\n             The Protocol Council will\
    \ select the PSO nominees to the\n             ICANN board from among these nominees\
    \ by a means of its own\n             choosing.\n         ii  Qualifications of\
    \ ICANN Directors\n             No more than 2 PSO-nominated Directors may come\
    \ from the\n             same geographic region.\n         iii Role of ICANN Directors\n\
    \             The Directors appointed by the Protocol Council will not\n     \
    \        represent the PSO on the Board, but will function as full\n         \
    \    Directors of ICANN.  (By-laws, Art. V, Sec. 8)\n         iv  Advisory Role\n\
    \             The Protocol Council will advise the Board of ICANN on\n       \
    \      matters referred to the Protocol Council by the ICANN\n             Board.\
    \ As per the ICANN By-laws, only matters relating to\n             the assignment\
    \ of parameters for Internet protocols would\n             be so referred.\n \
    \     d. Policy Development\n         In the tradition of the Internet, standards\
    \ development\n         policies and conflict resolution mechanisms should be\
    \ created\n         by those institutions most directly involved, without undue\n\
    \         interference from centralized bodies.\n         The ICANN By-laws vest\
    \ in the PSO the primary responsibility\n         for developing and recommending\
    \ substantive policies in the\n         area of protocol parameter assignment.\
    \  The PSO is committed to\n         the proposition that policies for parameter\
    \ assignments for\n         particular protocols are the responsibility of the\
    \ individual\n         SDO that developed the protocol. The Protocol Council will\
    \ be\n         available as needed by the SDOs to develop policies and\n     \
    \    procedures for conflict resolution between SDOs. (By-laws, New\n        \
    \ Art. VI, Sec. 2(b)). Any policies must be adopted by consensus\n         of\
    \ all SDOs.  The ICANN Board of Directors will take no\n         addition action\
    \ regarding disputes between SDOs related to\n         protocol assignment or\
    \ registration.\n   3. Annual Open Meeting (General Assembly)\n      a. Hosting\
    \ an open meeting\n         The Protocol Council will periodically host an open\
    \ meeting\n         (\"General Assembly\") for promoting discussion and receiving\n\
    \         input regarding the work of the PSO. A General Assembly meeting\n  \
    \       will be held at least once per year, and will permit open\n         participation\
    \ by all interested individuals.\n         The annual open meeting will be held\
    \ in conjunction with a\n         major meeting of one of the SDOs that have signed\
    \ the MOU.\n         (with an effort to hold no 2 consecutive meetings in the\
    \ same\n         geographic region.\n         It is expected that the major SDOs\
    \ within the Internet protocol\n         standards development community will\
    \ provide the constituency\n         of the General Assembly.\n      b. Selection\
    \ of Protocol Council Members\n         Prior to the annual open meeting, the\
    \ Protocol Council shall\n         make an open call for nominations to the upcoming\
    \ vacancies in\n         the Protocol Council. Each SDO signatory to the PSO MOU\
    \ will be\n         entitled to make nominations for some or all of the vacant\n\
    \         seats by a procedure of its own choosing. In the event that\n      \
    \   there are more nominees than vacancies, an election will be\n         held\
    \ in which each SDO signatory to the PSO MOU has equal votes.\n         Protocol\
    \ Council Members should fairly represent, to the extent\n         reasonable,\
    \ all constituencies within the member SDOs,\n         including the major technical\
    \ areas and geographical regions.\n   4. Open Proceedings and Documents\n    \
    \  a. Communications between ICANN and the PSO\n         All communications between\
    \ ICANN and the PSO will be made\n         public on the PSO web site. In the\
    \ event that ICANN requests\n         that a communication be kept confidential,\
    \ the PSO will honor\n         this request for a fixed period of time not to\
    \ exceed one year,\n         and then make the communication public.\n      b.\
    \ PSO Proceedings\n         All discussions of PSO business will be conducted\
    \ on a\n         publicly-archived mailing list accessible through the PSO web\n\
    \         site. The schedule for the PSO meetings will be posted 90 days\n   \
    \      in advance of the meeting date. The agenda for the Protocol\n         Council\
    \ and annual open meetings will be posted on the PSO web\n         site at least\
    \ 30 days before the meetings.  The minutes from\n         all PSO meetings will\
    \ be publicly posted on the PSO web site\n         within 30 days of the meeting.\n\
    \   5. Review of MOU\n      The MOU signatories will periodically review the results\
    \ and\n      consequences of their cooperation under the MOU. When appropriate,\n\
    \      the signatories will consider the need for improvements in the MOU\n  \
    \    and make suitable proposals for modifying and updating the\n      arrangements\
    \ and scope of the MOU.\n   6. Recognition\n      ICANN will officially recognize\
    \ the PSO described in this memo as\n      the PSO under the ICANN By-laws Art.\
    \ 6, Sec. 3.\n"
