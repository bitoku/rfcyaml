  - "1.  Introduction\n   TRILL supports multicast forwarding.  Applications based
    on TRILL\n   multicast may need quick detection of multicast failures using P2MP\n
    \  BFD [RFC8562].  This document specifies TRILL support of P2MP BFD.\n   To use
    P2MP BFD, the head end needs to periodically transmit BFD\n   Control packets
    to all tails using TRILL multicast.  A new RBridge\n   Channel message is allocated
    for this purpose.\n   In order to execute the global protection of distribution
    used for\n   multicast forwarding [TRILL-TREES], the head needs to track the\n
    \  active status of tails [RFC8563].  If the tail loses connectivity as\n   detected
    by not receiving the new RBridge Channel message from the\n   head, the tail should
    notify the head of the lack of multipoint\n   connectivity with unicast BFD Control
    packets.  These unicast BFD\n   Control packets are transmitted using the existing
    RBridge Channel\n   message assigned to BFD Control [RFC7175].\n   This document
    updates [RFC7177] as specified in Section 3 and updates\n   [RFC7175] as specified
    in Sections 4 and 5.\n"

  - "3.  Bootstrapping\n   The TRILL adjacency mechanism bootstraps the establishment
    of one-\n   hop TRILL BFD sessions [RFC7177].  Multi-hop sessions are expected
    to\n   be configured by the network manager.  A slight wording update to the\n
    \  second sentence in Section 6 of [RFC7177] is required.\n   It currently reads:\n
    \     If an RBridge supports BFD [RFC7175], it will have learned whether\n      the
    other RBridge has BFD enabled by whether or not a BFD-Enabled\n      TLV [RFC6213]
    was included in its Hellos.\n   Now it should read:\n      If an RBridge supports
    BFD (see [RFC7175] and [RFC8564]), it will\n      have learned whether the other
    RBridge has BFD enabled by whether\n      or not a BFD-Enabled TLV [RFC6213] was
    included in its Hellos.\n   In addition, a normative reference to this document
    is added to RFC\n   7177 as a result of this update.\n"
  title: 3.  Bootstrapping
- contents:
  - "4.  A New RBridge Channel Message for P2MP BFD\n   RBridge Channel protocol number
    0x002 is defined for TRILL point-to-\n   point BFD Control packets in [RFC7175].
    \ That RFC states that if the\n   M bit of the TRILL Header of the RBridge Channel
    packet containing a\n   BFD Control packet is nonzero, the packet is generally
    dropped.  In\n   P2MP BFD, the head is required to probe tails using multicast.
    \ This\n   means the M bit will be set to 1.  For this reason, a new RBridge\n
    \  Channel message (P2MP BFD Control), whose protocol code point is\n   0x007,
    is specified in this document.  An RBridge that supports P2MP\n   BFD MUST support
    the new RBridge Channel message for P2MP BFD.  The\n   capability to support the
    RBridge Channel message for P2MP BFD, and\n   therefore support performing P2MP
    BFD, is announced within the\n   RBridge Channel Protocols sub-TLV in Link State
    PDUs (LSPs)\n   [RFC7176].\n   As specified in [RFC7178], when the tail receives
    TRILL Data packets\n   sent as BFD RBridge Channel messages, it will absorb the
    packets\n   itself rather than deliver these packets to its attached end\n   stations.\n"
  title: 4.  A New RBridge Channel Message for P2MP BFD
- contents:
  - "5.  Discriminators and Packet Demultiplexing\n   The processing in Section 3.2
    of [RFC7175] generally applies except\n   that the test on the M bit in the TRILL
    Header is reversed.  If the M\n   bit is zero, the packet MUST be discarded.  If
    the M bit is one, it\n   is processed.\n   After the processing per Section 3.2
    of [RFC7175], the tail\n   demultiplexes incoming BFD packets based on a combination
    of the\n   source address and My Discriminator as specified in [RFC8562].  In\n
    \  addition to this combination, TRILL P2MP BFD requires that the tail\n   use
    the Data Label, which is either the inner VLAN or the Fine-\n   Grained Label
    [RFC7172], for demultiplexing.  If the tail needs to\n   notify the head about
    the failure of a multipath, the tail is\n   required to send unicast BFD Control
    packets using the same Data\n   Label as used by the head.\n"

- contents:
  - "6.  Tracking Active Tails\n   According to [RFC8562], the head has a session
    of type MultipointHead\n   that is bound to a multipoint path.  Multipoint BFD
    Control packets\n   are sent by this session over the multipoint path, and no
    BFD Control\n   packets are received by it.  Each tail dynamically creates a\n
    \  MultipointTail per a multipoint path.  MultipointTail sessions\n   receive
    BFD Control packets from the head over multipoint paths.\n   An example use is
    when a multicast tree root needs to keep track of\n   all the receivers as in
    [TRILL-TREES]; this can be done by\n   maintaining a session of type MultipointClient
    per receiver that is\n   of interest, as described in [RFC8563].  See [RFC8563]
    for detailed\n   operations of tracking active tails.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Multipoint BFD provides its own authentication
    but does not provide\n   encryption (see the Security Considerations in [RFC8562]).
    \ As\n   specified in this document, the point-to-multipoint BFD payloads are\n
    \  encapsulated in RBridge Channel messages that have been extended by\n   [RFC7978]
    to provide security.  [RFC7978] provides encryption only\n   for point-to-point
    extended RBridge Channel messages, so its\n   encryption facilities are not applicable
    to this document.  However,\n   [RFC7978] provides stronger authentication than
    that currently\n   provided in BFD.  Thus, there is little reason to use the BFD\n
    \  security mechanisms if authentication per [RFC7978] is in use.  It is\n   expected
    that a future TRILL document will provide for group keying;\n   when that occurs,
    the use of RBridge Channel security [RFC7978] will\n   be able to provide both
    encryption and authentication.\n   For general multipoint BFD security considerations,
    see [RFC8562].\n   For general RBridge Channel security considerations, see [RFC7178].\n"
