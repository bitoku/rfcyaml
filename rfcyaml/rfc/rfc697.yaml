    \ support a \"files only\" directory.  This type of\ndirectory cannot be \"logged\
    \ in\" but it can be \"connected to\".  A login\ngives directory \"owner\" access\
    \ to the job generated by the system and an\naddress space in which the user can\
    \ execute programs.   A connect allows\nan existing job and its associated user\
    \ \"owner\" access to a directory\nbut creates no address space.  The words \"\
    owner\", \"group\", and\n\"universal\" or \"public\" determine which field of\
    \ the protection\nspecification is to be used to check the legality of a file\
    \ access\nrequest.\nProblem\nThe Tenex FTP server does not allow an FTP Login\
    \ to a \"files only\"\ndirectory.  The current protocol contains the CWD (Change\
    \ Working\nDirectory) command which gets part of the \"connect\" functions but\
    \ it\ndoes not grant \"owner\" access to the user.  Therefore, there is no way\
    \ a\nuser can access a \"files only\" directory as the \"owner\" (i.e. he can\n\
    supply the password).  This is undesirable for private directories of\nthis type\
    \ since it is uneconomical to define a user - directory \"group\"\nfor so few\
    \ directories and unrestricted \"public\" access may be\nundesirable.\nSolution\n\
    There are two approach we can take.  Either we remove the distinction\n\"files\
    \ only\" from the FTP login, or we create a command that does the\n\"connect\"\
    \ function.  The restriction placed on \"files only\" directories\nis based on\
    \ how we define a user of FTP to the server.  If we say that\nany net user who\
    \ knows the password to a directory has ownership of that\ndirectory as far as\
    \ FTP is concerned, then we have a solution.  If we\nwant an FTP login to be as\
    \ restrictive as a user login, then we need the\nsecond alternative.\nProposal\n\
    Change the protocol in one of the following ways:\n1.  Remove the restriction\
    \ on \"files only\" directories for FTP logins or\n2.  Add an optional argument\
    \ to the CWD (Change Working Directory)\n    command to specify the password string\
    \ for the directory.  If the\n    password check is successful the user is granted\
    \ ownership rights to\n    that directory.  If the password is not present or\
    \ the check fails,\n    the command functions as it presently does and access\
    \ is controlled\n    by the current protection mechanism.  Anonymous users should\
    \ not be\n    allowed to use this mechanism to change their access to the file\n\
    \    system.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n\
