- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In recent times, networked electronic devices have found\
    \ an\n   increasing number of applications in various fields.  Yet, for\n   reasons\
    \ ranging from operational application to economics, these\n   wired and wireless\
    \ devices are often supplied with minimum physical\n   resources; the constraints\
    \ include those on computational resources\n   (RAM, clock speed, and storage)\
    \ and communication resources (duty\n   cycle, packet size, etc.) but also form\
    \ factors that may rule out\n   user-access interfaces (e.g., the housing of a\
    \ small stick-on switch)\n   or simply safety considerations (e.g., with gas meters).\
    \  As a\n   consequence, the resulting networks are more prone to loss of traffic\n\
    \   and other vulnerabilities.  The proliferation of these Low-Power and\n   Lossy\
    \ Networks (LLNs), however, are drawing efforts to examine and\n   address their\
    \ potential networking challenges.  Securing the\n   establishment and maintenance\
    \ of network connectivity among these\n   deployed devices becomes one of these\
    \ key challenges.\n   This document presents a threat analysis for securing the\
    \ Routing\n   Protocol for LLNs (RPL).  The process requires two steps.  First,\
    \ the\n   analysis will be used to identify pertinent security issues.  The\n\
    \   second step is to identify necessary countermeasures to secure RPL.\n   As\
    \ there are multiple ways to solve the problem and the specific\n   trade-offs\
    \ are deployment specific, the specific countermeasure to be\n   used is detailed\
    \ in applicability statements.\n   This document uses a model based on [ISO.7498-2.1989],\
    \ which\n   describes authentication, access control, data confidentiality, data\n\
    \   integrity, and non-repudiation security services.  This document\n   expands\
    \ the model to include the concept of availability.  As\n   explained below, non-repudiation\
    \ does not apply to routing protocols.\n   Many of the issues in this document\
    \ were also covered in the IAB\n   Smart Object Workshop [RFC6574] and the IAB\
    \ Smart Object Security\n   Workshop [RFC7397].\n   This document concerns itself\
    \ with securing the control-plane\n   traffic.  As such, it does not address authorization\
    \ or\n   authentication of application traffic.  RPL uses multicast as part of\n\
    \   its protocol; therefore, mechanisms that RPL uses to secure this\n   traffic\
    \ might also be applicable to the Multicast Protocol for Low-\n   Power and Lossy\
    \ Networks (MPL) control traffic as well: the important\n   part is that the threats\
    \ are similar.\n"

- title: 4.  Considerations on RPL Security
  contents:
  - "4.  Considerations on RPL Security\n   Routing security, in essence, ensures\
    \ that the routing protocol\n   operates correctly.  It entails implementing measures\
    \ to ensure\n   controlled state changes on devices and network elements, both\
    \ based\n   on external inputs (received via communications) or internal inputs\n\
    \   (physical security of the device itself and parameters maintained by\n   the\
    \ device, including, e.g., clock).  State changes would thereby\n   involve not\
    \ only authorization of the injector's actions,\n   authentication of injectors,\
    \ and potentially confidentiality of\n   routing data, but also proper order of\
    \ state changes through\n   timeliness, since seriously delayed state changes,\
    \ such as commands\n   or updates of routing tables, may negatively impact system\
    \ operation.\n   A security assessment can, therefore, begin with a focus on the\n\
    \   assets [RFC4949] that may be the target of the state changes and the\n   access\
    \ points in terms of interfaces and protocol exchanges through\n   which such\
    \ changes may occur.  In the case of routing security, the\n   focus is directed\
    \ towards the elements associated with the\n   establishment and maintenance of\
    \ network connectivity.\n   This section sets the stage for the development of\
    \ the analysis by\n   applying the systematic approach proposed in [Myagmar2005]\
    \ to the\n   routing security, while also drawing references from other reviews\n\
    \   and assessments found in the literature, particularly [RFC4593] and\n   [Karlof2003]\
    \ (i.e., selective forwarding, wormhole, and sinkhole\n   attacks).  The subsequent\
    \ subsections begin with a focus on the\n   elements of a generic routing process\
    \ that is used to establish\n   routing assets and points of access to the routing\
    \ functionality.\n   Next, the security model based on [ISO.7498-2.1989] is briefly\n\
    \   described.  Then, consideration is given to issues specific to or\n   amplified\
    \ in LLNs.  This section concludes with the formulation of a\n   set of security\
    \ objectives for RPL.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Routing Assets and Points of Access
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Routing Assets and Points of Access\n   An asset is an important system\
    \ resource (including information,\n   process, or physical resource); the access\
    \ to and corruption or loss\n   of an asset adversely affects the system.  In\
    \ the control-plane\n   context, an asset is information about the network, processes\
    \ used to\n   manage and manipulate this data, and the physical devices on which\n\
    \   this data is stored and manipulated.  The corruption or loss of these\n  \
    \ assets may adversely impact the control plane of the network.  Within\n   the\
    \ same context, a point of access is an interface or protocol that\n   facilitates\
    \ interaction between control-plane assets.  Identifying\n   these assets and\
    \ points of access will provide a basis for\n   enumerating the attack surface\
    \ of the control plane.\n   A level-0 data flow diagram [Yourdon1979] is used\
    \ here to identify\n   the assets and points of access within a generic routing\
    \ process.\n   The use of a data flow diagram allows for a clear and concise model\n\
    \   of the way in which routing nodes interact and process information;\n   hence,\
    \ it provides a context for threats and attacks.  The goal of\n   the model is\
    \ to be as detailed as possible so that corresponding\n   assets, points of access,\
    \ and processes in an individual routing\n   protocol can be readily identified.\n\
    \   Figure 1 shows that nodes participating in the routing process\n   transmit\
    \ messages to discover neighbors and to exchange routing\n   information; routes\
    \ are then generated and stored, which may be\n   maintained in the form of the\
    \ protocol forwarding table.  The nodes\n   use the derived routes for making\
    \ forwarding decisions.\n                    ...................................................\n\

    \ against unauthorized use of\n         the asset and deals with the authorization\
    \ of a node.\n   Confidentiality\n         Confidentiality involves the protection\
    \ of routing information\n         as well as routing neighbor maintenance exchanges\
    \ so that only\n         authorized and intended network entities may view or\
    \ access it.\n         Because LLNs are most commonly found on a publicly accessible\n\
    \         shared medium, e.g., air or wiring in a building, and are\n        \
    \ sometimes formed ad hoc, confidentiality also extends to the\n         neighbor\
    \ state and database information within the routing\n         device since the\
    \ deployment of the network creates the\n         potential for unauthorized access\
    \ to the physical devices\n         themselves.\n   Integrity\n         Integrity\
    \ entails the protection of routing information and\n         routing neighbor\
    \ maintenance exchanges, as well as derived\n         information maintained in\
    \ the database, from unauthorized\n         modifications, insertions, deletions,\
    \ or replays to be\n         addressed beyond the routing protocol.\n   Non-repudiation\n\
    \         Non-repudiation is the assurance that the transmission and/or\n    \
    \     reception of a message cannot later be denied.  The service of\n       \
    \  non-repudiation applies after the fact; thus, it relies on the\n         logging\
    \ or other capture of ongoing message exchanges and\n         signatures.  Routing\
    \ protocols typically do not have a notion\n         of repudiation, so non-repudiation\
    \ services are not required.\n         Further, with the LLN application domains\
    \ as described in\n         [RFC5867] and [RFC5548], proactive measures are much\
    \ more\n         critical than retrospective protections.  Finally, given the\n\
    \         significant practical limits to ongoing routing transaction\n      \
    \   logging and storage and individual device digital signature\n         verification\
    \ for each exchange, non-repudiation in the context\n         of routing is an\
    \ unsupportable burden that bears no further\n         consideration as an RPL\
    \ security issue.\n   It is recognized that, besides those security issues captured\
    \ in the\n   ISO 7498-2 model, availability is a security requirement:\n   Availability\n\
    \         Availability ensures that routing information exchanges and\n      \
    \   forwarding services are available when they are required for\n         the\
    \ functioning of the serving network.  Availability will\n         apply to maintaining\
    \ efficient and correct operation of routing\n         and neighbor discovery\
    \ exchanges (including needed information)\n         and forwarding services so\
    \ as not to impair or limit the\n         network's central traffic flow function.\n\
    \   It should be emphasized here that for RPL security, the above\n   requirements\
    \ must be complemented by the proper security policies and\n   enforcement mechanisms\
    \ to ensure that security objectives are met by\n   a given RPL implementation.\n"

  - "4.3.  Issues Specific to or Amplified in LLNs\n   The requirements work detailed\
    \ in Urban Requirements [RFC5548],\n   Industrial Requirements [RFC5673], Home\
    \ Automation [RFC5826], and\n   Building Automation [RFC5867] have identified\
    \ specific issues and\n   constraints of routing in LLNs.  The following is a\
    \ list of\n   observations from those requirements and evaluations of their impact\n\
    \   on routing security considerations.\n   Limited energy, memory, and processing\
    \ node resources\n         As a consequence of these constraints, the need to\
    \ evaluate the\n         kinds of security that can be provided needs careful\
    \ study.\n         For instance, security provided at one level could be very\n\
    \         memory efficient yet might also be very energy costly for the\n    \
    \     network (as a whole) if it requires significant effort to\n         synchronize\
    \ the security state.  Synchronization of security\n         states with sleepy\
    \ nodes [RFC7102] is a complex issue.  A non-\n         rechargeable battery-powered\
    \ node may well be limited in energy\n         for it's lifetime: once exhausted,\
    \ it may well never function\n         again.\n   Large scale of rolled out network\n\
    \         The possibly numerous nodes to be deployed make manual on-site\n   \
    \      configuration unlikely.  For example, an urban deployment can\n       \
    \  see several hundreds of thousands of nodes being installed by\n         many\
    \ installers with a low level of expertise.  Nodes may be\n         installed\
    \ and not activated for many years, and additional\n         nodes may be added\
    \ later on, which may be from old inventory.\n         The lifetime of the network\
    \ is measured in decades, and this\n         complicates the operation of key\
    \ management.\n   Autonomous operations\n         Self-forming and self-organizing\
    \ are commonly prescribed\n         requirements of LLNs.  In other words, a routing\
    \ protocol\n         designed for LLNs needs to contain elements of ad hoc\n \
    \        networking and, in most cases, cannot rely on manual\n         configuration\
    \ for initialization or local filtering rules.\n         Network topology/ownership\
    \ changes, partitioning or merging,\n         and node replacement can all contribute\
    \ to complicating the\n         operations of key management.\n   Highly directional\
    \ traffic\n         Some types of LLNs see a high percentage of their total traffic\n\
    \         traverse between the nodes and the LLN Border Routers (LBRs)\n     \
    \    where the LLNs connect to non-LLNs.  The special routing status\n       \
    \  of and the greater volume of traffic near the LBRs have routing\n         security\
    \ consequences as a higher-valued attack target.  In\n         fact, when Point-to-MultiPoint\
    \ (P2MP) and MultiPoint-to-Point\n         (MP2P) traffic represents a majority\
    \ of the traffic, routing\n         attacks consisting of advertising incorrect\
    \ preferred routes\n         can cause serious damage.\n         While it might\
    \ seem that nodes higher up in the acyclic graph\n         (i.e., those with lower\
    \ rank) should be secured in a stronger\n         fashion, it is not, in general,\
    \ easy to predict which nodes\n         will occupy those positions until after\
    \ deployment.  Issues of\n         redundancy and inventory control suggest that\
    \ any node might\n         wind up in such a sensitive attack position, so all\
    \ nodes are\n         to be capable of being fully secured.\n         In addition,\
    \ even if it were possible to predict which nodes\n         will occupy positions\
    \ of lower rank and provision them with\n         stronger security mechanisms,\
    \ in the absence of a strong\n         authorization model, any node could advertise\
    \ an incorrect\n         preferred route.\n   Unattended locations and limited\
    \ physical security\n         In many applications, the nodes are deployed in\
    \ unattended or\n         remote locations; furthermore, the nodes themselves\
    \ are often\n         built with minimal physical protection.  These constraints\n\
    \         lower the barrier of accessing the data or security material\n     \
    \    stored on the nodes through physical means.\n   Support for mobility\n  \
    \       On the one hand, only a limited number of applications require\n     \
    \    the support of mobile nodes, e.g., a home LLN that includes\n         nodes\
    \ on wearable health care devices or an industry LLN that\n         includes nodes\
    \ on cranes and vehicles.  On the other hand, if a\n         routing protocol\
    \ is indeed used in such applications, it will\n         clearly need to have\
    \ corresponding security mechanisms.\n         Additionally, nodes may appear\
    \ to move from one side of a wall\n         to another without any actual motion\
    \ involved, which is the\n         result of changes to electromagnetic properties,\
    \ such as the\n         opening and closing of a metal door.\n   Support for multicast\
    \ and anycast\n         Support for multicast and anycast is called out chiefly\
    \ for\n         large-scale networks.  Since application of these routing\n  \
    \       mechanisms in autonomous operations of many nodes is new, the\n      \
    \   consequence on security requires careful consideration.\n   The above list\
    \ considers how an LLN's physical constraints, size,\n   operations, and variety\
    \ of application areas may impact security.\n   However, it is the combinations\
    \ of these factors that particularly\n   stress the security concerns.  For instance,\
    \ securing routing for a\n   large number of autonomous devices that are left\
    \ in unattended\n   locations with limited physical security presents challenges\
    \ that are\n   not found in the common circumstance of administered networked\n\
    \   routers.  The following subsection sets up the security objectives\n   for\
    \ the routing protocol designed by the ROLL WG.\n"
- title: 4.4.  RPL Security Objectives
  contents:
  - "4.4.  RPL Security Objectives\n   This subsection applies the ISO 7498-2 model\
    \ to routing assets and\n   access points, taking into account the LLN issues,\
    \ to develop a set\n   of RPL security objectives.\n   Since the fundamental function\
    \ of a routing protocol is to build\n   routes for forwarding packets, it is essential\
    \ to ensure that:\n   o  routing/topology information integrity remains intact\
    \ during\n      transfer and in storage;\n   o  routing/topology information is\
    \ used by authorized entities; and\n   o  routing/topology information is available\
    \ when needed.\n   In conjunction, it is necessary to be assured that:\n   o \
    \ Authorized peers authenticate themselves during the routing\n      neighbor\
    \ discovery process.\n   o  The routing/topology information received is generated\
    \ according\n      to the protocol design.\n   However, when trust cannot be fully\
    \ vested through authentication of\n   the principals alone, i.e., concerns of\
    \ an insider attack, assurance\n   of the truthfulness and timeliness of the received\
    \ routing/topology\n   information is necessary.  With regard to confidentiality,\
    \ protecting\n   the routing/topology information from unauthorized exposure may\
    \ be\n   desirable in certain cases but is in itself less pertinent, in\n   general,\
    \ to the routing function.\n   One of the main problems of synchronizing security\
    \ states of sleepy\n   nodes, as listed in the last subsection, lies in difficulties\
    \ in\n   authentication; these nodes may not have received the most recent\n \
    \  update of security material in time.  Similarly, the issues of\n   minimal\
    \ manual configuration, prolonged rollout and delayed addition\n   of nodes, and\
    \ network topology changes also complicate key\n   management.  Hence, routing\
    \ in LLNs needs to bootstrap the\n   authentication process and allow for a flexible\
    \ expiration scheme of\n   authentication credentials.\n   The vulnerability brought\
    \ forth by some special-function nodes, e.g.,\n   LBRs, requires the assurance,\
    \ particularly in a security context, of\n   the following:\n   o  The availability\
    \ of communication channels and node resources.\n   o  The neighbor discovery\
    \ process operates without undermining\n      routing availability.\n   There\
    \ are other factors that are not part of RPL but directly affect\n   its function.\
    \  These factors include a weaker barrier of accessing\n   the data or security\
    \ material stored on the nodes through physical\n   means; therefore, the internal\
    \ and external interfaces of a node need\n   to be adequate for guarding the integrity,\
    \ and possibly the\n   confidentiality, of stored information, as well as the\
    \ integrity of\n   routing and route generation processes.\n   Each individual\
    \ system's use and environment will dictate how the\n   above objectives are applied,\
    \ including the choices of security\n   services as well as the strengths of the\
    \ mechanisms that must be\n   implemented.  The next two sections take a closer\
    \ look at how the RPL\n   security objectives may be compromised and how those\
    \ potential\n   compromises can be countered.\n"

    \ under the ISO\n   7498-2 model and highlights the specific attacks in each of\
    \ these\n   categories for RPL.  As defined in [RFC4949], a threat is \"a\n  \
    \ potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a\n   circumstance,\
    \ capability, action, or event that could breach security\n   and cause harm.\"\
    \n   Per [RFC3067], an attack is \"an assault on system security that\n   derives\
    \ from an intelligent threat, i.e., an intelligent act that is\n   a deliberate\
    \ attempt (especially in the sense of a method or\n   technique) to evade security\
    \ services and violate the security policy\n   of a system.\"\n   The subsequent\
    \ subsections consider the threats and the attacks that\n   can cause security\
    \ breaches under the ISO 7498-2 model to the routing\n   assets and via the routing\
    \ points of access identified in\n   Section 4.1.  The assessment reviews the\
    \ security concerns of each\n   routing asset and looks at the attacks that can\
    \ exploit routing\n   points of access.  The threats and attacks identified are\
    \ based on\n   the routing model analysis and associated review of the existing\n\
    \   literature.  The source of the attacks is assumed to be from either\n   inside\
    \ or outside attackers.  While some attackers inside the network\n   will be using\
    \ compromised nodes and, therefore, are only able to do\n   what an ordinary node\
    \ can (\"node-equivalent\"), other attacks may not\n   be limited in memory, CPU,\
    \ power consumption, or long-term storage.\n   Moore's law favors the attacker\
    \ with access to the latest\n   capabilities, while the defenders will remain\
    \ in place for years to\n   decades.\n"

    \ interface.\n   A prerequisite to countering this attack is to ensure that the\n\
    \   communicating nodes are authenticated prior to data encryption\n   applied\
    \ in the routing exchange.  The authentication ensures that the\n   LLN starts\

    \ L2 and/or L3 routing\n   information that must remain unencrypted to permit\
    \ network routing.\n   One way in which passive traffic-analysis attacks can be\

    \   generally support multipath routing within a single DODAG.  Multiple\n   DODAGs\
    \ are supported in the protocol, and an implementation could\n   make use of that.\
    \  RPL does not have any inherent or standard way to\n   guarantee that the different\

    \    system operation characteristics; and\n   o  allow only trusted data to be\
    \ received and forwarded.\n   As for the first one, a simple approach to minimize\
    \ the harmful\n   impact of an overload attack is to introduce traffic quotas.\
    \  This\n   prevents a malicious node from injecting a large amount of traffic\n\
    \   into the network, even though it does not prevent the said node from\n   injecting\
    \ irrelevant traffic at all.  Another method is to isolate\n   nodes from the\
    \ network at the network layer once it has been detected\n   that more traffic\
    \ is injected into the network than allowed by a\n   prior set or dynamically\
    \ adjusted threshold.  Finally, if\n   communication is sufficiently secured,\
    \ only trusted nodes can receive\n   and forward traffic, which also lowers the\
    \ risk of an overload\n   attack.\n   Receiving nodes that validate signatures\
    \ and sending nodes that\n   encrypt messages need to be cautious of cryptographic\
    \ processing\n   usage when validating signatures and encrypting messages.  Where\n\
    \   feasible, certificates should be validated prior to use of the\n   associated\
    \ keys to counter potential resource overloading attacks.\n   The associated design\
    \ decision needs to also consider that the\n   validation process requires resources;\
    \ thus, it could be exploited\n   for attacks.  Alternatively, resource management\
    \ limits can be placed\n   on routing security processing events (see the comment\
    \ in Section 6,\n   paragraph 4, of [RFC5751]).\n"

  - "7.3.3.  Countering Selective Forwarding Attacks\n   Selective forwarding attacks\
    \ are a form of DoS attack that impacts\n   the availability of the generated\
    \ routing paths.\n   A selective forwarding attack may be done by a node involved\
    \ with the\n   routing process, or it may be done by what otherwise appears to\
    \ be a\n   passive antenna or other RF feature or device, but is in fact an\n\
    \   active (and selective) device.  An RF antenna/repeater that is not\n   selective\
    \ is not a threat.\n   An insider malicious node basically blends in neatly with\
    \ the network\n   but then may decide to forward and/or manipulate certain packets.\
    \  If\n   all packets are dropped, then this attacker is also often referred to\n\
    \   as a \"black hole\".  Such a form of attack is particularly dangerous\n  \
    \ if coupled with sinkhole attacks since inherently a large amount of\n   traffic\
    \ is attracted to the malicious node, thereby causing\n   significant damage.\
    \  In a shared medium, an outside malicious node\n   would selectively jam overheard\
    \ data flows, where the thus caused\n   collisions incur selective forwarding.\n\
    \   Selective forwarding attacks can be countered by deploying a series\n   of\
    \ mutually non-exclusive security measures:\n   o  Multipath routing of the same\
    \ message over disjoint paths.\n   o  Dynamically selecting the next hop from\
    \ a set of candidates.\n   The first measure basically guarantees that if a message\
    \ gets lost on\n   a particular routing path due to a malicious selective forwarding\n\
    \   attack, there will be another route that successfully delivers the\n   data.\
    \  Such a method is inherently suboptimal from an energy\n   consumption point\
    \ of view; it is also suboptimal from a network\n   utilization perspective. \
    \ The second method basically involves a\n   constantly changing routing topology\
    \ in that next-hop routers are\n   chosen from a dynamic set in the hope that\
    \ the number of malicious\n   nodes in this set is negligible.  A routing protocol\
    \ that allows for\n   disjoint routing paths may also be useful.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.3.4.  Countering Sinkhole Attacks\n   In sinkhole attacks, the malicious node\
    \ manages to attract a lot of\n   traffic mainly by advertising the availability\
    \ of high-quality links\n   even though there are none [Karlof2003].  Hence, it\
    \ constitutes a\n   serious attack on availability.\n   The malicious node creates\
    \ a sinkhole by attracting a large amount\n   of, if not all, traffic from surrounding\
    \ neighbors by advertising in\n   and outwards links of superior quality.  Hence,\
    \ affected nodes\n   eagerly route their traffic via the malicious node that,\
    \ if coupled\n   with other attacks such as selective forwarding, may lead to\
    \ serious\n   availability and security breaches.  Such an attack can only be\n\
    \   executed by an inside malicious node and is generally very difficult\n   to\
    \ detect.  An ongoing attack has a profound impact on the network\n   topology\
    \ and essentially becomes a problem of flow control.\n   Sinkhole attacks can\
    \ be countered by deploying a series of mutually\n   non-exclusive security measures\
    \ to:\n   o  use geographical insights for flow control;\n   o  isolate nodes\
    \ that receive traffic above a certain threshold;\n   o  dynamically pick up the\
    \ next hop from a set of candidates; and\n   o  allow only trusted data to be\
    \ received and forwarded.\n   A canary node could periodically call home (using\
    \ a cryptographic\n   process) with the home system, noting if it fails to call\
    \ in.  This\n   provides detection of a problem, but does not mitigate it, and\
    \ it may\n   have significant energy consequences for the LLN.\n   Some LLNs may\
    \ provide for geolocation services, often derived from\n   solving triangulation\
    \ equations from radio delay calculation; such\n   calculations could in theory\
    \ be subverted by a sinkhole that\n   transmitted at precisely the right power\
    \ in a node-to-node fashion.\n   While geographic knowledge could help assure\
    \ that traffic always goes\n   in the physical direction desired, it would not\
    \ assure that the\n   traffic is taking the most efficient route, as the lowest\

- title: 7.3.5.  Countering Wormhole Attacks
  contents:
  - "7.3.5.  Countering Wormhole Attacks\n   In wormhole attacks, at least two malicious\
    \ nodes claim to have a\n   short path between themselves [Karlof2003].  This\
    \ changes the\n   availability of certain routing paths and hence constitutes\
    \ a serious\n   security breach.\n   Essentially, two malicious insider nodes\

    \ thereby distort the\n   would-be-agreed routing path.  This distortion could\
    \ involve\n   shortcutting and hence paralyzing a large part of the network; it\n\
    \   could also involve tunneling the information to another region of the\n  \
    \ network where there are, e.g., more malicious nodes available to aid\n   the\
    \ intrusion or where messages are replayed, etc.\n   In conjunction with selective\

    \   wormhole can do in such a situation is to cease to operate (become\n   unstable),\
    \ causing the network to have to recalculate routes.\n   A highly unstable wormhole\
    \ is no different than a radio opaque (i.e.,\n   metal) door that opens and closes\

- title: 8.  RPL Security Features
  contents:
  - "8.  RPL Security Features\n   The assessments and analysis in Section 6 examined\
    \ all areas of\n   threats and attacks that could impact routing, and the\n  \
    \ countermeasures presented in Section 7 were reached without confining\n   the\
    \ consideration to means only available to routing.  This section\n   puts the\
    \ results into perspective, dealing with those threats that\n   are endemic to\
    \ this field, that have been mitigated through RPL\n   protocol design, and that\
    \ require specific decisions to be made as\n   part of provisioning a network.\n\
    \   The first part of this section, Sections 8.1 to 8.3, presents a\n   description\
    \ of RPL security features that address specific threats.\n   The second part\
    \ of this section, Section 8.4, discusses issues of the\n   provisioning of security\
    \ aspects that may impact routing but that\n   also require considerations beyond\
    \ the routing protocol, as well as\n   potential approaches.\n   RPL employs multicast,\
    \ so these alternative communications modes MUST\n   be secured with the same\
    \ routing security services specified in this\n   section.  Furthermore, irrespective\
    \ of the modes of communication,\n   nodes MUST provide adequate physical tamper\
    \ resistance commensurate\n   with the particular application-domain environment\
    \ to ensure the\n   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of stored routing\n\
    \   information.\n"
- title: 8.1.  Confidentiality Features
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Confidentiality Features\n   With regard to confidentiality, protecting\
    \ the routing/topology\n   information from unauthorized disclosure is not directly\
    \ essential to\n   maintaining the routing function.  Breaches of confidentiality\
    \ may\n   lead to other attacks or the focusing of an attacker's resources (see\n\
    \   Section 6.2) but does not of itself directly undermine the operation\n   of\
    \ the routing function.  However, to protect against and reduce\n   consequences\
    \ from other more direct attacks, routing information\n   should be protected.\
    \  Thus, to secure RPL:\n   o  Implement payload encryption using L3 mechanisms\
    \ described in\n      [RFC6550] or\n   o  Implement L2 confidentiality\n   Where\
    \ confidentiality is incorporated into the routing exchanges,\n   encryption algorithms\
    \ and key lengths need to be specified in\n   accordance with the level of protection\
    \ dictated by the routing\n   protocol and the associated application-domain transport\
    \ network.\n   For most networks, this means use of AES-128 in CCM mode, but this\n\
    \   needs to be specified clearly in the applicability statement.\n   In terms\
    \ of the lifetime of the keys, the opportunity to periodically\n   change the\
    \ encryption key increases the offered level of security for\n   any given implementation.\
    \  However, where strong cryptography is\n   employed, physical, procedural, and\
    \ logical data access protection\n   considerations may have a more significant\
    \ impact on cryptoperiod\n   selection than algorithm and key size factors.  Nevertheless,\
    \ in\n   general, shorter cryptoperiods, during which a single key is applied,\n\
    \   will enhance security.\n   Given the mandatory protocol requirement to implement\
    \ routing node\n   authentication as part of routing integrity (see Section 8.2),\
    \ key\n   exchanges may be coordinated as part of the integrity verification\n\
    \   process.  This provides an opportunity to increase the frequency of\n   key\
    \ exchange and shorten the cryptoperiod as a complement to the key\n   length\
    \ and encryption algorithm required for a given application\n   domain.\n"
- title: 8.2.  Integrity Features
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Integrity Features\n   The integrity of routing information provides the\
    \ basis for ensuring\n   that the function of the routing protocol is achieved\
    \ and maintained.\n   To protect integrity, RPL must run either using only the\
    \ secure\n   versions of the messages or over a L2 that uses channel binding\n\
    \   between node identity and transmissions.\n   Some L2 security mechanisms use\
    \ a single key for the entire network,\n   and these networks cannot provide a\
    \ significant amount of integrity\n   protection, as any node that has that key\
    \ may impersonate any other\n   node.  This mode of operation is likely acceptable\
    \ when an entire\n   deployment is under the control of a single administrative\
    \ entity.\n   Other L2 security mechanisms form a unique session key for every\
    \ pair\n   of nodes that needs to communicate; this is often called a per-link\n\
    \   key.  Such networks can provide a strong degree of origin\n   authentication\
    \ and integrity on unicast messages.\n   However, some RPL messages are broadcast,\
    \ and even when per-node L2\n   security mechanisms are used, the integrity and\
    \ origin authentication\n   of broadcast messages cannot be as trusted due to\
    \ the proliferation\n   of the key used to secure them.\n   RPL has two specific\
    \ options that are broadcast in RPL Control\n   Messages: the DIO and the DODAG\
    \ Information Solicitation (DIS).  The\n   purpose of the DIS is to cause potential\
    \ parents to reply with a DIO,\n   so the integrity of the DIS is not of great\
    \ concern.  The DIS may\n   also be unicast.\n   The DIO is a critical piece of\
    \ routing and carries many critical\n   parameters.  RPL provides for asymmetric\
    \ authentication at L3 of the\n   RPL Control Message carrying the DIO, and this\
    \ may be warranted in\n   some deployments.  A node could, if it felt that the\
    \ DIO that it had\n   received was suspicious, send a unicast DIS message to the\
    \ node in\n   question, and that node would reply with a unicast DIS.  Those\n\
    \   messages could be protected with the per-link key.\n"
- title: 8.3.  Availability Features
  contents:
  - "8.3.  Availability Features\n   Availability of routing information is linked\
    \ to system and network\n   availability, which in the case of LLNs require a\
    \ broader security\n   view beyond the requirements of the routing entities. \
    \ Where\n   availability of the network is compromised, routing information\n\
    \   availability will be accordingly affected.  However, to specifically\n   assist\
    \ in protecting routing availability, nodes MAY:\n   o  restrict neighborhood\
    \ cardinality;\n   o  use multiple paths;\n   o  use multiple destinations;\n\
    \   o  choose randomly if multiple paths are available;\n   o  set quotas to limit\

- title: 8.4.  Key Management
  contents:
  - "8.4.  Key Management\n   The functioning of the routing security services requires\
    \ keys and\n   credentials.  Therefore, even though it's not directly an RPL\n\
    \   security requirement, an LLN MUST have a process for initial key and\n   credential\
    \ configuration, as well as secure storage within the\n   associated devices.\
    \  Anti-tampering SHOULD be a consideration in\n   physical design.  Beyond initial\
    \ credential configuration, an LLN is\n   also encouraged to have automatic procedures\
    \ for the revocation and\n   replacement of the maintained security credentials.\n\
    \   While RPL has secure modes, some modes are impractical without the\n   use\
    \ of public key cryptography, which is believed to be too expensive\n   by many.\
    \  RPL L3 security will often depend upon existing LLN L2\n   security mechanisms,\
