- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Border Gateway Protocol [1] is an inter-autonomous system routing\n\
    \   protocol designed for TCP/IP networks.\n   This document describes an extension\
    \ to BGP which may be used to\n   create a confederation of autonomous systems\
    \ which is represented as\n   one single autonomous system to BGP peers external\
    \ to the\n   confederation.\n   The intention of this extension is to aid in policy\
    \ administration\n   and reduce the management complexity of maintaining a large\n\
    \   autonomous system.\n   The extension this document describes is widely deployed\
    \ in the\n   Internet today.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   It may be useful to subdivide autonomous systems with a very\
    \ large\n   number of BGP speakers into smaller domains for purposes of\n   controlling\
    \ routing policy via information contained in the BGP\n   AS_PATH attribute. \
    \ For example, one may chose to consider all BGP\n   speakers in a geographic\
    \ region as a single entity.\n   In addition to improvements in routing policy\
    \ control, current\n   techniques for deploying BGP among speakers in the same\
    \ autonomous\n   system establish a full mesh of TCP connections among all speakers\n\
    \   for the purpose of exchanging exterior routing information.  In\n   autonomous\
    \ systems the number of intra-domain connections that need\n   to be maintained\
    \ by each border router can become significant.\n   Subdividing a large autonomous\
    \ system allows a significant reduction\n   in the total number of intra-domain\
    \ BGP connections, as the\n   connectivity requirements simplify to the model\
    \ used for inter-domain\n   connections.\n   Unfortunately subdividing an autonomous\
    \ system may increase the\n   complexity of policy routing based on AS_PATH information\
    \ for all\n   members of the Internet.  Additionally, this division increases\
    \ the\n   maintenance overhead of coordinating external peering when the\n   internal\
    \ topology of this collection of autonomous systems is\n   modified.\n   Finally,\
    \ dividing a large AS may unnecessarily increase the length of\n   the sequence\
    \ portions of the AS_PATH attribute.  Several common BGP\n   implementations can\
    \ use the number of \"hops\" required to reach a\n   given destination as part\
    \ of the path selection criteria.  While this\n   is not an optimal method of\
    \ determining route preference, given the\n   lack of other in-band information,\
    \ it provides a reasonable default\n   behavior which is widely used across the\
    \ Internet.  Therefore,\n   division of an autonomous system into separate systems\
    \ may adversely\n   affect optimal routing of packets through the Internet.\n\
    \   However, there is usually no need to expose the internal topology of\n   this\
    \ divided autonomous system,  which means it is possible to regard\n   a collection\
    \ of autonomous systems under a common administration as a\n   single entity or\
    \ autonomous system when viewed from outside the\n   confines of the confederation\
    \ of autonomous systems itself.\n"

- title: Overview
  contents:
  - "Overview\n   IDRP[2] has the concept of a routing domain confederation.  An IDRP\n\
    \   routing domain confederation appears to IDRP speakers external to the\n  \
    \ confederation as a single administrative entity.  This extension is\n   based\
    \ upon that work.\n   In IDRP, routing domain confederations may be nested within\
    \ each\n   other or disjoint portions of still larger confederations.  The\n \
    \  algorithm BGP defines for additions to the AS_PATH attribute imposes\n   an\
    \ additional restriction that AS confederations must be strictly\n   hierarchical\
    \ in nature.\n"
- title: AS_CONFED segment type extension
  contents:
  - "AS_CONFED segment type extension\n   Currently, BGP specifies that the AS_PATH\
    \ attribute is a well-known\n   mandatory attribute that is composed of a sequence\
    \ of AS path\n   segments.  Each AS path segment is represented by a type/length/value\n\
    \   triple.\n   In [1], the path segment type is a 1-octet long field with the\
    \ two\n   following values defined:\n             Value     Segment Type\n   \
    \          1         AS_SET: unordered set of ASs a route in the\n           \
    \                   UPDATE message has traversed\n             2         AS_SEQUENCE:\
    \ ordered set of ASs a route in\n                              the UPDATE message\
    \ has traversed\n   This document reserves two additional segment types:\n   \
    \          3         AS_CONFED_SET: unordered set of ASs in the local\n      \
    \                        confederation that the UPDATE message\n             \
    \                 has traversed\n             4         AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE: ordered\
    \ set of ASs in the\n                              local confederation that the\
    \ UPDATE\n                              message has traversed\n"
- title: Operation
  contents:
  - "Operation\n   A member of a BGP confederation will use its confederation identifier\n\
    \   in all transactions with peers that are not members of its\n   confederation.\
    \  This confederation identifier is considered to be the\n   \"externally visible\"\
    \ AS number and this number is used in OPEN\n   messages and advertised in the\
    \ AS_PATH attribute.\n   A member of a BGP confederation will use its routing\
    \ domain\n   identifier (the internally visible AS number) in all transactions\n\
    \   with peers that are members of the same confederation as the given\n   router.\n\
    \   A BGP speaker receiving an AS_PATH attribute containing a\n   confederation\
    \ ID matching its own confederation shall treat the path\n   in the same fashion\
    \ as if it had received a path containing its own\n   AS number.\n"
- title: AS_PATH modification rules
  contents:
  - "AS_PATH modification rules\n   Section 5.1.2 of [1] is replaced with the following\
    \ text.\n   When a BGP speaker propagates a route which it has learned from\n\
    \   another BGP speaker's UPDATE message, it shall modify the route's\n   AS_PATH\
    \ attribute based on the location of the BGP speaker to which\n   the route will\
    \ be sent:\n      a) When a given BGP speaker advertises the route to another\
    \ BGP\n      speaker located in its own autonomous system, the advertising\n \
    \     speaker shall not modify the AS_PATH attribute associated with\n      the\
    \ route.\n      b) When a given BGP speaker advertises the route to a BGP\n  \
    \    speaker located in a neighboring autonomous system that is a\n      member\
    \ of the local autonomous system confederation, then the\n      advertising speaker\
    \ shall update the AS_PATH attribute as\n      follows:\n         1) if the first\
    \ path segment of the AS_PATH is of type\n         AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE, the local\
    \ system shall prepend its own AS\n         number as the last element of the\
    \ sequence (put it in the\n         leftmost position).\n         2) if the first\
    \ path segment of the AS_PATH is not of type\n         AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE the\
    \ local system shall prepend a new path\n         segment of type AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE\
    \ to the AS_PATH, including\n         its own confederation identifier in that\
    \ segment.\n      c) When a given BGP speaker advertises the route to a BGP\n\
    \      speaker located in a neighboring autonomous system that is not a\n    \
    \  member of the current routing domain confederation, then the\n      advertising\
    \ speaker shall update the AS_PATH attribute as\n      follows:\n         1) if\
    \ the first path segment of the AS_PATH is of type\n         AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE,\
    \ that segment and any immediately\n         following segments of the type AS_CONFED_SET\
    \ are removed from\n         the AS_PATH attribute, leaving the sanitized AS_PATH\n\
    \         attribute to be operated on by steps 2, or 3.\n         2) if the first\
    \ path segment of the remaining AS_PATH is of\n         type AS_SEQUENCE, the\
    \ local system shall prepend its own\n         confederation identifier as the\
    \ last element of the sequence\n         (put it in the leftmost position).\n\
    \         3) if there are no path segments following the removal of the\n    \
    \     first AS_CONFED_SET/AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE segments, or if the\n         first\
    \ path segment of the remaining AS_PATH is of type AS_SET\n         the local\
    \ system shall prepend a new path segment of type\n         AS_SEQUENCE to the\
    \ AS_PATH, including its own confederation\n         identifier in that segment.\n\
    \   When a BGP speaker originates a route:\n      a) the originating speaker shall\
    \ include an empty AS_PATH\n      attribute in all UPDATE messages sent to BGP\
    \ speakers located in\n      its own autonomous system. (An empty AS_PATH attribute\
    \ is one\n      whose length field contains the value zero).\n      b) the originating\
    \ speaker shall include its own AS number in an\n      AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE segment\
    \ of the AS_PATH attribute of all\n      UPDATE messages sent to BGP speakers\
    \ located in neighboring\n      autonomous systems that are members of the local\
    \ confederation.\n      (In this case, the AS number of the originating speaker's\
    \ member\n      autonomous system number will be the only entry in the AS_PATH\n\
    \      attribute).\n      c) the originating speaker shall include its own confederation\n\
    \      identifier in a AS_SEQUENCE segment of the AS_PATH attribute of\n     \
    \ all UPDATE messages sent to BGP speakers located in neighboring\n      autonomous\
    \ systems that are not members of the local\n      confederation. (In this case,\
    \ the confederation identifier of\n      the originating speaker's member confederation\
    \ will be the only\n      entry in the AS_PATH attribute).\n"
- title: Common Administration Issues
  contents:
  - "Common Administration Issues\n   It is reasonable for member ASs of a confederation\
    \ to share a common\n   administration and IGP information for the entire confederation.\n\
    \   It shall be legal for a BGP speaker to advertise an unchanged\n   NEXT_HOP\
    \ and MULTI_EXIT_DISCRIMINATOR attribute to peers in a\n   neighboring AS within\
    \ the same confederation.  In addition, the\n   restriction against sending the\
    \ LOCAL_PREFERENCE attribute to peers\n   in a neighboring AS within the same\
    \ confederation is removed.  Path\n   selection criteria for information received\
    \ from members inside a\n   confederation may follow the same rules used for information\
    \ received\n   from members inside the same autonomous system.\n"
- title: Compatibility
  contents:
  - "Compatibility\n   All BGP speakers participating in a confederation must recognize\
    \ the\n   AS_CONFED_SET and AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE segment type extensions to the\n\
    \   AS_PATH attribute.\n   Any BGP speaker not supporting these extensions will\
    \ generate a\n   notification message specifying an \"UPDATE Message Error\" and\
    \ a sub-\n   code of \"Malformed AS_PATH\".\n   This compatibility issue implies\
    \ that all BGP speakers participating\n   in a confederation must support BGP\
    \ confederations,  however BGP\n   speakers outside the confederation need not\
    \ support these extensions.\n"
- title: Compatibility Discussion
  contents:
  - "Compatibility Discussion\n   We considered the use of a distinct, optional, transitive\
    \ attribute\n   to carry AS confederation information as opposed to specifying\
    \ new\n   types in the existing AS path attribute.  This would relax the\n   requirement\
    \ that all BGP speakers participating in a confederation to\n   allow the use\
    \ of legacy units provided they have no external (i.e.\n   neither inter-AS nor\
    \ intra-confederation) connectivity.\n   At the time of this writing, an implementation\
    \ of this extension as\n   documented is widely deployed throughout the Internet,\
    \  therefore the\n   value of any change that is incompatible with this document\
    \ must be\n   weighed against the benefit gained from a relaxation of this\n \
    \  restriction.\n"
