  - "1.  Introduction\n   DHCPv6 [1] provides IP addresses and configuration information
    for\n   IPv6 clients.  It includes a relay agent capability, in which\n   processes
    within the network infrastructure receive multicast\n   messages from clients
    and relay them to DHCPv6 servers.  In some\n   network environments, it will be
    useful for the relay agent to add\n   information to the DHCPv6 message before
    relaying it.\n   The information that relay agents supply can also be used in
    the\n   server's decision making about the addresses, delegated prefixes [4],\n
    \  and configuration parameters that the client is to receive.\n   The memo specifies
    the DHCPv6 equivalent of the DHCPv4 Relay Agent\n   option's Remote-ID suboption
    as specified in [2].  The motivation and\n   usage scenarios are provided in [2].\n"

  - "3.  The Relay Agent Remote-ID Option\n   This option may be added by DHCPv6 relay
    agents that terminate\n   switched or permanent circuits and have mechanisms to
    identify the\n   remote host end of the circuit.\n   The format of the DHCPv6
    Relay Agent Remote-ID option is shown below:\n        0                   1                   2

    of the remote-id\n                          field.  The minimum option-len is
    5 octets.\n       enterprise-number  The vendor's registered Enterprise Number
    as\n                          registered with IANA [5].\n       remote-id          The
    opaque value for the remote-id.\n   The definition of the remote-id carried in
    this option is vendor\n   specific.  The vendor is indicated in the enterprise-number
    field.\n   The remote-id field may be used to encode, for instance:\n   o  a \"caller
    ID\" telephone number for dial-up connection\n   o  a \"user name\" prompted for
    by a Remote Access Server\n   o  a remote caller ATM address\n   o  a \"modem
    ID\" of a cable data modem\n   o  the remote IP address of a point-to-point link\n
    \  o  a remote X.25 address for X.25 connections\n   o  an interface or port identifier\n
    \  Each vendor must ensure that the remote-id is unique for its\n   enterprise-number,
    as the octet sequence of enterprise-number\n   followed by remote-id must be globally
    unique.  One way to achieve\n   uniqueness might be to include the relay agent's
    DHCP Unique\n   Identifier (DUID) [1] in the remote-id.\n"

  - "4.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior\n   DHCPv6 relay agents may be configured to
    include a Remote-ID option\n   in relayed (RELAY-FORW) DHCPv6 messages.\n"
  title: 4.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior
- contents:
  - "5.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior\n   This option provides additional information to
    the DHCPv6 server.\n   The DHCPv6 server, if it is configured to support this
    option, may\n   use this information to select parameters specific to particular\n
    \  users, hosts, or subscriber modems.  The combined enterprise-number\n   and
    remote-id SHOULD be considered an opaque value, with policies\n   based on exact
    string match only; that is, the remote-id field SHOULD\n   NOT be internally parsed
    by the server.\n   There is no requirement that a server return this option and
    its data\n   in a RELAY-REPLY message.\n"
  title: 5.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   See [1] section 21.1, on securing DHCPv6 messages
    sent between\n   servers and relay agents, and section 23, on general DHCPv6 security\n
    \  considerations.  [2] discusses how this information can be used to\n   enhance
    trust in some environments.\n   Note that even if the DHCP server trusts the relay
    agent not to\n   modify information provided in this option, the confidence in
    that\n   information is no higher than the confidence that the relay agent has\n
    \  in the information it puts in the option.  For example, in some\n   protocols
    it may be possible for a DHCP client to spoof or otherwise\n   choose port identifiers,
    caller ID information, or other information\n   carried in this option.  Sites
    should consider such possible spoofing\n   and how likely it is in their environment
    when deciding what uses of\n   this option are appropriate.\n"
