  - "                    Standardizing Network Mail Headers\n     One of the deficiences\
    \ of the current FTP mail protocol is that\n     it makes no provision for the\
    \ explicit specification of such\n     header information as author, title, and\
    \ date.  Many systems\n     send that information, but each in a different format.\
    \  One\n     fairly serious result of this lack of standardization is that\n \
    \    it's next to impossible for a system or user program to\n     intelligently\
    \ process incoming mail.                              \n     Although the long-term\
    \ solution to the problem is probably to\n     add commands for specifying such\
    \ information to the mail\n     protocol command space (as suggested in RFC 524\
    \ -- 17140,), we\n     hereby propose a more quickly implemented solution for\
    \ the\n     interim.                                                         \
    \ \n     We suggest that the text of network mail, whether transmitted\n     over\
    \ the FTP telnet connection (via the MAIL command) or over a\n     separate data\
    \ connection (with the MLFL command), be governed by\n     the syntax below: \
    \                                                \n        Example:          \
    \                                            \n           From: White at SRI-ARC\n\
    \           Date: 24 JUL 1973 1527-PDT\n           Subject: Multi-Site Journal\
