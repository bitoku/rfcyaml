- title: 1.  Introduction and Background
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and Background\n   The IETF began standardizing two different\
    \ DNS protocol enhancements\n   for IPv6 addresses in DNS records: AAAA was specified\
    \ in 1995 as a\n   Proposed Standard [RFC1886] and later in 2003 as a Draft Standard\n\
    \   [RFC3596], and A6 appeared in 2000 as a Proposed Standard [RFC2874].\n   The\
    \ existence of multiple ways to represent an IPv6 address in the\n   DNS has led\
    \ to confusion and conflicts about which of these protocol\n   enhancements should\
    \ be implemented and/or deployed.  Having more than\n   one choice of how IPv6\
    \ addresses are to be represented within the DNS\n   can be argued to have led\
    \ to delays in the deployment of IPv6.  In\n   2002, \"Representing Internet Protocol\
    \ version 6 (IPv6) Addresses in\n   the Domain Name System (DNS)\" [RFC3363] moved\
    \ A6 to Experimental\n   status, with an aim of clearing up any confusion in this\
    \ area.\n   [RFC3363] and [RFC3364] compared AAAA and A6, and examined many of\n\
    \   the issues in the A6 standard; these issues are summarized in this\n   document.\n\
    \   After ten years, the Experimental status of A6 continues to result in\n  \
    \ confusion and parallel deployment of both A6 and AAAA, albeit AAAA\n   predominates\
    \ by a large degree.  In recent IPv6 transition tests and\n   deployments, some\
    \ providers informally mentioned A6 support as a\n   possible future choice.\n\
    \   This document provides a brief summary of the issues related to the\n   use\
    \ of A6 records and discusses the current usage status of A6.\n   Given the implications\
    \ of A6 on the DNS architecture and the state of\n   A6 deployment, this document\
    \ moves RFC 2874 [RFC2874] to Historic\n   status, thereby clarifying that implementers\
    \ and operators should\n   represent IPv6 addresses in the DNS by using AAAA records\
    \ only.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Standards Action Taken
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Standards Action Taken\n   Per this document, the status of RFC 2874 has\
    \ been changed from\n   Experimental to Historic.\n"
- title: 2.  A6 Issues
  contents:
  - "2.  A6 Issues\n   This section summarizes the known issues associated with the\
    \ use of\n   A6 resource records (RRs), including the analyses explored in\n \
    \  [RFC3363].  The reader is encouraged to review that document to fully\n   understand\
    \ the issues relating to A6.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Resolution Latency
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Resolution Latency\n   Resolving an A6 record chain can involve resolving\
    \ a series of\n   subqueries that are likely to be independent of each other.\
    \  Each of\n   these subqueries takes a non-negligible amount of time unless the\n\
    \   answer already happens to be in the resolver's cache.  In the worst-\n   case\
    \ scenario, the time spent resolving an N-link chain A6 record\n   would be the\
    \ sum of the latency resulting from each of the N\n   resolutions.  As a result,\
    \ long A6 chains would likely increase user\n   frustration due to an excessive\
    \ wait time for domain names to\n   resolve.\n   In practice, it is very hard\
    \ to derive a reasonable timeout-handling\n   strategy for the reassembly of all\
    \ the results from A6 subqueries.\n   It has proved difficult to decide multiple\
    \ timeout parameters,\n   including: (1) the communication timeout for a single\
    \ A6 fragment,\n   (2) the communication timeout for the IPv6 address itself (total\
    \ time\n   needed for reassembly), and (3) the Time to Live (TTL) timeout for\
    \ A6\n   fragment records.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Resolution Failure
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Resolution Failure\n   The probability of A6 resolution failure during\
    \ the process of\n   resolving an N-link A6 chain is the sum of the probabilities\
    \ of\n   failure of each subquery, since each of the queries involved in\n   resolving\
    \ an A6 chain has a nonzero probability of failure, and an A6\n   resolution cannot\
    \ complete until all subqueries have succeeded.\n   Furthermore, the failure may\
    \ happen at any link among 1~N of an N-\n   Link A6 chain.  Therefore, it would\
    \ take an indeterminate time to\n   return a failure result.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Cross Administrative Domains
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Cross Administrative Domains\n   One of the primary motivations for the\
    \ A6 RR is to facilitate\n   renumbering and multihoming, where the prefix name\
    \ field in the A6 RR\n   points to a target that is not only outside the DNS zone\
    \ containing\n   the A6 RR, but is administered by a different organization entirely.\n\
    \   While pointers out-of-zone are not a problem per se, experience both\n   with\
    \ glue RRs and with PTR RRs in the IN-ADDR.ARPA tree suggests that\n   pointers\
    \ to other organizations are often not maintained properly,\n   perhaps because\
    \ they're less amenable to automation than pointers\n   within a single organization\
    \ would be.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Difficult Maintenance
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Difficult Maintenance\n   In A6, changes to components of an RR are not\
    \ isolated from the use\n   of the composite IPv6 address.  Any change to a non-128-bit\
    \ component\n   of an A6 RR may cause change to a large number of IPv6 addresses.\n\
    \   The relationship dependency actually makes the maintenance of\n   addresses\
    \ much more complicated and difficult.  Without understanding\n   these complicated\
    \ relationships, any arbitrary change for a\n   non-128-bit A6 RR component may\
    \ result in undesired consequences.\n   Multiple correlative subcomponents of\
    \ A6 records may have different\n   TTLs, which can make cache maintenance very\
    \ complicated.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Existence of Multiple RR Types for One Purpose Is Harmful
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Existence of Multiple RR Types for One Purpose Is Harmful\n   If both AAAA\
    \ and A6 records were widely deployed in the global DNS,\n   it would impose more\
    \ query delays to the client resolvers.  DNS\n   clients have insufficient knowledge\
    \ to choose between AAAA and A6\n   queries, requiring local policy to determine\
    \ which record type to\n   query.  If local policy dictates parallel queries for\
    \ both AAAA and\n   A6 records, and if those queries returned different results\
    \ for any\n   reason, the clients would have no knowledge about which address\
    \ to\n   choose.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Higher Security Risks
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Higher Security Risks\n   The dependency relationships inherent in A6 chains\
    \ increase security\n   risks.  An attacker may successfully attack a single subcomponent\
    \ of\n   an A6 record, which would then influence many query results, and\n  \
    \ possibly every host on a large site.  There is also the danger of\n   unintentionally\
    \ or maliciously creating a resolution loop -- an A6\n   chain may create an infinite\
    \ loop because an out of zone pointer may\n   point back to another component\
    \ farther down the A6 chain.\n"
- title: 3.  Current Usage of A6
  contents:
  - "3.  Current Usage of A6\n   Full support for IPv6 in the global DNS can be argued\
    \ to have started\n   when the first IPv6 records were associated with root servers\
    \ in\n   early 2008.\n   One of the major DNS server software packages, BIND9\
    \ [BIND], supports\n   both A6 and AAAA, and is unique among the major DNS resolvers\
    \ in that\n   certain versions of the BIND9 resolver will attempt to query for\
    \ A6\n   records and follow A6 chains.\n   According to published statistics for\
    \ two root DNS servers (the \"K\"\n   root server [KROOT] and the \"L\" root server\
    \ [LROOT]), there are\n   between 9,000 and 14,000 DNS queries per second on the\
    \ \"K\" root\n   server and between 13,000 to 19,000 queries per second on the\
    \ \"L\"\n   root server.  The distributions of those queries by RR type are\n\
    \   similar: roughly 60% A queries, 20~25% AAAA queries, and less than 1%\n  \
    \ A6 queries.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Reasons for Current A6 Usage
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Reasons for Current A6 Usage\n   That there is A6 query traffic does not\
    \ mean that A6 is actually in\n   use; it is likely the result of some recursive\
    \ servers that issue\n   internally generated A6 queries when looking up missing\
    \ name server\n   addresses, in addition to issuing A and AAAA queries.\n   BIND\
    \ versions 9.0 through 9.2 could be configured to make A6 queries,\n   and it\
    \ is possible that some active name servers running those\n   versions have not\
    \ yet been upgraded.\n   In the late 1990s, A6 was considered to be the future\
    \ in preference\n   to AAAA [RFC2874].  As a result, A6 queries were tried by\
    \ default in\n   BINDv9 versions.  When it was pointed out that A6 had some\n\
    \   fundamental issues (discussed in [A6DISC] with the deprecation\n   codified\
    \ in RFC 3363), A6 was abandoned in favor of AAAA and BINDv9\n   no longer tried\
    \ A6 records by default.  A6 was removed from the query\n   order in the BIND\
    \ distribution in 2004 or 2005.\n   Some Linux/glibc versions may have had A6\
    \ query implementations in\n   gethostbyname() 8-10 years ago.  These operating\
    \ systems/libraries\n   may not have been replaced or upgraded everywhere yet.\n"
- title: 4.  Moving A6 to Historic Status
  contents:
  - "4.  Moving A6 to Historic Status\n   This document moves the A6 specification\
    \ to Historic status.  This\n   move provides a clear signal to implementers and/or\
    \ operators that A6\n   should NOT be implemented or deployed.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Impact on Current A6 Usage
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Impact on Current A6 Usage\n   If A6 were in use and it were to be treated\
    \ as an 'unknown record'\n   (RFC3597) as discussed below, it might lead to some\
    \ interoperability\n   issues since resolvers that support A6 are required to\
    \ do additional\n   section processing for these records on the wire.  However,\
    \ as there\n   are no known production uses of A6, the impact is considered\n\
    \   negligible.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Transition Phase for Current A6 Usage
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Transition Phase for Current A6 Usage\n   Since there is no known A6-only\
    \ client in production use, the\n   transition phase may not be strictly necessary.\
    \  However, clients\n   that attempt to resolve A6 before AAAA will suffer a performance\n\
    \   penalty.  Therefore, we recommend that:\n      *  A6 handling from all new\
    \ or updated host stacks be removed;\n      *  All existing A6 records be removed;\
    \ and,\n      *  All resolver and server implementations to return the same\n\
    \         response as for any unknown or deprecated RR type for all A6\n     \
    \    queries.  If a AAAA record exists for the name being resolved,\n        \
    \ a suitable response would be 'no answers/no error', i.e., the\n         response\
    \ packet has an answer count of 0 but no error is\n         indicated.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Removing A6 records will eliminate any security\
    \ exposure related to\n   that RR type, and should introduce no new vulnerabilities.\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has updated the annotation of the A6 RR type\
    \ (code 38) from\n   \"Experimental\" to \"Obsolete\" in the DNS Parameters registry.\n"
