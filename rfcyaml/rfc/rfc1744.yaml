  - "1.  Introduction\n   The area explicitly examined here is the allocatable globally\
    \ unique\n   IPv4 address space.  Explicitly this includes those address groups\n\
    \   uniquely assigned from a single comprehensive address pool to\n   specific\
    \ entities which are then at liberty to assign individual\n   address values within\
    \ the address group to individual hosts.  The\n   address group is handled by\
    \ the technology as a single network\n   entity.\n   At present these addresses\
    \ are allocated to entities on a freely\n   available, first-come, first-served\
    \ allocation basis, within the\n   scope of a number of administrative grounds\
    \ which attempt to direct\n   the allocation process to result in rational use\
    \ of the space, and\n   attempt to achieve a result of a level of equity of availability\
    \ that\n   is expressed in a sense of multi-national \"regions\" [1].\n   In examining\
    \ the current management policies in further detail it is\n   useful to note that\
    \ the IPv4 address space presents a number of\n   attributes in common with other\
    \ public space resources, and there are\n   parallels in an economic analysis\
    \ of this resource which include:\n    - the finite nature of the resource\n \
    \     This attribute is a consequence of the underlying technology\n      which\
    \ has defined addressed entities in terms of a 32 bit address\n      value.  The\
    \ total pool is composed of 2**32 distinct values (not\n      all of which are\
    \ assignable to end systems).\n    - the address space has considerable market\
    \ value\n      This valuation is a consequence of the availability and extensive\n\
    \      deployment of the underlying Internet technology that allows\n      uniquely\
    \ addressed entities the capability to conduct direct end-\n      to-end transactions\
    \ with peer entities via the Internet.  The\n      parameters of this valuation\
    \ are also influenced by considerations\n      of efficiency of use of the allocated\
    \ space, availability of end\n      system based internet technologies, the availability\
    \ of Internet-\n      based service providers and the resultant Internet market\
    \ size.\n    - address space management is a necessary activity\n      Management\
    \ processes are requires to ensure unique allocation and\n      fair access to\
    \ the resource, as well as the activity of continuing\n      maintenance of allocation\
    \ record databases.\n   Increasing rates of Internet address allocation in recent\
    \ years imply\n   that the IPv4 address space is now a visibly finite resource,\
    \ and\n   current projections, assuming a continuation of existing demand for\n\
    \   addresses predict unallocated address space exhaustion in the next 6\n   -\
    \ 12 years (rephrasing current interim projections from the IETF\n   Address Lifetime\
    \ Expectancy Working Group).  There are two derivative\n   questions that arise\
    \ from this prediction.  Firstly what is the\n   likely outcome of unallocated\
    \ address space exhaustion if it does\n   occur, and secondly, are there corrective\
    \ processes that may be\n   applied to the current address management mechanisms\
    \ that could allow\n   both more equitable allocation and potentially extend the\
    \ lifetime of\n   the unallocated address space pool.  These two issues are considered\n\
    \   in the following sections.\n"

  - "2. Outcomes of Unallocated Address Space Exhaustion - No change in\n   current\
    \ Address Management Policies\n   As the pool of available addresses for allocation\
    \ depletes, the\n   initial anticipated outcome will be the inability of the available\n\
    \   address pool to service large block address allocation requests.\n   Such\
    \ requests have already been phrased from various utility\n   operators, and the\
    \ demand for very large address blocks is likely to\n   be a continuing feature\
    \ of address pool management.  It is noted that\n   the overall majority of the\
    \ allocated address space is very\n   inefficiently utilised at present (figures\
    \ of efficiency of use of\n   less than 1% are noted in RFC 1466, and higher efficiency\
    \ utilisation\n   is readily achievable using more recent routing technologies,\
    \ such as\n   Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSM) and disjoint subnet routing).\n\
    \   Given the continuing depletion of the unallocated address pool, and\n   the\
    \ consequent inability to service all address allocation requests,\n   it is a\
    \ likely outcome of interaction between those entities with\n   allocated address\
    \ space and those seeking address allocation that\n   such allocation requests\
    \ could be satisfied through a private\n   transaction. In this situation an entity\
    \ already in possession of a\n   sufficiently large but inefficiently utilised\
    \ allocated address block\n   could resell the block to a third party, and then\
    \ seek allocation of\n   a smaller address block from the remaining unallocated\
    \ address space.\n   The implication is that both address blocks would be more\
    \ efficiently\n   utilised, although it is the entity which has large blocks of\n\
    \   allocated address space which would be the primary beneficiary of\n   such\
    \ transactions, effectively capitalising on the opportunity cost\n   of higher\
    \ efficiency of address block use.\n   Such reselling / trading opportunities\
    \ which involve the use of the\n   unallocated address pool would in all likelihood\
    \ be a short term\n   scenario, as the high returns from this type of trading\
    \ would\n   increase the allocation pressure from the pool and act to increase\n\
    \   depletion rates as more pressure is placed to claim large address\n   blocks\
    \ for later resale once such blocks are no longer available from\n   the unallocated\
    \ pool.\n   Following exhaustion of the unallocated address pool a free trading\n\
    \   environment in address blocks is a probable outcome, where address\n   blocks\
    \ would be bought and sold between trading entities.  The\n   consequent market,\
    \ if unregulated, would act to price address space\n   at a level commensurate\
    \ with the common expectation of the market\n   value of addresses, trading at\
    \ a price level reflecting both the\n   level of demand, the opportunity cost\
    \ of more efficient address use,\n   and the opportunity cost of deployment of\
    \ additional or alternate\n   internetworking technologies to IPv4.  It is interesting\
    \ to note that\n   within such an environment the registry (or whatever takes\
    \ the place\n   of a registry in such an environment) becomes analogous to a title\n\
    \   office, acting to record the various transactions to ensure the\n   continued\
    \ accuracy of \"ownership\" and hence acts as a source of\n   information to the\
    \ purchaser to check on the validity of the sale by\n   checking on the validity\
    \ of the \"title\" of the vendor.  This impacts\n   on the characteristic features\
    \ of Internet address registries, which\n   effectively become analogous to \"\
    titles offices\", which typically are\n   structured as service entities with\
    \ \"lodgement fees\" used to fund the\n   action of recording title changes. \
    \ Whether existing registries adapt\n   to undertake this new function, or whether\
    \ other entities provide\n   this function is a moot point - either way the function\
    \ is a\n   necessary adjunct to such a trading environment.\n   It is also anticipated\
    \ that in an unregulated environment the trade\n   in address blocks would very\
    \ quickly concentrate to a position of\n   address trading between major Internet\
    \ providers, where a small\n   number of entities would control the majority of\
    \ the traded volume\n   (market efficiency considerations would imply that traders\
    \ with large\n   inventories would be more efficient within this trading domain).\
    \  It\n   is also reasonable to expect that the Internet service providers\n \
    \  would dominate this trading area, as they have the greatest level of\n   vested\
    \ interest in this market resource.  This would allow the\n   Internet service\
    \ provider to operate with a considerably greater\n   degree of confidence in\
    \ service lifetime expectation, as the service\n   provider would be in the position\
    \ of price setting of the basic\n   address resource and be able to generate an\
    \ address pool as a hedge\n   against local address depletion for the provider's\
    \ client base.\n   There is of course the consequent risk of the natural tendency\
    \ of\n   these entities forming a trading cartel, establishing a trading\n   monopoly\
    \ position in this space, setting up a formidable barrier\n   against the entry\
    \ of new service providers in this area of the\n   market.  Such a scenario readily\
    \ admits the position of monopoly-\n   based service price setting. Compounding\
    \ this is the risk that the\n   providers set up their own \"title office\", so\
    \ that in effect the\n   major trading block actually controls the only means\
    \ of establishing\n   legitimacy of \"ownership\", which in terms of risk of anti-competitive\n\
    \   trading practices is a very seriously damaged outcome.\n   Assuming a relatively\
    \ low cost of achieving significantly higher\n   efficiency address utilisation\
    \ than at present, then the resultant\n   market is bounded only by the costs\
    \ of agility of renumbering.  Here\n   renumbering would be anticipated to occur\
    \ in response to acquisition\n   of a different address block in response to changing\
    \ local address\n   requirements, and the frequency of renumbering may occur in\
    \ cycles of\n   duration between weeks and years.  Markets would also be constrained\n\
    \   by deployment costs, where local address trading within a provider\n   domain\
    \ would have little cost impact on deployment services (as the\n   aggregated\
    \ routing scenario would be unchanged for the provider and\n   the provider's\
    \ peers) whereas trading in small sized blocks across\n   provider domains would\
    \ result in increased operational service cost\n   due to increased routing costs\
    \ (where efforts to create aggregated\n   routing entries are frustrated by the\
    \ effects of address leakage into\n   other routing domains).\n   In examining\
    \ this consequent environment the major technical outcome\n   is strong pressure\
    \ for dynamic host address assignment services,\n   where the connection and disconnection\
    \ of hosts into the Internet\n   environment will cause a local state change in\
    \ allocated addresses\n   (which may in turn trigger consequent extended dynamic\
    \ renumbering\n   from time to time to accommodate longer term address usage trends).\n\
    \   It is also reasonable to predict a strengthening market for dynamic\n   address\
    \ translation technologies, as an alternate client strategy to\n   the purchase\
    \ of large address blocks from the trading market (this\n   scenario is the use\
    \ of a private, potentially non-unique address\n   space within the client network,\
    \ and the dynamic translation of end\n   host addresses into a smaller unique\
    \ Internet routed address pool to\n   support external end-to-end sessions), and\
    \ also the strengthened\n   market for firewall boundary technologies which also\
    \ admit the use of\n   private address space within the client domain.\n   While\
    \ it is not possible to accurately predict specific outcomes, it\n   would appear\
    \ to be the case that increasing overall efficiency of\n   address utilisation\
    \ will be most visible only after unallocated\n   address pool exhaustion has\
    \ occurred, as there is then a consequent\n   strong economic motivation for such\
    \ activity across all the entire\n   Internet address space.\n   As perhaps a\
    \ cautionary comment regarding evolutionary technologies\n   for IPv4, it would\
    \ also appear to be the case that evolutionary\n   technologies will not assume\
    \ a quantum increase in economic viability\n   simply because of unallocated address\
    \ pool exhaustion.  Such\n   technologies will only lever additional advantage\
    \ over IPv4 once the\n   marginal cost of increased IPv4 address space deployment\
    \ efficiency\n   exceeds the marginal cost of deployment of new technologies,\
    \ a\n   situation which may not occur for some considerable time after\n   unallocated\
    \ address pool exhaustion.\n"
- title: 3. Modification of Current Internet Address Management Policies
  contents:
  - "3. Modification of Current Internet Address Management Policies\n   The three\
    \ major attributes of the current address allocation\n   procedures from the unallocated\
    \ pool are \"first come first served\"\n   (FCFS) and allocation on a \"once and\
    \ for all\" (OAFA) basis, and the\n   absence of any charge for address allocation\
    \ (FREE).\n   As noted above, the outcomes of such a process, when constrained\
    \ by\n   the finite quantity of the resource in question, ultimately leads to\n\
    \   a secondary market in the resource, where initially allocated\n   resources\
    \ are subsequently traded at their market valuation.  This\n   secondary trade\
    \ benefits only those entities who established a\n   primary position from the\
    \ unallocated pool, and it is noted with\n   concern that the optimal behaviour\
    \ while the unallocated pool exists\n   is to hoard allocated addresses on the\
    \ basis that the secondary\n   market will come into existence once the pool is\
    \ exhausted.  Such a\n   market does not benefit the original address management\
    \ operation,\n   nor does it necessarily benefit the wider community of current\
    \ and\n   potential interested parties in the Internet community.\n   It is also\
    \ noted that the outcome of a free address allocation policy\n   is the vesting\
    \ of the management of the address space to the larger\n   Internet Service Providers,\
    \ on the basis that in the absence of end\n   client address allocation charging\
    \ policies which have the capability\n   of ensuring an independent address management\
    \ function, those\n   entities who have the greatest vested interest in the quality\
    \ of the\n   address allocation and registration function will inevitably fund\n\
    \   such an operation in the absence of any other mechanism.  The risk\n   within\
    \ this scenario is that placing the major asset of any\n   communications medium\
    \ into the sphere of interest of the current\n   entities trading within that\
    \ medium acts to increase the risk of\n   anti-competitive monopolistic trading\
    \ practices.\n   An alternate address management strategy is one of allocation\
    \ and\n   recovery, where the allocation of an address is restricted to a\n  \
    \ defined period, so that the allocation can be regarded as a lease of\n   the\
    \ resource.  In such an environment pricing of the resource is a\n   potential\
    \ tool to achieve an efficient and dynamic address allocation\n   mechanism (although\
    \ it is immediately asserted that pricing alone may\n   be insufficient to ensure\
    \ a fair, equitable and rational outcome of\n   address accessibility and subsequent\
    \ exploitation, and consequently\n   pricing and associated allocation policies\
    \ would be a normative\n   approach to such a public resource management issue).\n\
    \   It is noted that pricing as a component of a public resource\n   management\
    \ framework is a very common practice, where price and\n   policy are used together\
    \ to ensure equitable access, efficient\n   utilisation and availability for reallocation\
    \ after use.  Pricing\n   practices which include features of higher cost for\
    \ larger address\n   blocks assist with equitable access to a diversity of entities\
    \ who\n   desire address allocation (in effect a scarcity premium), and pricing\n\
    \   practices can be devised to encourage provider-based dynamic address\n   allocation\
    \ and reallocation environments.\n   In the same fashion as a conventional lease,\
    \ the leasee would have\n   the first option for renewal of the lease at the termination\
    \ of the\n   lease period, allowing the lease to be developed and maintain a\n\
    \   market value.  Such pricing policies would effectively imply a\n   differential\
    \ cost for deployment of a uniquely addressed host with\n   potential full Internet\
    \ peering and reachability (including local\n   reachability) and deployment of\
    \ a host with a locally defined (and\n   potentially non-unique) address and consequent\
    \ restriction to local\n   reachability.\n   It is also observed that pricing\
    \ policies can encourage efficient\n   address space utilisation through factors\
    \ of opportunity cost of\n   unused space, balanced by the potential cost of host\
    \ renumbering\n   practices or the cost of deployment of dynamic address allocation\
    \ or\n   translation technologies.\n   There are a number of anticipated outcomes\
    \ of a management mechanism\n   which including pricing elements for the IPv4\
    \ address space\n   Firstly current address space utilisation projections (anticipated\n\
    \   useful lifetime for the pool of unallocated addresses) would extend\n   further\
    \ into the future due to the factors of cost pressure for more\n   efficient address\
    \ utilisation, and the additional cost of issuing a\n   local resource with a\
    \ globally unique address and the opportunity\n   cost of extravagant use of global\
    \ addresses with purely local\n   domains.\n   Secondly dynamic host address binding\
    \ technologies, and dynamic\n   network address translation technologies would\
    \ be anticipated to be\n   widely deployed, based on the perceived cost opportunities\
    \ of using\n   such technologies as an alternative to extensive static host address\n\
    \   binding using globally unique addresses.  Use of such technologies\n   would\
    \ imply further extension of the lifetime of the address pool.\n   Such pricing\
    \ practices could be applied on a basis of all future\n   address allocations,\
    \ leaving those entities with already allocated\n   address blocks outside of\
    \ the lease mechanism.  Alternatively such\n   previous allocations could be converted\
    \ to leases, applying a single\n   management policy across the entire address\
    \ space and accordingly\n   levering the maximal benefit from such pricing policies\
    \ in terms of\n   maximising the lifetime of the address space and maximising\
    \ the value\n   of the address space.  In such a situation of conversion some\
    \ level\n   of recognition of previous implicit OAFA allocation policies can be\n\
    \   offset through delay of conversion to lease and also through\n   conversion\
    \ of such previously allocated addresses to the lease,\n   waiving the lease purchase\
    \ costs in such cases.\n"
- title: 4. Internet Environment Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Internet Environment Considerations\n   Pricing for IPv4 addresses as a component\
    \ of the overall address\n   management framework is by no means a novel concept,\
    \ and despite the\n   advantages such pricing policies may offer in terms of outcomes\
    \ of\n   efficiency of utilisation, fair and equitable access, security of\n \
    \  allocation and consequent market value, and despite the address pool\n   exhaustion\
    \ time offsets such policies offer, it is the undeniable\n   case that no explicit\
    \ pricing policies have been successfully\n   introduced into the Internet address\
    \ allocation processes to date.\n   There are two predominate reasons offered\
    \ in this analysis.  The\n   first is the somewhat uncertain nature of the exact\
    \ origin of primary\n   ownership of the IPv4 address space, and the unallocated\
    \ address pool\n   in particular.  The address pool has been administered according\
    \ to\n   policies drafted by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\n\
    \   The policies drafted by IANA are effectively policies which are the\n   outcome\
    \ of the same consensus seeking approach used within the\n   Internet Standards\
    \ process, and it is noted that within such an\n   environment unilateral declarations\
    \ of ownership and related\n   assertions of policy control have difficulty in\
    \ asserting an\n   effective role within the Internet community and such declarations\n\
    \   are generally incapable of gathering consensus support (It can be\n   argued\
    \ that \"ownership\" is not a relevant concept within this domain,\n   as the\
    \ essential attribute of such address elements are their\n   uniqueness within\
    \ the global domain, and such an attribute is only\n   feasible through common\
    \ recognition of a coordinated and reliable\n   management environment rather\
    \ than the historical origin of the\n   resource in question).  Secondly there\
    \ is no formal recognition of\n   the address space as being a shared international\
    \ resource which sits\n   within the purview of national public resource management\
    \ policies\n   and administrative entities of each nation, nor is there a\n  \
    \ recognition of the address space as a private resource owned and\n   administered\
    \ by a single entity.\n   Recent policy changes, whereby large segments of the\
    \ unallocated\n   address pool have been assigned to international bodies on a\
    \ regional\n   basis, with further assignment to bodies within national contexts,\n\
    \   have been undertaken with a constant address allocation policy of\n   FCFS,\
    \ OAFA and FREE, and although some effort has been made to\n   increase the deployment\
    \ efficiency through explicit allocation policy\n   enumeration, the general characteristics\
    \ of address allocation are\n   unchanged to date (those characteristics being\
    \ of course FCFS, OAFA\n   and FREE).\n   One potential scenario is to speculate\
    \ that pricing processes imposed\n   by the address allocation agency are not\
    \ feasible within the current\n   Internet environment to the extent that any\
    \ such policies could\n   significantly motivate increased address deployment\
    \ efficiency to the\n   levels required for longer term unallocated address pool\
    \ lifetime\n   extension.  The lack of capability to employ pricing as a managerial\n\
    \   mechanism, even to the extent of cost recovery of the allocation and\n   subsequent\
    \ registry maintenance function has a number of possible\n   longer term outcomes:\n\
    \    a) such functions will be restructured and operated from duly\n       authorised\
    \ national administrative bodies for each nation.\n       Here the observation\
    \ that the address pool delegation sequence\n       within the current Internet\
    \ environment has not to date been\n       aligned with recognised national public\
    \ communications resource\n       administrative entities is an expression of\
    \ the major problem\n       that the unallocated address pool is not recognised\
    \ as being\n       intrinsically the same public resource entity as the radio\n\
    \       spectrum or the telephone number space.  The consequence of\n       this\
    \ mismatch between existing public resource management\n       structures and\
    \ IPv4 address space management implies that\n       public operation for this\
    \ activity on a national basis\n       is not a commonly observed attribute. \
    \ The competency of such\n       established public resource management structures\
    \ in managing\n       what continues to be a remarkably vibrant and dynamic\n\
    \       technology-influenced domain must be questioned.  Potential\n       outcomes\
    \ may possibly include a rational and equitable address\n       space management\
    \ mechanism, but would also in all probability\n       include a cost of a heavy\
    \ damping factor on further\n       technological innovation and refinement of\
    \ the underlying\n       technology base upon which the address space is sited\
    \ as a\n       longer term outcome.\n    b) such functions are operated (and/or\
    \ funded) by Internet Service\n       Providers.  This is a more common scenario\
    \ at present in the\n       Internet IPv4 environment, and although such an operational\n\
    \       environment does admit the potential for adequate funding for\n      \
    \ competent administration of the operation, the strong\n       association of\
    \ these entities who have established interests in\n       the operation of enterprises\
    \ based on the provision of services\n       across the address space (i.e., strong\
    \ interest in exploiting\n       the address space) has a natural tendency to\
    \ express domination\n       of the market by established interests, threatening\
    \ fair access\n       to the common resource and threatening the open market of\n\
    \       deployment of the technology.  It is reasonable to suggest that\n    \
    \   such alignments are undesirable from a public policy\n       perspective.\n\
    \    c) such functions are inadequately funded to service the level of\n     \
    \  activity, and / or administrated informally and consequently\n       managed\
    \ poorly, and the essential attribute of reliable address\n       space management\
    \ is not achieved.\n   It is noted that these issues are largely unresolved within\
    \ the\n   Internet community today, and tensions between established and\n   incoming\
    \ Internet Service providers over equitable access to the\n   unallocated address\
    \ space pool are a consequent risk.\n"

    \   address allocation policies) run the consequent risk of monopoly-\n   based\
    \ restrictive trade and barrier-based pricing as a longer term\n   outcome of\
    \ unallocated address space exhaustion.\n   While free address allocation and\
    \ the adoption of policies which\n   include pricing components both ultimately\
    \ produce an outcome of\n   strong pressure for increased address space utilisation\
    \ efficiency,\n   the removal of the neutral presence of the unallocated address\
    \ pool\n   does induce considerable risk of open market failure within the\n \
    \  Internet itself if free address allocation policies continue until\n   pool\
    \ exhaustion has occurred.\n   Further strengthening of the current FCFS, OAFA\
    \ and FREE address\n   allocation policies, in an effort to induce higher address\n\
    \   utilization efficiencies across the remaining address space is not a\n   viable\
    \ address management strategy refinement, in so far as the\n   trading market\
    \ will then commence before unallocated pool exhaustion,\n   trading in large\
    \ address blocks which are precluded from such\n   strengthened address allocation\
    \ policies.\n   The most negative aspect of this are is that these processes will\n\
    \   erode levels of confidence in the self regulatory capability of the\n   Internet\
    \ community, such that significant doubts will be expressed by\n   the larger\
    \ community the Internet process is one which is appropriate\n   for effective\
    \ formulation of common administrative policy of one of\n   the core common assets\
    \ of the Internet.\n   These outcomes can all be interpreted as policy failure\
    \ outcomes.\n   The seriousness of these outcomes must be assessed in the terms\
    \ of\n   the anticipated timeframe of such policy failure.  Current\n   expectations\
    \ of unallocated address pool lifetime of 6 - 12 years\n   does allow the Internet\
    \ community some time to revisit their methods\n   of administrative process definition,\
    \ but this observation is\n   tempered by the IPv6 process and by increasing levels\
    \ of pressure on\n   the address space in terms of growth in address demand through\
    \ growth\n   of deployment of the Internet itself.\n   It is perhaps an appropriate\
    \ conclusion to acknowledge the\n   impediments of existing processes to admit\
    \ any significant process or\n   policy change that would produce a more efficient\
    \ and effective\n   address space management regime.\n   However it is this policy\
    \ failure to efficiently utilise the IPv4\n   address space through inadequate\
    \ address pool management policies,\n   rather than the exhaustion of the pool\
    \ per se which is perhaps the\n   driving force to design and deploy an evolutionary\
    \ technology to IPv4\n   which possesses as a major attribute a significantly\
    \ larger address\n   space.\n   It is also appropriate to conclude that any outside\
    \ observer of the\n   IPv6 refinement process will look to see if there is any\
    \ evidence of\n   experiential learning in address management policies.  If there\
    \ is to\n   be a successor technology for IPv4 it would be reasonable to\n   anticipate\
    \ that associated address pool management mechanisms show a\n   greater degree\
    \ of understanding of public resource space management\n   capability in the light\
    \ of this experience.  If no such evidence is\n   forthcoming then there is no\
    \ clear mechanism to instil sufficient\n   levels of consumer and industry confidence\
    \ in such technologies in\n   such a way which would admit large scale public\
    \ deployment,\n   irrespective of the technical attributes of the successor technology.\n\
    \   Such potential mechanisms may include pricing components irrespective\n  \
    \ of the actual size of the address resource, given that the number's\n   uniqueness\
    \ is a resource with inherent market value irrespective of\n   whether scarcity\
    \ pricing premiums are relevant in such an address\n   space.\n   It is also appropriate\
    \ to conclude that continuation of current\n   address space management policies\
    \ run a very strong risk of\n   restrictive and monopoly-based trading in address\
    \ space, with\n   consequence of the same trading practices being expressed within\
    \ the\n   deployed Internet itself.\n   The immediate action considered to be\
    \ most appropriately aligned to\n   both the interests of the Internet community\
    \ and the broader public\n   community is to examine Internet address space management\
    \ structures\n   which include pricing as well as policy components within the\
    \ overall\n   management mechanism, and to examine the application of such\n \
    \  mechanisms to both the existing IPv4 address space, and to that of\n   any\
    \ refinement or successor Internet technology base.\n"
