  - "             IMP/TIP Memory Retrofit Schedule (Revision 2)\nThis revision contains\
    \ two types of changes to RFC #447.  First, the\nretrofits to Utah, Belvoir, NOAA,\
    \ USC, Stanford, ISI, Case, and CCA have\nbeen completed and are therefore removed\
    \ from the schedule.  Second, the\nretrofits to UCSB, ETAC, Aberdeen, and Rome\
    \ have been rescheduled.\nThe revised text of RFC #447 follows:\nDuring the first\
    \ several months of 1973 we will be retrofitting each IMP\nand TIP with additional\
    \ core memory.  At the end of the retrofit\nprogram, the memory sizes of the various\
    \ machines will be as follows:\n    IMP (516 or 316) - 16K words\n    TIP - 28K\
    \ words\n    TIP with Magnetic Tape Option - 32K words\nIn addition, the expansion\
    \ of the TIP core memory will necessitate\nenlarging the TIP to two cabinets.\n\
    Listed below is the schedule for the remaining retrofits.  We have\narranged this\
    \ schedule to coincide with the usual monthly Preventive\nMaintenance at each\
    \ site so as to minimize user inconvenience, but the\nwork required will frequently\
    \ require the machines to be down longer\nthan normal.  I will issue additional\
    \ RFC's updating this schedule as\nnecessary.\nAny site which anticipates difficulty\
    \ with the expansion of TIP size,\nand thus the floor space requirement, should\
    \ contact Hawley Rising (BBN)\nat\n    (617)491-1850 ext. 473\nAll dates given\
