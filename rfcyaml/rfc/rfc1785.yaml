- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The TFTP option negotiation mechanism, proposed in [1], is a\n \
    \  backward-compatible extension to the TFTP protocol, defined in [2].\n   It\
    \ allows file transfer options to be negotiated prior to the\n   transfer using\
    \ a mechanism which is consistent with TFTP's Request\n   Packet format.  The\
    \ mechanism is kept simple by enforcing a request-\n   respond-acknowledge sequence,\
    \ similar to the lock-step approach taken\n   by TFTP itself.\n   This document\
    \ was written to allay concerns that the presence of\n   options in a TFTP Request\
    \ packet might cause pathological behavior on\n   servers which do not support\
    \ TFTP option negotiation.\n"
- title: Test Results
  contents:
  - "Test Results\n   A TFTP client, modified to send TFTP options, was tested against\
    \ five\n   unmodified servers:\n      DEC   DEC 3000/400 alpha   OSF1 V3.0\n \
    \     SGI   IP17 mips            IRIX 5.2\n      SUN   sun4c sparc          SunOS\
    \ 5.1\n      IBM   RS/6000 Model 320    AIX 3.4\n      SUN   sun4m           \
    \     SunOS 4.1.3\n   In each case, the servers ignored the option information\
    \ in the\n   Request packet and the transfer proceeded as though no option\n \
    \  negotiation had been attempted.  In addition, the standard BSD4.3\n   source\
    \ for TFTPD, the starting point for many implementations, was\n   examined.  The\
    \ code clearly ignores any extraneous information in\n   Request packets.\n  \
    \ From these results and examinations, it is clear that the TFTP option\n   negotiation\
    \ mechanism is fully backward-compatible with unmodified\n   TFTP servers.\n"
