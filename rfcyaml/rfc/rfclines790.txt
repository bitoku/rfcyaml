755, 750, 739, 604, 503, 433, 349 ASSIGNED NUMBERS
This Network Working Group Request for Comments documents the currently assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.
This RFC will be updated periodically, and in any case current information can be obtained from Jon Postel.
The assignment of numbers is also handled by Jon.
If you are developing a protocol or application that will require the use of a link, socket, port, protocol, or network number please contact Jon to receive a number assignment.

POSTEL@ISIF Most of the protocols mentioned here are documented in the RFC series of notes.
The more prominent and more generally used are documented in the Protocol Handbook [17] prepared by the Network Information Center (NIC).
Some of the items listed are undocumented.
In all cases the name and mailbox of the responsible individual is indicated.
In the lists that follow, a bracketed entry, e.g., [17,iii], at the right hand margin of the page indicates a reference for the listed protocol, where the number cites the document and the "iii" cites the person.
Assigned Numbers Network Numbers ASSIGNED NETWORK NUMBERS
This list of network numbers is used in the internet address [33].
The Internet Protocol (IP) uses a 32 bit address and divides that address into a network part and a "rest" or local address part.
The division takes 3 forms or classes.
The first type, or class a, of address has a 7 bit network number and a 24 bit local address.
This allows 128 class a networks.
The second type, or class b, of address has a 14 bit network number and a 16 bit local address.
This allows 16,384 class b networks.
The third type, or class c, of address has a 21 bit network number and a 8 bit local address.
This allows 2,097,152 class c networks.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
For example, the internet address of ISIF is 010.020.000.052.
This notation will be used in the listing of assigned network Assigned Numbers Network Numbers numbers.
The class a networks will have nnn.rrr.rrr.rrr, the class b networks will have nnn.nnn.rrr.rrr, and the class c networks will have nnn.nnn.nnn.rrr, where nnn represents part or all of a network number and rrr represents part or all of a local address or rest field.

In the Internet Protocol (IP) [33] there is a field to identify the version of the internetwork general protocol.
This field is 4 bits in size.
[JBP] Assigned Numbers Internet Protocol Numbers ASSIGNED INTERNET PROTOCOL NUMBERS
In the Internet Protocol (IP)
[33] there is a field, called Protocol, to identify the the next level protocol.
This is an 8 bit field.
Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers Decimal
[JBP] Assigned Numbers Port or Socket Numbers ASSIGNED
PORT or SOCKET NUMBERS Ports are used in the TCP [34] and sockets are used in the AHHP [28,17] to name the ends of logical connections which carry long term conversations.
For the purpose of providing services to unknown callers a service contact socket is defined.
This list specifies the port or socket used by the server process as its contact socket.
In the AHHP an Initial Connection Procedure ICP [39,17] is used between the user process and the server process to make the initial contact and establish the long term connections leaving the contact socket free to handle other callers.
In the TCP no ICP is necessary since a port may engage in many simultaneous connections.
To the extent possible these same port assignments are used with UDP [42].
The assigned ports/sockets use a small part of the possible port/socket numbers.
The assigned ports/sockets have all except the low order eight bits cleared to zero.
The low order eight bits are specified here.

The word "link" here refers to a field in the original ARPANET Host/IMP interface leader.
The link was originally defined as an 8 bit field.
Some time after the ARPANET Host to Host (AHHP) protocol was defined and, by now, some time ago the definition of this field was changed to "Message ID" and the length to 12 bits.
The name link now refers to the high order 8 bits of this 12 bit message id field.
The low order 4 bits of the message
id field are to be zero unless specifically specified otherwise for the particular protocol used on that link.
The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN report 1822 [1].
