  - "The Plan\n   Introduction\n      Domain style names are being introduced in the\
    \ Internet to allow a\n      controlled delegation of the authority and responsibility\
    \ for\n      adding hosts to the system.  This also allows a subdivision of the\n\
    \      task of maintaining information about hosts.\n      The subdivision will\
    \ be based on administrative authority or\n      organization boundaries (not\
    \ necessarily network boundaries).\n      Certain requirements will be placed\
    \ on organizations wishing to be\n      \"top level\" domains.  Initially, all\
    \ the hosts in the Internet\n      will be in the domain \"ARPA\".  As soon as\
    \ is practical a second\n      domain, \"DDN\", will be introduced.  Other domains\
    \ may be added\n      after that, provided the requirements listed below are met.\n\
    \      Domain names will be supported in the long run by a system of\n      special\
    \ servers called \"domain servers\" which will be used to\n      translate names\
    \ to addresses.  While this system of domain servers\n      is being created and\
    \ programs are being converted to use them, the\n      existing host tables will\
    \ evolve to include domain style names.\n      The domain server design also provides\
    \ for mapping mailbox\n      addresses to the host name of the mail server for\
    \ that mailbox.\n      This feature allows mailboxes to be related to an organization\n\
    \      rather than to a specific host.\n      This plan will be implemented in\
    \ the ARPA community.  After the\n      domain system is demonstrated in the ARPA\
    \ community, the DDN\n      Program Management Office (DDN-PMO) will determine\
    \ the schedule\n      for implementation of the domain system in the DDN community.\n\
    \      This approach will cause some extra steps in the ARPA community\n     \
    \ implementation, and may limit communication between the ARPA and\n      DDN\
    \ communities in some ways.  The details and implications of\n      this two phase\
    \ approach are discussed more fully below.\n"

    \ A Catch 22\n      There is a problem in introducing domain style names: a great\
    \ deal\n      of software has to be changed.  Some groups would like to start\n\
    \      using domain style names right away, and other groups don't want\n    \
    \  to see them or use them for a very long time.  Communication\n      patterns\
    \ are very complex and as soon as domain style names are\n      allowed and used\
    \ by a few groups they will start showing up almost\n      everywhere.  This argues\
    \ that everyone should be prepared for them\n      before they are used at all.\
    \  However, we know that with people\n      being people and with so many of people\
    \ involved, the probability\n      of everyone being ready in any reasonable time\
    \ period is nearly\n      zero.  The way out of this situation is to set up a\
    \ reasonable\n      schedule for experimenting with domain style names and authorizing\n\
    \      their use.  People that get ready on schedule should have no\n      problems\
    \ with these names.\n   Evolution of the Table\n      Nearly all the hosts in\
    \ the Internet now use some form of host\n      table based on the master file\
    \ \"HOSTS.TXT\" maintained by the\n      Network Information Center (NIC).\n \
    \     One way to introduce domain style names is to add to the entries\n     \
    \ in this table names in the domain style.  In particular, make the\n      first\
    \ name in each entry the official host name in the ARPA\n      domain.\n     \
    \    For example, the current entry for USC-ISIF is:\n            HOST : 10.2.0.52\
    \ : USC-ISIF,ISIF : DEC-1090T : TOPS20 :\n            TCP/TELNET,TCP/SMTP,TCP/FTP,TCP/FINGER,UDP/TFTP\
    \ :\n         This could become:\n            HOST : 10.2.0.52 : USC-ISIF.ARPA,USC-ISIF,ISIF\
    \ : DEC-1090T :\n            TOPS20 : TCP/TELNET,TCP/SMTP,TCP/FTP,TCP/FINGER,UDP/TFTP\
    \ :\n      For some hosts and programs this could be done today with no\n    \
    \  disruptions, but for others substantial problems could occur.  For\n      example,\
    \ with over five hundred entries in the table the addition\n      of 500 names\
    \ could exceed the space allocated to store the table\n      in some programs.\
    \  (One could argue that these programs are going\n      to blow up soon anyway\
    \ as new host entries are added to the\n      table.)  Another problem is that\
    \ period (or dot, \".\") is not now a\n      legal character in host names and\
    \ some programs may not be able to\n      parse these new names.\n"

    \    The plan is to make such a domain style name table available in\n      parallel\
    \ with the regular table for a few months, then to replace\n      the regular\
    \ table with this domain style table.  The dates for\n      these changes is given\
    \ in the schedule below.\n      So far, no new domains have been introduced. \
    \ Only a table with\n      all the entries having official names in the ARPA domain\
    \ has been\n      provided.  This should allow programs to be constructed to deal\n\
    \      with domain style names in a general way without any special hacks\n  \
    \    to add or delete the string \".ARPA\" to or from host names.\n      The introduction\
    \ of new domains is tied to the provision of domain\n      servers by those domains.\
    \  As new domains meet the requirements\n      and are authorized they will also\
    \ be added to the host table.  No\n      new domains will be added before master\
    \ table is converted to the\n      domain style entries.\n      In the long run\
    \ the Internet will become too complex and change\n      too fast to keep a master\
    \ table of all the hosts.  At some point\n      the master table will be reduced\
    \ to simply the entries for the\n      domain servers for the top level domains.\
    \  By this time all normal\n      translation of host names into addresses should\
    \ take place by\n      consulting domain servers.\n   Conversion to Servers\n\
    \      As soon as domain servers become available programs should be\n      converted\
    \ to use them to translate names into addresses.  The\n      details of these\
    \ procedures are given in RFCs 882 and 883.\n      The general idea is that a\
    \ host no longer keeps a complete host\n      table but rather makes a request\
    \ on the domain server each time a\n      name must be translated to an address.\
    \  The code module in the\n      host that implements the protocol to do this\
    \ is called a\n      \"resolver\".  The resolver may keep a cache of recently\
    \ translated\n      names and addresses for improved performance.\n      Many\
    \ hosts have a library function or system call that is used to\n      access the\
    \ host table to translate names to addresses.  It ought\n      to be possible\
    \ to replace this function or call with the resolver\n      module such that most\
    \ programs would not know which method was\n      used to accomplish the name\
    \ to address translation.\n"

    \ Requirements on a Domain\n      There are several requirements that must be\
    \ met to establish a\n      domain.  In general it must be responsibly managed.\
    \  There must be\n      a responsible person to serve as a coordinator for domain\
    \ related\n      questions,  there must be a robust name service, it must be of\
    \ at\n      least a minimum size,  and the domain must be registered with the\n\
    \      central domain administrator.\n      Responsible Person:\n         An individual\
    \ must be identified who has authority for the\n         administration of the\
    \ names within the domain, and who takes\n         responsibility for the behavior\
    \ of the hosts in the domain in\n         their interactions with hosts outside\
    \ the domain.\n         The operation of a name server should not be taken on\
    \ lightly.\n         There are some difficult problems in providing an adequate\n\
    \         service, primarily the problems in keeping the data base up to\n   \
    \      date, and keeping the service operating.\n         If some host in a domain\
    \ somehow misbehaves in interactions\n         with hosts outside the domain (e.g.,\
    \ consistently violates\n         protocols), the responsible person for the domain\
    \ must be able\n         to take action to eliminate the problem.\n      Domain\
    \ Servers:\n         A robust and reliable domain service must be provided.  One\
    \ way\n         of meeting this requirement is to provide at least two\n     \
    \    independent domain servers for the domain.  The data base can,\n        \
    \ of course, be the same.  The database can be prepared and\n         copied to\
    \ each domain server.  But, the servers should be in\n         separate machines\
    \ on independent power supplies, et cetera;\n         basically as physically\
    \ independent as can be and yet in the\n         same domain.  They should have\
    \ no common point of failure.\n         One of the difficult problems in operating\
    \ a domain server is\n         the acquisition and maintenance of the data.  In\
    \ this case the\n         data is the host names and addresses.  In some environments\n\
    \         this information changes fairly rapidly and keeping up-to-date\n   \
    \      data may be difficult.  This is one motivation for sub-domains.\n     \
    \    One may wish to create sub-domains until the rate of change of\n        \
    \ the data in a sub-domain domain server data base is easily\n         managed.\n\
    \         The concepts and implementation details of the domain server\n     \
    \    are given in RFCs 882 and 883.\n"

    \    Minimum Size:\n         The domain must be of at least a minimum size.  Several\n\
    \         measures of size may be used in combination in making this\n       \
    \  test.  Measures may include: (a) the number of host computers\n         in\
    \ the domain, (b) the number of people with primary mailboxes\n         in the\

    \ for these measures will be\n         established before new domains are authorized.\n\

    \    hosts is above the minimum size.\n      Registration:\n         The administrator\
    \ must register the domain with the central\n         authority.  The central\
    \ authority must be satisfied that the\n         requirements are met before authorization\
    \ for the domain is\n         granted.\n         The administrator of a domain\

    \ a sub-domain\n         administrator.\n   Mailbox Support\n      The design\
    \ of the domain servers provides two levels of support\n      for mail.\n    \
    \  The first, called \"agent binding\", is that the right hand part of\n     \
    \ the typical mail box (Y in X@Y) can be mapped a host that will\n      either\
    \ accept the mail as the destination or accept the mail for\n      forwarding.\n\
    \      The second, called \"mailbox binding\", is to map the entire mailbox\n\
    \      (X@Y) to a destination (this mechanism can also support some\n      mailing\
    \ list functions).\n      Agent binding can be used to establish mailboxes that\
    \ are based on\n      an organization name rather than a host name.\n        \

    \ scheme of a centrally maintained table\n      copied periodically by each host.\

    \ community, the DDN-PMO\n      will establish a schedule for implementing the\
    \ domain system in\n      the DDN community.\n      This means that there may\
    \ be a period of a year or more with the\n      two communities using different\
    \ schemes for distributing\n      information about host names and addresses.\n\
    \      Specifically:\n         The NIC will maintain a table a \"HOSTS.TXT\" style\
    \ table for use\n         by DDN hosts.  This table will contain domain style\
    \ names for\n         all DDN hosts (e.g., USC-ISIA.DDN).  Since this is the only\n\

    \ Internet Addresses, this table must also contain names and\n         addresses\
    \ of ARPA community hosts of interest to DDN users\n         (e.g., USC-ISIF.ARPA).\n\
    \         There will be a domain server with data for the DDN domain.\n      \
    \   That is, hosts in the ARPA community that use the domain system\n        \
    \ of resolvers and servers will be able to access servers that\n         have\
    \ the data base covering the DDN community.\n      It is quite likely that the\
