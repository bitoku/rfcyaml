Internet Protocol Handbook Table of Contents
The internet family of protocols is replacing the old ARPANET protocols.
To this end an Internet Protocol Handbook will be prepared by the Network Information Center.
This Handbook is tentatively planned to be available at the end of 1980.
This Internet Protocol Handbook will closely parallel the old ARPANET Protocol Handbook, and will primarily be a collection of existing RFCs and IENs.
Attached is the current draft table of contents for the Internet Protocol Handbook.
Any suggestions for additions should be sent to Jon Postel (Postel@ISIF).
the Network Information Center online Library at SRI KL via FTP using the FTP user name ANONYMOUS and password GUEST.
The IENs have pathnames of the form "<NETINFO>IEN nnn.
TXT", and the RFCs have pathnames of the form "<NETINFO
TXT", where "nnn" is replaced by the document number.
[Note the inconsistency: IENs have a hyphen in the pathname, Internet Protocol Handbook Table of Contents Overview
IEN 142 Name Server Protocol
