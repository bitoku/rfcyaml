  - "            Reallocation in Case of Input Error\nIn case of reading a message\
    \ from the IMP, it may be impossible for the\nreceiving NCP to determine the length\
    \ of the message if an input error\noccurs. The following protocol will be used\
    \ at the CCN-Host at UCLA to\nresynchronize flow control.\nIf an input error is\
    \ detected and the NCP can find the intended link\nnumber, it will send a GVB\
    \ with frac = O to the sending Host and disregard\nfurther incoming messages on\
    \ that link. When the RET has been received, a\nnew ALL will be sent.\nIf the\
    \ sending Host is not waiting for a RFNM when the GVB arrives, it will\nsend the\
    \ RET immediately. If it is waiting for a RFNM corresponding to the\nmessage with\
    \ the error or a RFNM corresponding to a following message, it\nwill send the\
    \ RET after the RFNM has been received.\nIn this way, the receiving Host will\
    \ know that the link is clear before it\nissues a new ALL.\nTS/rb.\n     [ This\
    \ RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n     [ into the online RFC\
    \ archives by Alexandra Weikert 7/97]\n"
