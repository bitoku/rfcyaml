  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobile IPv4 message types range from 0 to 255.  This document\n
    \  reserves a message type for experimental purposes, to evaluate\n   enhancements
    to Mobile IPv4 messages before a formal standards\n   proposal is issued.\n   Without
    experimental message capability, one would have to select a\n   type value from
    the range defined for IANA assignment, which may\n   result in collisions.\n   Within
    a message, Mobile IP defines a general extension mechanism\n   allowing optional
    information to be carried by Mobile IP control\n   messages.  Extensions are not
    skippable if defined in the range [0-\n   127] and are skippable if defined in
    the range [128-255].  This\n   document reserves extension types in both the skippable
    and non-\n   skippable ranges for experimental use.\n   Mobile IPv4 defines error
    codes for use by the FA [64-127] and HA\n   [128-192].  This document reserves
    an error code in both of these\n   ranges for experimental use.\n   The definition
    of experimental numbers in this document is made\n   according to the recommendation
    of Section 2.2 of BCP 82, RFC 3692.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].\n   In addition,
    this document frequently uses the following terms:\n   EXP-MSG-TYPE: A Mobile-IPv4
    message number assigned for experimental\n   use.  IANA has assigned message number
    255 for this.\n   EXP-SKIP-EXT-TYPE: A Mobile-IPv4 and ICMP router discovery Agent\n
    \  Advertisement extension number assigned for experimental use.  IANA\n   has
    assigned extension number 255 for this.\n   EXP-NONSKIP-EXT-TYPE: A Mobile-IPv4
    and ICMP router discovery Agent\n   Advertisement extension number for experimental
    use.  IANA has\n   assigned extension number 127 for this.\n   EXP-HA-ERROR-CODE:
    A Mobile-IPv4 error code for use by the HA in\n   MIPv4 reply messages to indicate
    an error condition.  IANA has\n   assigned error code 192 for this.\n   EXP-FA-ERROR-CODE:
    A Mobile-IPv4 error code for use by FA in reply\n   messages to indicate an error
    condition.  IANA has assigned error\n   code 127 for this.\n   Mobility Entity:
    Entities as defined in [2] (home agent, foreign\n   agent, and mobile node).\n"

  - "3.  Experimental Message\n   As the nature and purpose of an experimental message
    cannot be known\n   in advance, the structure is defined as having an opaque payload.\n
    \  Entities implementing the message can interpret the message according\n   to
    their implementation.  Interpreting based on extensions present in\n   the message
    is one suggestion.\n   These messages may be used between the mobility entities
    (Home Agent,\n   Foreign Agent, and Mobile Node).  Experimental messages MUST
    be\n   authenticated using any of the authentication mechanisms defined for\n
    \  Mobile IP ([2], [5]).\n   This message MAY contain extensions defined in Mobile
    IP, including\n   vendor-specific extensions [4].\n   IP fields:\n      Source
    Address: Typically the interface address from which\n      the message is sent.\n
    \     Destination Address: The address of the agent or the Mobile\n      Node.\n
    \  UDP fields:\n      Source Port        Set according to RFC 768 (variable)\n

    structure defined only\n              by the particular experiment it is used
    for.\n   Once an experimental message has been tested and shown to be useful,\n
    \  a permanent number should be obtained through the normal IANA numbers\n   assignment
    procedures.\n   A single experimental message type is defined.  This message can\n
    \  contain extensions based on which the message can be interpreted.\n   Up-to-date
    values for the message types for Mobile IP control\n   messages are specified
    in the most recent \"Assigned Numbers\" [3].\n"

    entities that don't understand\n   the non-skippable experimental extensions MUST
    silently discard the\n   message containing them.  This behavior is consistent
    with section\n   1.8 of [2].\n   Foreign Agents and Home Agents SHOULD include
    an experimental error\n   code in a reply message only if they have a general
    indication that\n   the receiving entity would be able to parse it.  This is indicated
