  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 4291 [RFC4291] defines \"scop\" as \"a 4-bit multicast
    scope value\n   used to limit the scope of the multicast group\" and defines \"scop
    3\"\n   as \"reserved\".  The multicast protocol specification in [MPL] desires\n
    \  to use multicast scop 3 to transport multicast traffic scoped to a\n   network
    of nodes connected in a mesh.  This scop value is used to\n   accommodate a multicast
    scope that is greater than Link-Local but is\n   also automatically determined
    by the network architecture.\n"

    \  The following change is applied to Section 2.7 of [RFC4291].\n   OLD:\n      Admin-Local
    scope is the smallest scope that must be\n      administratively configured, i.e.,
    not automatically derived from\n      physical connectivity or other, non-multicast-related\n
    \     configuration.\n   NEW:\n      Interface-Local, Link-Local, and Realm-Local
    scope boundaries are\n      automatically derived from physical connectivity or
    other non-\n      multicast-related configurations.  Global scope has no boundary.\n
    \     The boundaries of all other non-reserved scopes of Admin-Local or\n      larger
    are administratively configured.  For reserved scopes, the\n      way of configuring
    their boundaries will be defined when the\n      semantics of the scope are defined.\n
    \     According to RFC 4007 [RFC4007], the zone of a Realm-Local scope\n      must
    fall within zones of larger scope.  Because the zone of a\n      Realm-Local scope
    is configured automatically while the zones of\n      larger scopes are configured
    manually, care must be taken in the\n      definition of those larger scopes to
    ensure that the inclusion\n      constraint is met.\n      Realm-Local scopes
    created by different network technologies are\n      considered to be independent
    and will have different zone indices\n      (see Section 6 of [RFC4007]).  A router
    with interfaces on links\n      using different network technologies does not
    forward traffic\n      between the Realm-Local multicast scopes defined by those\n
    \     technologies.\n"

  - "3.  Definition of Realm-Local Scopes\n   The definition of any Realm-Local scope
    for a particular network\n   technology should be published in an RFC.  For example,
    such a scope\n   definition would be appropriate for publication in an \"IPv6-over-foo\"\n
    \  RFC.\n   Any RFCs that include the definition of a Realm-Local scope will be\n
    \  added to the IANA \"IPv6 Multicast Address Scopes\" registry under the\n   Realm-Local
    scope entry, and those specifications must include such a\n   request in their
    IANA Considerations.\n   Section 5 of this document gives the definition of scop
    3 for IEEE\n   802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4] networks.\n"

    \  disagree on the way in which multicast scop 3 is configured.  To\n   resolve
    that disagreement, the last bullet in the list in Section 5\n   of [RFC4007] is
    updated as follows:\n   OLD:\n   o  The boundaries of zones of a scope other than
    interface-local,\n      link-local, and global must be defined and configured
    by network\n      administrators.\n   NEW:\n   o  The boundaries of zones of a
    scope are defined by the IPv6\n      addressing architecture [RFC4291] and updated
    by RFC 7346.\n"

    Multicast Address\n   Scopes\" in the existing \"IPv6 Multicast Address Space
    Registry\".  The\n   new registry has been populated with the scop values given
    in\n   Section 2.  New definitions for scop values will be made following\n   the
    \"IETF Review\" policy [RFC5226].\n   For each future RFC that defines a Realm-Local
    scope for new network\n   technologies (scop 3), IANA will add a reference to
    the defining\n   document in the \"IPv6 Multicast Address Scopes\" registry.  Such
    RFCs\n   are expected to make an explicit request to IANA for inclusion in the\n
    \  registry.\n   IANA has included a note on the top of the \"IPv6 Multicast Address\n
    \  Scopes\" registry:\n      The definition of any Realm-Local scope for a particular
    network\n      technology should be published in an RFC.  For example, such a\n
    \     scope definition would be appropriate for publication in an 'IPv6-\n      over-foo'
    RFC.\n      Any RFCs that define a Realm-Local scope will be listed in this\n
    \     registry as an additional reference in the Realm-Local scope\n      entry.
    \ Such RFCs are expected to make an explicit request to IANA\n      for inclusion
    in this registry.\n"
