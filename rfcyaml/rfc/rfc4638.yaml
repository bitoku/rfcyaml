    \ PPPoE [1]\n   sessions in a combined Ethernet/Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)\n\
    \   setup, as shown in Figure 1, to more intelligent PPPoE-capable\n   Residential\
    \ Gateway (RG) and Gigabit Ethernet/ATM broadband network\n   designs, as shown\
    \ in Figures 2 and 3, the need to increase the\n   maximum transmit and receive\
    \ unit in the PPPoE protocol is becoming\n   more important in order to reduce\

    \ 1.  Initial broadband network designs with PPPoE\n   In the network design shown\
    \ in Figure 1, fragmentation is typically\n   not a problem, since the subscriber\
    \ session is PPPoE end to end from\n   the PC to the BRAS.  Therefore, a PPP-negotiated\
    \ MRU of 1492 octets\n   is fully acceptable, as it makes the largest PPPoE frame\
    \ adhere to\n   the standard Ethernet MTU of 1500 octets.\n         <----- IPoE\

    \ 2.  Next-generation broadband network designs with PPPoE\n   In the network\
    \ design shown in Figure 2, fragmentation becomes a\n   major problem, since the\
    \ subscriber session is a combination of IPoE\n   and PPPoE.  The IPoE typically\
    \ uses a Maximum Transit Unit (MTU) of\n   1500 octets.  However, when the Residential\
    \ Gateway and the Broadband\n   Remote Access Server (BRAS) are the PPPoE session\

    \ typically negotiates a 1500-\n   octet MRU.  Widely deployed PPP/PPPoA hosts\
    \ in Customer Premises\n   Equipment (CPE) do not support a 1492-octet MRU, which\
    \ creates an\n   issue in turn for the BRAS (PPPoE server) if strict compliance\
    \ to RFC\n   2516 [1] is mandated.  For PPP/PPPoA hosts capable of negotiating\
    \ a\n   1492-octet MRU size, then we are back to a fragmentation issue.\n"

- title: 3.  Proposed Solution
  contents:
  - "3.  Proposed Solution\n   The procedure described in this document does not strictly\
    \ conform to\n   IEEE standards for Ethernet packet size but relies on a widely\n\
    \   deployed behavior of supporting frames with Ethernet packet format,\n   but\
    \ exceeding the maximum packet lengths defined by [4].\n   Since next-generation\
    \ broadband networks are built around Ethernet\n   systems supporting baby-giants\
    \ and jumbo frames with payload sizes\n   larger than the normal Ethernet MTU\
    \ of 1500 octets, a BRAS acting as\n   a PPPoE server MUST support PPPoE MRU negotiations\
    \ larger than 1492\n   octets in order to limit the amount of fragmented packets\
    \ in networks\n   similar to those described in Section 1.\n   By default, the\
    \ Maximum-Receive-Unit (MRU) option MUST follow the\n   rules set forward in RFC\
    \ 1661 [2] but MUST NOT be negotiated to a\n   size larger than 1492 to guarantee\
    \ compatibility with Ethernet\n   network segments limited to 1500-octet frames.\
    \  In such a case, as\n   the PPPoE header is 6 octets and the PPP Protocol ID\
    \ is 2 octets, the\n   PPP MRU MUST NOT be greater than 1492.\n   An optional\
    \ PPPoE tag, \"PPP-Max-Payload\", allows a PPPoE client to\n   override this default\
    \ behavior by providing a maximum size for the\n   PPP payload it can support\
    \ in both the sending and receiving\n   directions.  When such a tag is received\
    \ by the PPPoE server, the\n   server MAY allow the negotiation of an MRU larger\
    \ than 1492 and the\n   use of an MTU larger than 1492, subject to limitations\
    \ of its local\n   configuration and according to the rules set forward in RFC\
    \ 1661 [2],\n   within the limits of the maximum payload size indicated by the\
    \ PPPoE\n   client.\n"
- title: 4.  PPPoE Discovery Stage
  contents:
  - "4.  PPPoE Discovery Stage\n   If a PPPoE client wants to use an MTU/MRU higher\
    \ than 1492 octets,\n   then it MUST include an optional PPP-Max-Payload Tag in\
    \ the PADI and\n   PADR packets.  If the PPPoE server can support an MTU/MRU higher\
    \ than\n   1492 octets, it MUST respond with an echo of the clients tag in the\n\
    \   PADO and PADS packets when the PPP-Max-Payload tag is received from\n   the\

    \ the PPP payload; therefore it is directly comparable with\n   the value used\

- title: 5.1.  MRU Negotiations
  contents:
  - "5.1.  MRU Negotiations\n   Since Ethernet (without jumbo frames) has a maximum\
    \ payload size of\n   1500 octets, the PPPoE header is 6 octets, and the PPP Protocol\
    \ ID is\n   2 octets, the Maximum-Receive-Unit (MRU) option MUST NOT be\n   negotiated\
    \ to a size larger than 1492, unless both the PPPoE client\n   and server have\
    \ indicated the ability to support a larger MRU in the\n   PPPoE Discovery Stage.\n\
    \   The initial MRU negotiation for the PPP/PPPoE server MUST follow a\n   flow\
    \ as shown below:\n   If PPPoE {\n   PPP_MRU_Max = 1492\n   If (PPP-Max-Payload-Tag)\
    \ AND (PPP-Max-Payload-Tag > 1492)\n   Then PPP_MRU_Max = min (PPP-Max-Payload-Tag,\
    \ Interface MTU-8)\n   }\n   \"Normal\" PPP_MRU_Negotiation (PPP_MRU_Max)\n  \
    \ If the PPP-Max-Payload tag is present and greater than 1492, it MUST\n   be\
    \ considered along with the server's interface MTU settings when the\n   maximum\
    \ value is selected for the normal RFC 1661 [2] MRU negotiation\n   which decides\
    \ the actual MRU to use.\n   If the PPP-Max-Payload tag isn't present or is present\
    \ but below\n   1492, then the existing MRU constraint of 1492 octets MUST stay\n\
    \   applicable, thus preserving backward compatibility.\n   This, in summary,\
    \ indicates the following behavior:\n   1.  When a \"PPP-Max-Payload\" tag is\
    \ received,\n      a. the value in this tag will indicate the maximum MRU allowed\
    \ to\n         be accepted or suggested in an MRU negotiation; and\n      b. if\
    \ MRU is not negotiated, then RFC 1661 [2] will set the\n         default MRU\
    \ at 1500.  This will say that the \"PPP-Max-Payload\"\n         tag can have\
    \ a value greater than 1500, but in this case RFC\n         1661 [2] sets the\
    \ default MRU to 1500, and only if MRU is\n         negotiated higher (up to maximum\
    \ payload) will the \"PPP-Max-\n         Payload\" tag value be used.\n   2. \
    \ When a \"PPP-Max-Payload\" tag is not received by either end, then\n       RFC\
    \ 2516 [1] sets the rule.\n"
- title: 5.2.  MRU Test and Troubleshooting
  contents:
  - "5.2.  MRU Test and Troubleshooting\n   If the MRU is negotiated to a value larger\
    \ than 1492 octets, the\n   sending side SHOULD have the option of sending one\
    \ or more MRU-sized\n   Echo-Request packets once the session is opened.  This\
    \ allows it to\n   test that the receiving side and any intermediate Ethernet\
    \ segments\n   and equipment can handle such a packet size.\n   If no Echo-Replies\
    \ are received, the sending side MAY choose to\n   repeat the test with 1492 octets\
    \ Echo-Request packets.  If these\n   packets receive replies, the sending side\
    \ MUST not send packets\n   bigger than 1492 octets for this session.\n   This\
    \ capability SHOULD be enabled by default.  It SHOULD be\n   configurable and\
    \ MAY be disabled on networks where there is some\n   prior knowledge indicating\
    \ that the test is not necessary.\n"
