  - "Abstract\n   Protocols such as ARP and Neighbor Discovery have data fields that\n\
    \   contain link-layer addresses. In order to interoperate properly, a\n   sender\
    \ setting such a field must insure that the receiver extracts\n   those bits and\
    \ interprets them correctly.  In most cases, such fields\n   must be in \"canonical\
    \ form\".  Unfortunately, not all LAN adaptors are\n   consistent in their use\
    \ of canonical form, and implementations may\n   need to explicitly bit swap individual\
    \ bytes in order to obtain the\n   correct format.  This document provides information\
    \ to implementors\n   to help them avoid the pitfall of using non-canonical forms\
    \ when\n   canonical forms are required.\n"

- title: 2.  Canonical Form
  contents:
  - "2.  Canonical Form\n   Canonical form (also known as \"LSB format\" and \"Ethernet\
    \ format\") is\n   the name given to the format of a LAN adapter address as it\
    \ should be\n   presented to the user according to the 802 LAN standard.  It is\
    \ best\n   defined as how the bit order of an adapter address on the LAN media\n\
    \   maps to the bit order of an adapter address in memory: The first bit\n   of\
    \ each byte that appears on the LAN maps to the least significant\n   (i.e., right-most)\
    \ bit of each byte in memory (the figure below\n   illustrates this).  This puts\
    \ the group address indicator (i.e., the\n   bit that defines whether an address\
    \ is unicast or multicast) in the\n   least significant bit of the first byte.\
    \  Ethernet and 802.3 hardware\n   behave consistently with this definition.\n\
    \   Unfortunately, Token Ring (and some FDDI) hardware does not behave\n   consistently\
    \ with this definition; it maps the first bit of each byte\n   of the adapter\
    \ address to the most significant (i.e., left-most) bit\n   of each byte in memory,\
    \ which puts the group address indicator in the\n   most significant bit of the\
    \ first byte.  This mapping is variously\n   called \"MSB format\", \"IBM format\"\
    , \"Token-Ring format\", and \"non-\n   canonical form\".  The figure below illustrates\
    \ the difference between\n   canonical and non-canonical form using the canonical\
    \ form address\n   12-34-56-78-9A-BC as an example:\n   In memory,      12   \
    \    34       56       78       9A       BC\n   canonical:   00010010 00110100\
    \ 01010110 01111000 10011010 10111100\n                1st bit appearing on LAN\
    \ (group address indicator)\n                |\n   On LAN:      01001000 00101100\
    \ 01101010 00011110 01011001 00111101\n   In memory,\n   MSB format:  01001000\
    \ 00101100 01101010 00011110 01011001 00111101\n                   48       2C\
    \       6A       1E       59       3D\n   The implication of this inconsistency\
    \ is that addresses extracted\n   from adaptors, assigned to adaptors, or extracted\
    \ from link-layer\n   packet headers obtained from adaptors may need to be bit-swapped\
    \ to\n   put them into canonical form. Likewise, addresses in canonical form\n\
    \   that are handed to adaptors (e.g., to set an address, to specify a\n   destination\
    \ address in a link-layer header, etc.) may need to be\n   bit-swapped in order\
    \ for the adaptor to process the request as\n   expected.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Neighbor Discovery in IPv6
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Neighbor Discovery in IPv6\n   All of the IPv6 over specific link layers\
    \ documents specify that\n   link-layer addresses must be transmitted in canonical\
    \ order [IPv6-\n   ETHER, IPv6-FDDI, IPv6-TOKEN].  As far as the authors can tell,\
    \ all\n   Ethernet LAN adaptors use canonical order and no special processing\n\
    \   by implementations is needed. In contrast, some FDDI and all Token\n   Ring\
    \ adaptors appear to use non-canonical format.  Implementors must\n   insure that\
    \ any addresses that appear in link-layer address options\n   of Neighbor Discovery\
    \ [DISCOVERY] messages are sent in canonical\n   order and that any link-layer\
    \ addresses extracted from ND packets are\n   interpreted correctly on the local\
    \ machine and its adaptors.\n"
- title: 3.2.  IPv4 and ARP
  contents:
  - "3.2.  IPv4 and ARP\n   Ethernet addresses that appear in ARP packets are in canonical\
    \ order.\n   In contrast, when running ARP over Token Ring, the de facto practice\n\
    \   is to transmit addresses in non-canonical order. Because all Token\n   Ring\
    \ adaptors assume non-canonical ordering, no interoperability\n   problems result\
    \ between communicating nodes attached to the same\n   Token Ring.\n   In some\
    \ environments, however, Token Rings and Ethernets are\n   connected via a bridge.\
    \ When a node on the Token Ring attempts to\n   communicate with a node on the\
    \ Ethernet, communication would normally\n   fail, since the Ethernet will misinterpret\
    \ the Token Ring address\n   (and vice versa). To get around this problem, bridges\
    \ that forward\n   packets between dissimilar network types perform bit swaps\
    \ of the\n   addresses in the address fields of ARP packets that are forwarded\n\
    \   from a network of one type to one of the other.\n"
