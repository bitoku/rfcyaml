    \ with the long axis vertical.\n   B.  DEC 340\n      We have a DEC 340 Display\
    \ Station with a light pen.  Associ-\n      ated with the station are a Rand Tablet\
    \ and a Lincoln Wand.\n      There is a display processor which drives the DEC\

    \      software to utilize the PDS-1's as alphameric and limited\n      graphics\
    \ consoles (at 1200 baud).\n      These are used only with the SEX timesharing\
    \ system.\n   B.  DEC 340\n      We have over several years developed a package\
    \ of Library\n      routines* which interface to FORTRAN programs for use with\n\
    \      the DEC 340 and its associated devices.  This station is\n      used only\
    \ with a stand alone system (RAD 75).\n      Several programs have been implemented\

    \                                                8 June 71\n         1. MOSAIC\n\
    \            MOSAIC is an experimental computer graphics program\n           \
    \ which permits a user to manipulate the parameters of\n            a fairly complex\
    \ polar co-ordinate equation. The ob-\n            ject is to explore the space\
    \ of interesting images\n            which can be produced.  Library facilities\
    \ are provid-\n            ed so that the user can save interesting images.  He\n\
    \            can also combine the images in many ways to form mo-\n          \
    \  saic-like patterns.  An Arriflex 16mm camera can be\n            driven through\
    \ the use of this program, and we have\n            used the system to generate\
    \ several films which serv-\n            ed as a basis for video-graphics experiments\
    \ (TV video-\n            tape).\n         2. FISHEYE\n            Using the interactive\
    \ part of MOSAIC, and a peculiar,\n            exponential mapping function, studies\
    \ were made in the\n            presentation of CRT images too large to fit in\
    \ normal\n            form on our 10\" scope.  The images are mapped in such\n\
    \            a way that part of the image is shown at linear scale,\n        \
    \    the remainder being squeezed up at the outer edges of\n            the screen.\
    \  Thus, the global image is always visible,\n            but details are apparent\
    \ mainly in the linear region.\n            This study formed the basis of an\
    \ M.S. thesis.\n         3. MOVIE\n            This is a movie script language\
    \ which allows the user\n            to compose a scenario describing the entrance\
    \ and exit\n            of images on the CRT.  Mosaics can be created.  Images\n\
    \            can fade-in, fade-out, dissolve, expand, zoom, contract,\n      \
    \      Dramatis personae (in the form of MOSAIC images) can\n            be defined\
    \ and their movements described.  The program\n            computes the movements\
    \ of all images for the duration\n            of the film and then calls on the\
    \ MOSAIC generating\n            routines to make the film.  Camera control is\
    \ automa-\n            tic.\n"
