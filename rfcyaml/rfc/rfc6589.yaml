  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes considerations for the transition\
    \ of end-user\n   content on the Internet to IPv6.  While this is tailored to\
    \ address\n   end-user content, which is typically web-based, many aspects of\
    \ this\n   document may be more broadly applicable to the transition to IPv6 of\n\
    \   other applications and services.  The issues explored herein will be\n   of\
    \ particular interest to major web content sites (sometimes\n   described hereinafter\
    \ as \"high-service-level domains\"), which have\n   specific and unique concerns\
    \ related to maintaining a high-quality\n   user experience for all of their users\
    \ during their transition to\n   IPv6.  This document explores the challenges\
    \ involved in the\n   transition to IPv6, potential migration tactics, possible\
    \ migration\n   phases, and other considerations.  Some sections of this document\n\
    \   also include information about the potential implications of various\n   migration\
    \ tactics or phased approaches to the transition to IPv6.\n"
- title: 2.  Challenges When Transitioning Content to IPv6
  contents:
  - "2.  Challenges When Transitioning Content to IPv6\n   The goal in transitioning\
    \ content to IPv6 is to make that content\n   natively dual-stack enabled, which\
    \ provides native access to all end\n   users via both IPv4 and IPv6.  However,\
    \ there are technical and\n   operational challenges in being able to transition\
    \ smoothly for all\n   end users, which has led to the development of a variety\
    \ of migration\n   tactics.  A first step in understanding various migration tactics\
    \ is\n   to first outline the challenges involved in moving content to IPv6.\n\
    \   Implementers of these various migration tactics are attempting to\n   protect\
    \ users of their services from having a negative experience\n   (poor performance)\
    \ when they receive DNS responses containing AAAA\n   resource records or when\
    \ attempting to use IPv6 transport.  There are\n   two main concerns that pertain\
    \ to this practice: one is IPv6-related\n   impairment, and the other is the maturity\
    \ or stability of IPv6\n   transport (and associated network operations) for high-service-level\n\
    \   domains.  Both can negatively affect the experience of end users.\n   Not\
    \ all domains may face the same challenges in transitioning content\n   to IPv6,\
    \ since the user base of each domain, traffic sources, traffic\n   volumes, and\
    \ other factors obviously will vary between domains.  As a\n   result, while some\
    \ domains have used an IPv6 migration tactic, others\n   have run brief IPv6 experiments\
    \ and then decided to simply turn on\n   IPv6 for the domain without further delay\
    \ and without using any\n   specialized IPv6 migration tactics [Heise].  Each\
    \ domain should\n   therefore consider its specific situation when formulating\
    \ a plan to\n   move to IPv6; there is not one approach that will work for every\n\
    \   domain.\n"
- title: 2.1.  IPv6-Related Impairment
  contents:
  - "2.1.  IPv6-Related Impairment\n   Some implementers have observed that when they\
    \ added AAAA resource\n   records to their authoritative DNS servers in order\
    \ to support IPv6\n   access to their content, a small fraction of end users had\
    \ slow or\n   otherwise impaired access to a given website with both AAAA and\
    \ A\n   resource records.  The fraction of users with such impaired access\n \
    \  has been estimated to be as high as 0.078% of total Internet users\n   [IETF-77-DNSOP]\
    \ [NW-Article-DNSOP] [IPv6-Growth] [IPv6-Brokenness].\n   While it is outside\
    \ the scope of this document to explore the various\n   reasons why a particular\
    \ user's system (host) may have impaired IPv6\n   access, and the potential solutions\
    \ [RFC6555] [RFC6343], for the\n   users who experience this impairment, it has\
    \ a very real performance\n   impact.  It would impact access to all or most dual-stack\
    \ services to\n   which the user attempts to connect.  This negative end-user\n\
    \   experience can range from access that is somewhat slower than usual\n   (as\
    \ compared to native IPv4-based access), to extremely slow access,\n   to no access\
    \ to the domain's resources whatsoever.  In essence,\n   whether the end user\
    \ even has an IPv6 address or not, merely by\n   receiving a AAAA record response,\
    \ the user either cannot access a\n   Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN, representing\
    \ a service or resource\n   sought) or it is so slow that the user gives up and\
    \ assumes the\n   destination is unreachable.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Operational Maturity Concerns
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Operational Maturity Concerns\n   Some implementers have discovered that\
    \ network operations, operations\n   support and business support systems, and\
    \ other operational processes\n   and procedures are less mature for IPv6 as compared\
    \ to IPv4, since\n   IPv6 has not heretofore been pervasively deployed.  This\
    \ operational\n   immaturity may be observed not just within the network of a\
    \ given\n   domain but also in any directly or indirectly interconnected\n   networks.\
    \  As a result, many domains consider it prudent to undertake\n   any network\
    \ changes that will cause traffic to shift to IPv6\n   gradually, in order to\
    \ provide time and experience for IPv6\n   operations and network practices to\
    \ mature.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Volume-Based Concerns
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Volume-Based Concerns\n   While Section 2.2 pertains to risks due to immaturity\
    \ in operations,\n   a related concern is that some technical issues may not become\n\
    \   apparent until some moderate to high volume of traffic is sent via\n   IPv6\
    \ to and from a domain.  As above, this may be the case not just\n   within the\
    \ network of that domain but also for any directly or\n   indirectly interconnected\
    \ networks.  Furthermore, compared to domains\n   with small to moderate traffic\
    \ volumes, whether by the count of end\n   users or count of bytes transferred,\
    \ high-traffic domains receive\n   such a level of usage that it is prudent to\
    \ undertake any network\n   changes gradually and in a manner that minimizes the\
    \ risk of\n   disruption.  One can imagine that for one of the top ten sites\n\
    \   globally, for example, the idea of suddenly turning on a significant\n   amount\
    \ of IPv6 traffic is quite daunting and would carry a relatively\n   high risk\
    \ of network and/or other disruptions.\n"
- title: 3.  IPv6 Adoption Implications
  contents:
  - "3.  IPv6 Adoption Implications\n   It is important that the challenges in transitioning\
    \ content to IPv6\n   as noted in Section 2 are addressed, especially for high-service-\n\
    \   level domains.  Some high-service-level domains may find the prospect\n  \
    \ of transitioning to IPv6 extremely daunting without having some\n   ability\
    \ to address these challenges and to incrementally control\n   their transition\
    \ to IPv6.  Lacking such controls, some domains may\n   choose to substantially\
    \ delay their transition to IPv6.  A\n   substantial delay in moving content to\
    \ IPv6 could certainly mean\n   there are somewhat fewer motivating factors for\
    \ network operators to\n   deploy IPv6 to end-user hosts (though they have many\
    \ significant\n   motivating factors that are largely independent of content).\
    \  At the\n   same time, unless network operators transition to IPv6, there are\
    \ of\n   course fewer motivations for domain owners to transition content to\n\
    \   IPv6.  Without progress in each part of the Internet ecosystem,\n   networks\
    \ and/or content sites may delay, postpone, or cease adoption\n   of IPv6, or\
    \ to actively seek alternatives to it.  Such alternatives\n   may include the\
    \ use of multi-layer or large-scale network address\n   translation (NAT), which\
    \ is not preferred relative to native dual\n   stack.\n   Obviously, transitioning\
    \ content to IPv6 is important to IPv6\n   adoption overall.  While challenges\
    \ do exist, such a transition is\n   not an impossible task for a domain to undertake.\
    \  A range of\n   potential migration tactics, as noted below in Section 4, can\
    \ help\n   meet these challenges and enable a domain to successfully transition\n\
    \   content and other services to IPv6.\n"
- title: 4.  Potential Migration Tactics
  contents:
  - "4.  Potential Migration Tactics\n   Domains have a wide range of potential tactics\
    \ at their disposal that\n   may be used to facilitate the migration to IPv6.\
    \  This section\n   includes many of the key tactics that could be used by a domain\
    \ but\n   by no means provides an exhaustive or exclusive list.  Only a\n   specific\
    \ domain can judge whether or not a given (or any) migration\n   tactic applies\
    \ to it and meets its needs.  A domain may also decide\n   to pursue several of\
    \ these tactics in parallel.  Thus, the usefulness\n   of each tactic and the\
    \ associated pros and cons will vary from domain\n   to domain.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Solving Current End-User IPv6 Impairments
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Solving Current End-User IPv6 Impairments\n   Domains can endeavor to fix\
    \ the underlying technical problems\n   experienced by their end users during\
    \ the transition to IPv6, as\n   noted in Section 2.1.  One challenge with this\
    \ option is that a\n   domain may have little or no control over the network connectivity,\n\
    \   operating system, client software (such as a web browser), and/or\n   other\
    \ capabilities of the end users of that domain.  In most cases, a\n   domain is\
    \ only in a position to influence and guide its end users.\n   While this is not\
    \ the same sort of direct control that may exist, for\n   example, in an enterprise\
    \ network, major domains are likely to be\n   trusted by their end users and may\
    \ therefore be able to influence and\n   guide these users in solving any IPv6-related\
    \ impairments.\n   Another challenge is that end-user impairments are something\
    \ that one\n   domain on its own cannot solve.  This means that domains may find\
    \ it\n   more effective to coordinate with many others in the Internet\n   community\
    \ to solve what is really a collective problem that affects\n   the entire Internet.\
    \  Of course, it can sometimes be difficult to\n   motivate members of the Internet\
    \ community to work collectively\n   towards such a goal, sharing the labor, time,\
    \ and costs related to\n   such an effort.  However, World IPv6 Day [W6D] shows\
    \ that such\n   community efforts are possible, and despite any potential challenges,\n\
    \   the Internet community continues to work together in order to solve\n   end-user\
    \ IPv6 impairments.\n   One potential tactic may be to identify which users have\
    \ such\n   impairments and then to communicate this information to affected\n\
    \   users.  Such end-user communication is likely to be most helpful if\n   the\
    \ end users are not only alerted to a potential problem but are\n   given careful\
    \ and detailed advice on how to resolve this on their\n   own, or are guided to\
    \ where they can seek help in doing so.  Another\n   potential tactic is for a\
    \ domain to collect, track over time, and\n   periodically share with the Internet\
    \ community the rate of impairment\n   observed for that domain.  In any such\
    \ end-user IPv6-related analysis\n   and communication, Section 6.2 is worth taking\
    \ into account.\n   However, while these tactics can help reduce IPv6-related\
    \ impairments\n   (Section 2.1), they do not address either operational maturity\n\
    \   concerns (noted in Section 2.2) or volume-based concerns (noted in\n   Section\
    \ 2.3), which should be considered and addressed separately.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Using IPv6-Specific Names
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Using IPv6-Specific Names\n   Another potential migration tactic is for\
    \ a domain to gain experience\n   using a special FQDN.  This has become typical\
    \ for domains beginning\n   the transition to IPv6, whereby an address-family-specific\
    \ name such\n   as ipv6.example.com or www.ipv6.example.com is used.  An end user\n\
    \   would have to know to use this special IPv6-specific name; it is not\n   the\
    \ same name used for regular traffic.\n   This special IPv6-specific name directs\
    \ traffic to a host or hosts\n   that have been enabled for native IPv6 access.\
    \  In some cases, this\n   name may point to hosts that are separate from those\
    \ used for IPv4\n   traffic (via www.example.com), while in other cases it may\
    \ point to\n   the same hosts used for IPv4 traffic.  A subsequent phase, if\n\
    \   separate hosts are used to support special IPv6-specific names, is to\n  \
    \ move to the same hosts used for regular traffic in order to utilize\n   and\
    \ exercise production infrastructure more fully.  Regardless of\n   whether or\
    \ not dedicated hosts are used, the use of the special name\n   is a way to incrementally\
    \ control traffic as a tool for a domain to\n   gain IPv6 experience and increase\
    \ IPv6 use on a relatively controlled\n   basis.  Any lessons learned can then\
    \ inform plans for a full\n   transition to IPv6.  This also provides an opportunity\
    \ for a domain\n   to develop any necessary training for staff, to develop IPv6-related\n\
    \   testing procedures for its production network and lab, to deploy IPv6\n  \
    \ functionality into its production network, and to develop and deploy\n   IPv6-related\
    \ network and service monitors.  It is also an opportunity\n   to add a relatively\
    \ small amount of IPv6 traffic to ensure that\n   network gear, network interconnects,\
    \ and IPv6 routing in general are\n   working as expected.\n   While using a special\
    \ IPv6-specific name is a good initial step to\n   functionally test and prepare\
    \ a domain for IPv6 -- including\n   developing and maturing IPv6 operations,\
    \ as noted in Section 2.2 --\n   the utility of the tactic is limited, since users\
    \ must know the IPv6-\n   specific name, the traffic volume will be low, and the\
    \ traffic is\n   unlikely to be representative of the general population of end\
    \ users\n   (they are likely to be self-selecting early adopters and more\n  \
    \ technically advanced than average), among other reasons.  As a\n   result, any\
    \ concerns and risks related to traffic volume, as noted in\n   Section 2.3, should\
    \ still be considered and addressed separately.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Implementing DNS Resolver Whitelisting
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Implementing DNS Resolver Whitelisting\n   Another potential tactic --\
    \ especially when a high-service-level\n   domain is ready to move beyond an IPv6-specific\
    \ name, as described in\n   Section 4.2 -- is to selectively return AAAA resource\
    \ records (RRs),\n   which contain IPv6 addresses.  This selective response of\
    \ DNS records\n   is performed by an authoritative DNS server for a domain in\
    \ response\n   to DNS queries sent by DNS recursive resolvers [RFC1035].  This\
    \ is\n   commonly referred to in the Internet community as \"DNS Resolver\n  \
    \ Whitelisting\", and will be referred to as such hereafter, though in\n   essence\
    \ it is simply a tactic enabling the selective return of DNS\n   records based\
    \ upon various technical factors.  An end user is seeking\n   a resource by name,\
    \ and this selective response mechanism enables\n   what is perceived to be the\
    \ most reliable and best performing IP\n   address family to be used (IPv4 or\
    \ IPv6).  It shares similarities\n   with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), Global\
    \ Server Load Balancing\n   (GSLB), DNS Load Balancing, and Split DNS, as described\
    \ below in\n   Sections 4.3.2, 4.3.3, and 4.3.4.  A few high-service-level domains\n\
    \   have either implemented DNS Resolver Whitelisting (one of many\n   migration\
    \ tactics they have used or are using) or are considering\n   doing so [NW-Article-DNS-WL]\
    \ [WL-Ops].\n   This is a migration tactic used by domains as a method for\n \
    \  incrementally transitioning inbound traffic to a domain to IPv6.  If\n   an\
    \ incremental tactic like this is not used, a domain might return\n   AAAA resource\
    \ records to any relevant DNS query, meaning the domain\n   could go quickly from\
    \ no IPv6 traffic to a potentially significant\n   amount as soon as the AAAA\
    \ resource records are published.  When DNS\n   Resolver Whitelisting is implemented,\
    \ a domain's authoritative DNS\n   will selectively return a AAAA resource record\
    \ to DNS recursive\n   resolvers on a whitelist maintained by the domain, while\
    \ returning no\n   AAAA resource records to DNS recursive resolvers that are not\
    \ on that\n   whitelist.  This tactic will not have a direct impact on reducing\n\
    \   IPv6-related impairments (Section 2.1), though it can help a domain\n   address\
    \ operational maturity concerns (Section 2.2) as well as\n   concerns and risks\
    \ related to traffic volume (Section 2.3).  While\n   DNS Resolver Whitelisting\
    \ does not solve IPv6-related impairments, it\n   can help a domain to avoid users\
    \ that have them.  As a result, the\n   tactic removes their impact in all but\
    \ the few networks that are\n   whitelisted.  DNS Resolver Whitelisting also allows\
    \ website operators\n   to protect non-IPv6 networks (i.e., networks that do not\
    \ support IPv6\n   and/or do not have plans to do so in the future) from IPv6-related\n\
    \   impairments in their networks.  Finally, domains using this tactic\n   should\
    \ understand that the onus is on them to ensure that the servers\n   being whitelisted\
    \ represent a network that has proven to their\n   satisfaction that they are\
    \ IPv6-ready and that this will not create a\n   poor end-user experience for\
    \ users of the whitelisted server.\n   There are of course challenges and concerns\
    \ related to DNS Resolver\n   Whitelisting.  Some of the concerns with a whitelist\
    \ of DNS recursive\n   resolvers may be held by parties other than the implementing\
    \ domain,\n   such as network operators or end users that may not have had their\n\
    \   DNS recursive resolvers added to a whitelist.  Additionally, the IP\n   address\
    \ of a DNS recursive resolver is not a precise indicator of the\n   IPv6 preparedness,\
    \ or lack of IPv6-related impairment, of end-user\n   hosts that query (use) a\
    \ particular DNS recursive resolver.  While\n   the IP addresses of DNS recursive\
    \ resolvers on networks known to have\n   deployed IPv6 may be an imperfect proxy\
    \ for judging IPv6\n   preparedness, or lack of IPv6-related impairment, this\
    \ method is one\n   of the better available methods at the current time.  For\
    \ example,\n   implementers have found that it is possible to measure the level\
    \ of\n   IPv6 preparedness of the end users behind any given DNS recursive\n \
    \  resolver by conducting ongoing measurement of the IPv6 preparedness\n   of\
    \ end users querying for one-time-use hostnames and then correlating\n   the domain's\
    \ authoritative DNS server logs with their web server\n   logs.  This can help\
    \ implementers form a good picture of which DNS\n   recursive resolvers have working\
    \ IPv6 users behind them and which do\n   not, what the latency impact of turning\
    \ on IPv6 for any given DNS\n   recursive resolver is, etc.  In addition, given\
    \ the current state of\n   global IPv6 deployment, this migration tactic allows\
    \ content\n   providers to selectively expose the availability of their IPv6\n\
    \   services.  While opinions in the Internet community concerning DNS\n   Resolver\
    \ Whitelisting are understandably quite varied, there is clear\n   consensus that\
    \ DNS Resolver Whitelisting can be a useful tactic for\n   use during the transition\
    \ of a domain to IPv6.  In particular, some\n   high-service-level domains view\
    \ DNS Resolver Whitelisting as one of\n   the few practical and low-risk approaches\
    \ enabling them to transition\n   to IPv6, without which their transition may\
    \ not take place for some\n   time.  However, there is also consensus that this\
    \ practice is\n   workable on a manual basis (see below) only in the short term\
    \ and\n   that it will not scale over the long term.  Thus, some domains may\n\
    \   find DNS Resolver Whitelisting a beneficial temporary tactic in their\n  \
    \ transition to IPv6.\n   At the current time, generally speaking, a domain that\
    \ implements DNS\n   Resolver Whitelisting does so manually.  This means that\
    \ a domain\n   manually maintains a list of networks that are permitted to receive\n\
    \   IPv6 records (via their DNS resolver IP addresses) and that these\n   networks\
    \ typically submit applications, or follow some other process\n   established\
    \ by the domain, in order to be added to the DNS Whitelist.\n   However, implementers\
    \ foresee that a subsequent phase of DNS Resolver\n   Whitelisting is likely to\
    \ emerge in the future, possibly in the near\n   future.  In this new phase, a\
    \ domain would return IPv6 and/or IPv4\n   records dynamically based on automatically\
    \ detected technical\n   capabilities, location, or other factors.  It would then\
    \ function\n   much like (or indeed as part of) GSLB, a common practice already\
    \ in\n   use today, as described in Section 4.3.2.  Furthermore, in this\n   future\
    \ phase, networks would be added to and removed from a DNS\n   Whitelist automatically,\
    \ and possibly on a near-real-time basis.\n   This means, crucially, that networks\
    \ would no longer need to apply to\n   be added to a whitelist, which may alleviate\
    \ many of the key concerns\n   that network operators may have with this tactic\
    \ when it is\n   implemented on a manual basis.\n"

  - "4.3.1.  How DNS Resolver Whitelisting Works\n   Using a \"whitelist\" in a generic\
    \ sense means that no traffic (or\n   traffic of a certain type) is permitted\
    \ to the destination host\n   unless the originating host's IP address is contained\
    \ in the\n   whitelist.  In contrast, using a \"blacklist\" means that all traffic\n\
    \   is permitted to the destination host unless the originating host's IP\n  \
    \ address is contained in the blacklist.  In the case of DNS Resolver\n   Whitelisting,\
    \ the resource that an end user seeks is a name, not an\n   IP address or IP address\
    \ family.  Thus, an end user is seeking a name\n   such as www.example.com, without\
    \ regard to the underlying IP address\n   family (IPv4 or IPv6) that may be used\
    \ to access that resource.\n   DNS Resolver Whitelisting is implemented in authoritative\
    \ DNS\n   servers, not in DNS recursive resolvers.  These authoritative DNS\n\
    \   servers selectively return AAAA resource records using the IP address\n  \
    \ of the DNS recursive resolver that has sent them a query.  Thus, for\n   a given\
    \ operator of a website, such as www.example.com, the domain\n   operator implements\
    \ whitelisting on the authoritative DNS servers for\n   the domain example.com.\
    \  The whitelist is populated with the IPv4\n   and/or IPv6 addresses or prefix\
    \ ranges of DNS recursive resolvers on\n   the Internet, which have been authorized\
    \ to receive AAAA resource\n   record responses.  These DNS recursive resolvers\
    \ are operated by\n   third parties, such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs),\n\
    \   universities, governments, businesses, and individual end users.  If\n   a\
    \ DNS recursive resolver is not matched in the whitelist, then AAAA\n   resource\
    \ records WILL NOT be sent in response to a query for a\n   hostname in the example.com\
    \ domain (and an A record would be sent).\n   However, if a DNS recursive resolver\
    \ is matched in the whitelist,\n   then AAAA resource records WILL be sent.  As\
    \ a result, while\n   Section 2.2 of [RFC4213] notes that a stub resolver can\
    \ make a choice\n   between whether to use a AAAA record or A record response,\
    \ with DNS\n   Resolver Whitelisting the authoritative DNS server can also decide\n\
    \   whether to return a AAAA record, an A record, or both record types.\n   When\
    \ implemented on a manual basis, DNS Resolver Whitelisting\n   generally means\
    \ that a very small fraction of the DNS recursive\n   resolvers on the Internet\
    \ (those in the whitelist) will receive AAAA\n   responses.  The large majority\
    \ of DNS recursive resolvers on the\n   Internet will therefore receive only A\
    \ resource records containing\n   IPv4 addresses.  Domains may find the practice\
    \ imposes some\n   incremental operational burdens insofar as it can consume staff\
    \ time\n   to maintain a whitelist (such as additions and deletions to the\n \
    \  list), respond to and review applications to be added to a whitelist,\n   maintain\
    \ good performance levels on authoritative DNS servers as the\n   whitelist grows,\
    \ create new network monitors to check the health of a\n   whitelist function,\
    \ perform new types of troubleshooting related to\n   whitelisting, etc.  In addition,\
    \ manually based whitelisting imposes\n   some incremental burdens on operators\
    \ of DNS recursive resolvers\n   (such as network operators), since they will\
    \ need to apply to be\n   whitelisted with any implementing domains, and will\
    \ subsequently need\n   processes and systems to track the status of whitelisting\n\
    \   applications, respond to requests for additional information\n   pertaining\
    \ to these applications, and track any de-whitelisting\n   actions.\n   When implemented\
    \ on an automated basis in the future, DNS recursive\n   resolvers listed in the\
    \ whitelist could expand and contract\n   dynamically, and possibly in near-real\
    \ time, based on a wide range of\n   factors.  As a result, it is likely that\
    \ the number of DNS recursive\n   resolvers on the whitelist will be substantially\
    \ larger than when\n   such a list is maintained manually, and it is also likely\
    \ that the\n   whitelist will grow at a rapid rate.  This automation can eliminate\n\
    \   most of the significant incremental operational burdens on\n   implementing\
    \ domains as well as operators of DNS recursive resolvers,\n   which is clearly\
    \ a factor that is motivating implementers to work to\n   automate this function.\n\
    \   Section 4.3.1.1 and Figure 1 provide more details on DNS Resolver\n   Whitelisting\
    \ in general.  In addition, the potential deployment\n   models of DNS Resolver\
    \ Whitelisting (manual and automated) are\n   described in Section 5.  It is also\
    \ important to note that DNS\n   Resolver Whitelisting also works independently\
    \ of whether an\n   authoritative DNS server, DNS recursive resolver, or end-user\
    \ host\n   uses IPv4 transport, IPv6, or both.  So, for example, whitelisting\n\
    \   may not result in the return of AAAA responses even in those cases\n   where\
    \ the DNS recursive resolver has queried the authoritative server\n   over an\
    \ IPv6 transport.  This may also be the case in some situations\n   when the end-user\
    \ host's original query to its DNS recursive resolver\n   was over IPv6 transport,\
    \ if that DNS recursive resolver is not on a\n   given whitelist.  One important\
    \ reason for this is that even though\n   the DNS recursive resolver may have\
    \ no IPv6-related impairments, this\n   is not a reliable predictor of whether\
    \ the same is true of the end-\n   user host.  This also means that a DNS Whitelist\
    \ can contain both\n   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n"

  - "4.3.1.1.  Description of the Operation of DNS Resolver Whitelisting\n   Specific\
    \ implementations will vary from domain to domain, based on a\n   range of factors\
    \ such as the technical capabilities of a given\n   domain.  As such, any examples\
    \ listed herein should be considered\n   general examples and are not intended\
    \ to be exhaustive.\n   The system logic of DNS Resolver Whitelisting is as follows:\n\
    \   1.  The authoritative DNS server for example.com receives DNS queries\n  \
    \     for the A (IPv4) and/or AAAA (IPv6) address resource records for\n     \
    \  the FQDN www.example.com, for which AAAA (IPv6) resource records\n       exist.\n\
    \   2.  The authoritative DNS server checks the IP address (IPv4, IPv6,\n    \
    \   or both) of the DNS recursive resolver sending the AAAA (IPv6)\n       query\
    \ against the whitelist (i.e., the DNS Whitelist).\n   3.  If the DNS recursive\
    \ resolver's IP address IS matched in the\n       whitelist, then the response\
    \ to that specific DNS recursive\n       resolver can contain AAAA (IPv6) address\
    \ resource records.\n   4.  If the DNS recursive resolver's IP address IS NOT\
    \ matched in the\n       whitelist, then the response to that specific DNS recursive\n\
    \       resolver cannot contain AAAA (IPv6) address resource records.  In\n  \
    \     this case, the server will likely return a response with the\n       response\
    \ code (RCODE) being set to 0 (No Error) with an empty\n       answer section\

  - "4.3.2.  Similarities to Content Delivery Networks and Global Server Load\n  \
    \      Balancing\n   DNS Resolver Whitelisting is functionally similar to CDNs\
    \ and GSLB.\n   When using a CDN or GSLB, a geographically aware authoritative\
    \ DNS\n   server function is usually part of that overall system.  As a result,\n\
    \   the use of a CDN or GSLB with an authoritative DNS server function\n   enables\
    \ the IP address resource records returned to a resolver in\n   response to a\
    \ query to vary, based on the estimated geographic\n   location of the resolver\
    \ [Wild-Resolvers] or a range of other\n   technical factors.  This CDN or GSLB\

- title: 4.3.3.  Similarities to DNS Load Balancing
  contents:
  - "4.3.3.  Similarities to DNS Load Balancing\n   DNS Resolver Whitelisting has\
    \ some similarities to DNS Load\n   Balancing.  There are of course many ways\
    \ that DNS Load Balancing can\n   be performed.  In one example, multiple IP address\
    \ resource records\n   (A and/or AAAA) can be added to the DNS for a given FQDN.\
    \  This\n   approach is referred to as DNS round robin [RFC1794].  DNS round\n\
    \   robin may also be employed where SRV resource records are used\n   [RFC2782].\
    \  In another example, one or more of the IP address\n   resource records in the\
    \ DNS will direct traffic to a load balancer.\n   That load balancer, in turn,\
    \ may be application-aware, and pass the\n   traffic on to one or more hosts that\
    \ are connected to the load\n   balancer and that have different IP addresses.\
    \  In cases where\n   private IPv4 addresses are used [RFC1918], as well as when\
    \ public IP\n   addresses are used, those end hosts may not necessarily be directly\n\
    \   reachable without passing through the load balancer first.  So,\n   similar\

    \ an end-user's host communicates with when using\n   an FQDN.\n"
- title: 4.3.4.  Similarities to Split DNS
  contents:
  - "4.3.4.  Similarities to Split DNS\n   DNS Resolver Whitelisting has some similarities\
    \ to so-called Split\n   DNS, briefly described in Section 3.8 of [RFC2775]. \
    \ When Split DNS\n   is used, the authoritative DNS server selectively returns\
    \ different\n   responses, depending upon what host has sent the query.  While\n\
    \   [RFC2775] notes that the typical use of Split DNS is to provide one\n   answer\
    \ to hosts on an Intranet (internal network) and a different\n   answer to hosts\
    \ on the Internet (external or public network), the\n   basic idea is that different\
    \ answers are provided to hosts on\n   different networks.  This is similar to\
    \ the way that DNS Resolver\n   Whitelisting works, whereby hosts on different\
    \ networks that use\n   different DNS recursive resolvers receive different answers\
    \ if one\n   DNS recursive resolver is on the whitelist and the other is not.\n\
    \   However, Internet transparency and Internet fragmentation concerns\n   regarding\
    \ Split DNS are detailed in Section 2.1 of [RFC2956].\n   Section 2.7 of [RFC2956]\
    \ notes concerns regarding Split DNS,\n   including the concern that the deployment\
    \ of Split DNS \"makes the use\n   of Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) as\
    \ endpoint identifiers more\n   complex\".  Section 3.5 of [RFC2956] further recommends\
    \ that\n   maintaining a stable approach to DNS operations is key during\n   transitions,\
    \ such as the one to IPv6 that is underway now, and states\n   that \"Operational\
    \ stability of DNS is paramount, especially during a\n   transition of the network\
    \ layer, and both IPv6 and some network\n   address translation techniques place\
    \ a heavier burden on DNS\".\n"
- title: 4.3.5.  Related Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.3.5.  Related Considerations\n   While techniques such as GSLB and DNS Load\
    \ Balancing -- which share\n   much in common with DNS Resolver Whitelisting --\
    \ are widespread, some\n   in the community have raised a range of concerns about\
    \ all of these\n   practices.  Some concerns are specific to DNS Resolver Whitelisting\n\
    \   [WL-Concerns].  Other concerns are not as specific and pertain to the\n  \
    \ general practice of implementing content location or other network\n   policy\
    \ controls in the \"middle\" of the network, in a so-called\n   \"middlebox\"\
    \ function.  Whether such DNS-related functions are really\n   part of a middlebox\
    \ is debatable.  Nevertheless, implementers should\n   at least be aware of some\
    \ of the risks of middleboxes, as noted in\n   [RFC3724].  A related document,\
    \ [RFC1958], explains that configured\n   state, policies, and other functions\
    \ needed in the middle of the\n   network should be minimized as a design goal.\
    \  In addition,\n   Section 2.16 of [RFC3234] makes specific statements concerning\n\
    \   modified DNS servers.  Section 1.2 of [RFC3234] also outlines more\n   general\
    \ concerns about the introduction of new failure modes when\n   configuration\
    \ is no longer limited to two ends of a session, so that\n   diagnosis of failures\
    \ and misconfigurations could become more\n   complex.  Two additional sources\
    \ worth considering are [Tussle] and\n   [Rethinking], in which the authors note\
    \ concerns regarding the\n   introduction of new control points (e.g., in middleboxes\
    \ or in\n   the DNS).\n   However, state, policies, and other functions have always\
    \ been\n   necessary to enable effective, reliable, and high-quality end-to-end\n\
    \   communications on the Internet.  In addition, the use of GSLB, CDNs,\n   DNS\
    \ Load Balancing, and Split DNS are not only widely deployed but\n   are almost\
    \ uniformly viewed as essential to the functioning of the\n   Internet and highly\
    \ beneficial to the quality of the end-user\n   experience on the Internet.  These\
    \ techniques have had, and continue\n   to have, a beneficial effect on the experience\
    \ of a wide range of\n   Internet applications and protocols.  So, while there\
    \ are valid\n   concerns about implementing policy controls in the \"middle\"\
    \ of the\n   network, or anywhere away from edge hosts, the definition of what\n\
    \   constitutes the middle and edge of the network is debatable in this\n   case.\
    \  This is particularly so given that GSLBs and CDNs facilitate\n   connections\
    \ from end hosts and the optimal content hosts, and could\n   therefore be considered\
    \ a modest and, in many cases, essential\n   network policy extension of a network's\
    \ edge, especially in the case\n   of high-service-level domains.\n   There may\
    \ be additional implications for end users that have\n   configured their hosts\
    \ to use a third party as their DNS recursive\n   resolver, rather than the one(s)\
    \ provided by their network operator.\n   In such cases, it will be more challenging\
    \ for a domain using\n   whitelisting to determine the level of IPv6-related impairment\
    \ when\n   such third-party DNS recursive resolvers are used, given the wide\n\
    \   variety of end-user access networks that may be used and given that\n   this\
    \ mix may change in unpredictable ways over time.\n"

    \ resolvers can receive\n   AAAA resource records only if they are on the whitelist.\
    \  DNS\n   Blacklisting is by contrast the opposite of that, whereby all DNS\n\

    \ is simply because the domain would presumably be focused\n   on a smaller number\
    \ of DNS recursive resolvers with well-known\n   IPv6-related problems.\n   It\
    \ is also worth noting that the email industry has a long experience\n   with\
    \ blacklists and, very generally speaking, blacklists tend to be\n   effective\
    \ and well received when it is easy to discover if an IP\n   address is on a blacklist,\
    \ if there is a transparent and easily\n   understood process for requesting removal\
    \ from a blacklist, and if\n   the decision-making criteria for placing a server\
    \ on a blacklist are\n   transparently disclosed and perceived as fair.  However,\
    \ in contrast\n   to an email blacklist where a blacklisted host cannot send email\
    \ to a\n   domain at all, with DNS Resolver Whitelisting, communications will\n\
    \   still occur over IPv4 transport.\n"

  - "4.5.  Transitioning Directly to Native Dual Stack\n   As an alternative to adopting\
    \ any of the aforementioned migration\n   tactics, domains can choose to transition\
    \ to native dual stack\n   directly by adding native IPv6 capabilities to their\
    \ network and\n   hosts and by publishing AAAA resource records in the DNS for\
    \ their\n   named resources.  Of course, a domain can still control this\n   transition\
    \ gradually, on a name-by-name basis, by adding native IPv6\n   to one name at\
    \ a time, such as mail.example.com first and\n   www.example.com later.  So, even\
    \ a \"direct\" transition can be\n   performed gradually.\n   It is then up to\
    \ end users with IPv6-related impairments to discover\n   and fix any applicable\
    \ impairments.  However, the concerns and risks\n   related to traffic volume\
    \ (Section 2.3) should still be considered\n   and managed, since those are not\
    \ directly related to such\n   impairments.  Not all content providers (or other\
    \ domains) may face\n   the challenges detailed herein or face them to the same\
    \ degree, since\n   the user base of each domain, traffic sources, traffic volumes,\
    \ and\n   other factors obviously vary between domains.\n   For example, while\
    \ some content providers have implemented DNS\n   Resolver Whitelisting (one migration\
    \ tactic), others have run IPv6\n   experiments whereby they added AAAA resource\
    \ records and observed and\n   measured errors, and then decided not to implement\
    \ DNS Resolver\n   Whitelisting [Heise].  A more widespread example of such an\n\
    \   experiment was World IPv6 Day [W6D], sponsored by the Internet\n   Society,\
    \ on June 8, 2011.  This was a unique opportunity for hundreds\n   of domains\
    \ to add AAAA resource records to the DNS without using DNS\n   Resolver Whitelisting,\
    \ all at the same time.  Some of the\n   participating domains chose to leave\
    \ AAAA resource records in place\n   following the experiment based on their experiences.\n\
    \   Content providers can run their own independent experiments in the\n   future,\
    \ adding AAAA resource records for a brief period of time\n   (minutes, hours,\
    \ or days), and then analyzing any impacts or effects\n   on traffic and the experience\
    \ of end users.  They can also simply\n   turn on IPv6 for their domain, which\
    \ may be easier when the\n   transition does not involve a high-service-level\
    \ domain.\n"

    \ to another.\n   As a result, it is not possible to say that the potential phases\n\
    \   below make sense for every implementer.  This also means that the\n   duration\
    \ of each phase will vary between implementers, and even that\n   different implementers\

  contents:
  - "5.5.  Turning Off DNS Resolver Whitelisting\n   Domains that choose to implement\
    \ DNS Resolver Whitelisting generally\n   consider it to be a temporary measure.\
    \  Many implementers have\n   announced that they plan to permanently turn off\
    \ DNS Resolver\n   Whitelisting beginning on the date of the World IPv6 Launch,\
    \ on\n   June 6, 2012 [World-IPv6-Launch].  For any implementers that do not\n\
    \   turn off DNS Resolver Whitelisting at that time, it may be unclear\n   how\
    \ each and every one will judge the point in time that network\n   conditions\
    \ have changed sufficiently to justify turning off DNS\n   Resolver Whitelisting.\
    \  That being said, it is clear that the extent\n   of IPv6 deployment to end\
    \ users in networks, the state of IPv6-\n   related impairment, and the maturity\
    \ of IPv6 operations are all\n   important factors.  Any such implementers may\
    \ wish to take into\n   consideration that, as a practical matter, it will be\
    \ impossible to\n   get to a point where there are no longer any IPv6-related\n\
    \   impairments; some reasonably small number of hosts will inevitably be\n  \
    \ left behind as end users elect not to upgrade them or because some\n   hosts\
    \ are incapable of being upgraded.\n"

    \ in time\n   when domains wish to make their content widely available over IPv6\n\

- title: 6.1.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Security Considerations\n   If DNS Resolver Whitelisting is adopted, as\
    \ noted in Section 4.3,\n   then organizations that apply DNS Resolver Whitelisting\
    \ policies in\n   their authoritative servers should have procedures and systems\
    \ that\n   do not allow unauthorized parties to modify the whitelist (or\n   blacklist),\
    \ just as all configuration settings for name servers\n   should be protected\
    \ by appropriate procedures and systems.  Such\n   unauthorized additions or removals\
    \ from the whitelist (or blacklist)\n   can be damaging, causing content providers\
    \ and/or network operators\n   to incur support costs resulting from end-user\
    \ and/or customer\n   contacts, as well as causing potential dramatic and disruptive\
    \ swings\n   in traffic from IPv6 to IPv4 or vice versa.\n   DNS Security Extensions\
    \ (DNSSEC) as defined in [RFC4033], [RFC4034],\n   and [RFC4035] use cryptographic\
    \ digital signatures to provide origin\n   authentication and integrity assurance\
    \ for DNS data.  This is done by\n   creating signatures for DNS data on a Security-Aware\
    \ Authoritative\n   Name Server that can be used by Security-Aware Resolvers to\
    \ verify\n   the answers.  Since DNS Resolver Whitelisting is implemented on an\n\
    \   authoritative DNS server, which provides different answers, depending\n  \
    \ upon which DNS resolver has sent a query, the DNSSEC chain of trust\n   is not\
    \ altered.  So, even though an authoritative DNS server will\n   selectively return\
    \ AAAA resource records or a non-existence response,\n   both types of responses\
    \ will be signed and will validate.  In\n   practical terms, this means that two\
    \ separate views or zones are\n   used, each of which is signed, so that whether\
    \ or not particular\n   resource records exist, the existence or non-existence\
    \ of the record\n   can still be validated using DNSSEC.  As a result, there should\
    \ not\n   be any negative impact on DNSSEC for those domains that have\n   implemented\
    \ DNSSEC on their Security-Aware Authoritative Name Servers\n   and also implemented\
    \ DNS Resolver Whitelisting.  As for any party\n   implementing DNSSEC, such domains\
    \ should of course ensure that\n   resource records are being appropriately and\
    \ reliably signed and are\n   consistent with the response being returned.\n \
    \  However, network operators that run DNS recursive resolvers should be\n   careful\
    \ not to modify the responses received from authoritative DNS\n   servers.  It\
    \ is possible that some networks may attempt to do so in\n   order to prevent\
    \ AAAA record responses from going to end-user hosts,\n   due to some IPv6-related\
    \ impairment or other lack of IPv6 readiness\n   within that network.  But when\
    \ a network operates a Security-Aware\n   Resolver, modifying or suppressing AAAA\
    \ resource records for a\n   DNSSEC-signed domain could break the chain of trust\
    \ established with\n   DNSSEC.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Privacy Considerations\n   As noted in Section 4.1, there is a benefit\
    \ in sharing IPv6-related\n   impairment statistics within the Internet community\
    \ over time.  Any\n   statistics that are shared or disclosed publicly should\
    \ be aggregate\n   statistics, such as \"the domain example.com has observed an\
    \ average\n   daily impairment rate of 0.05% in September 2011, down from 0.15%\
    \ in\n   January 2011\".  They should not include information that can directly\n\
    \   or indirectly identify individuals, such as names or email addresses.\n  \
    \ Sharing only aggregate data can help protect end-user privacy and any\n   information\
    \ that may be proprietary to a domain.\n   In addition, there are often methods\
    \ to detect IPv6-related\n   impairments for a specific end user, such as running\
    \ an IPv6 test\n   when an end user visits the website of a particular domain.\
    \  Should a\n   domain then choose to automatically communicate the facts of an\n\
    \   impairment to an affected user, there are likely no direct privacy\n   considerations.\
    \  However, if the domain then decides to share\n   information concerning that\
    \ particular end user with that user's\n   network operator or another third party,\
    \ then the domain may wish to\n   consider advising the end user of this and seeking\
    \ to obtain the end-\n   user's consent to share such information.\n   Appropriate\
    \ guidelines for any information-sharing likely varies by\n   country and/or legal\
    \ jurisdiction.  Domains should consider any\n   potential privacy issues when\
    \ considering what information can be\n   shared.  If a domain does publish or\
    \ share detailed impairment\n   statistics, it would be well advised to avoid\
    \ identifying individual\n   hosts or users.\n   Finally, if a domain chooses\
    \ to contact end users directly concerning\n   their IPv6 impairments, that domain\
    \ should ensure that such\n   communication is permissible under any applicable\
    \ privacy policies of\n   the domain or its websites.\n"
- title: 6.3.  Considerations with Poor IPv4 and Good IPv6 Transport
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Considerations with Poor IPv4 and Good IPv6 Transport\n   There are situations\
    \ where the differing quality of the IPv4 and IPv6\n   connectivity of an end\
    \ user could cause complications in accessing\n   content when a domain is using\
    \ an IPv6 migration tactic.  While today\n   most end users' IPv4 connectivity\
    \ is typically superior to IPv6\n   connectivity (if such connectivity exists\
    \ at all), there could be\n   implications when the reverse is true and an end\
    \ user has markedly\n   superior IPv6 connectivity as compared to IPv4.  This\
    \ is not a\n   theoretical situation; it has been observed by at least one major\n\
    \   content provider.\n   For example, in one possible scenario, a user is issued\
    \ IPv6\n   addresses by their ISP and has a home network and devices or\n   operating\
    \ systems that fully support native IPv6.  As a result, this\n   theoretical user\
    \ has very good IPv6 connectivity.  However, this end-\n   user's ISP has exhausted\
    \ their available pool of unique IPv4\n   addresses, and uses NAT in order to\
    \ share IPv4 addresses among end\n   users.  So, for IPv4 content, the end user\
    \ must send their IPv4\n   traffic through some additional network element (e.g.,\
    \ large-scale\n   NAT, proxy server, tunnel server).  Use of this additional network\n\
    \   element might cause an end user to experience sub-optimal IPv4\n   connectivity\
    \ when certain protocols or applications are used.  This\n   user then has good\
    \ IPv6 connectivity but impaired IPv4 connectivity.\n   As a result, the user's\
    \ poor IPv4 connectivity situation could\n   potentially be exacerbated when accessing\
    \ a domain that is using a\n   migration tactic that causes this user to only\
    \ be able to access\n   content over IPv4 transport for whatever reason.\n   Should\
    \ this sort of situation become widespread in the future, a\n   domain may wish\
    \ to take it into account when deciding how and when to\n   transition content\
    \ to IPv6.\n"
