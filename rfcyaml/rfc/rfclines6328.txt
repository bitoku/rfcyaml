Abstract Some protocols being developed or extended by the IETF make use of the ISO/IEC (International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission)
Network Layer Protocol Identifier (NLPID).
This document provides NLPID IANA considerations.
Some protocols being developed or extended by the IETF make use of the ISO/IEC (International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission)
Network Layer Protocol Identifier (NLPID).
The term "NLPID" is not actually used in [ISO9577], which refers to one octet IPIs (Initial Protocol Identifiers) and SPIs (Subsequent Protocol Identifiers).
While these are two logically separate kinds of one octet identifiers, most values are usable as both an IPI and an SPI.
In the remainder of this document, the term NLPID is used for such values.
The registry of NLPID values is maintained by ISO/IEC by updating [ISO9577].
The procedure specified by ISO/IEC in that document is that an NLPID code point can be allocated without approval by ISO/IEC, as long as the code point is not in a range of values categorized for an organization other than the organization allocating the code point and as long as ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6 is informed.
This document provides NLPID IANA considerations.
That is, it specifies the level of IETF approval necessary for a code point to be allocated for IETF use, the procedures to be used and actions to be taken by IANA in connection with NLPIDs, and related guidelines.
[RFC5226] is incorporated herein except to the extent that there are contrary provisions in this document.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
NLPIDs [ISO9577] defines one octet network layer protocol identifiers that are commonly called NLPIDs, which is the term used in this document.
NLPIDs are used in a number of protocols.
For example, in the mar$pro.type field of the multicast address resolution server protocol [RFC2022], the ar$pro.type field of the NBMA (
next hop resolution protocol [RFC2332]
and in the IS IS
Sub Ranges of the NLPID Sub ranges of the possible NLPID values are categorized by [ISO9577] for organizations as shown below, primarily for the ISO/IEC (International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission) and the ITU T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector):
0xB0 0xBF   ITU T 0xC0 0xCF
Potentially available for IANA (see Section 2.3)
0xF0 0xFE   Joint ITU T and ISO/
Reserved for an Extension mechanism to be jointly developed by ITU T and ISO/IEC 2.2.
NLPID 0x80 is known as the IEEE (Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers)
SNAP (SubNetwork Access Protocol) code point.
It is followed by five octets, using the IEEE SNAP SAP (Service Access Point) conventions, to specify the protocol.
Those conventions are described in Section 3 of [RFC5342].
In particular, it is valid for such a five octet sequence to start with the IANA OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) followed by two further octets assigned by IANA as provided in [RFC5342].
The same IANA registry is used for such protocol identifiers whether they are planned to be introduced by the 0x80 NLPID or the IEEE SNAP SAP LSAPs
(Link Layer Service Access Points)
Values allocated by IANA may be used in either context as appropriate.
Because of the limited number of NLPID code points available for IANA allocation, use of the IEEE SNAP NLPID is RECOMMENDED rather than allocation of a new one octet NLPID code point.
Allocation A limited number of code points are available that could be allocated by IANA under [ISO9577].
Because of this, it is desirable, where practical, to use code point 0x80, as discussed in Section 2.2 above, or to get code points allocated from the ranges categorized to other organizations.
For example, code point 0x8E was allocated for IPv6 [RFC2460], although it is in a range of code points categorized for ISO/IEC.
One byte code points are assigned to TRILL and IEEE 802.1aq as they are intended for use within the IS
The table below, which includes two new code point allocations made by this document, shows those still available.
As long as code points are available, IANA will allocate additional values when required by applying the IETF Review policy as per [RFC5226].
Whenever it allocates an NLPID, IANA will inform the IETF liaison to ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6 (Joint Technical Committee 1, Study Committee 6) [JTC1SC6], or if IANA is unable to determine that IETF liaison, the IAB.
The liaison (or the IAB) will then ensure that ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6 is informed so that [ISO9577] can be updated since ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6 is the body that maintains [ISO9577].
To simplify this process, it is desirable that the IAB maintain an IETF liaison to ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6.
This document allocates the code points 0xC0 and 0xC1
as shown in Section 2.3 and IANA shall request the liaison (or the IAB) to so inform ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6.
IANA maintains a web page showing NLPIDs that have been allocated to a protocol being developed or extended by the IETF or are otherwise of interest.
The initial state of the web page is as shown in
Appendix A.  IANA will update this web page for (1) NLPIDs allocated by IANA and (2) other allocations or de allocations when IANA is requested to make such changes to this web page by the IETF liaison mentioned above.
Security Considerations This document is concerned with allocation of NLPIDs.
It is not directly concerned with security.

ISO CLNP (Connectionless Network Protocol)
According to [RFC1707], NLPID 0x70 was assigned to IPv7.
That assignment appears to no longer be in effect as it is not listed in ISO/IEC 9577.
IPv7 was itself a temporary code point assignment made while a decision was being made between three candidates for the next generation of IP after IPv4.
Those candidates were assigned IPv6, IPv7, and IPv8.
