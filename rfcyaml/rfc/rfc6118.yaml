  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC6117] has obsoleted the IANA registration section of
    [RFC3761].\n   Since the IANA Enumservice registry contains various Enumservices\n
    \  registered under the regime of RFC 3761, those registrations do not\n   conform
    to the new guidelines as specified in [RFC6117].  To ensure\n   consistency among
    all Enumservice registrations at IANA, this\n   document adds the (nowadays) missing
    elements to those legacy\n   registrations.  Furthermore, all legacy Enumservice
    registrations are\n   converted to the new XML-chunk format, and, where deemed
    necessary,\n   minor editorial corrections are applied.\n   However, this document
    only adds the missing elements to the XML\n   chunks as specified in the IANA
    Considerations section of [RFC6117],\n   but it does not complete the (nowadays)
    missing sections of the\n   corresponding Enumservice Specifications.  In order
    to conform with\n   the new registration regime as specified in [RFC6117], those\n
    \  Enumservice Specifications still have to be revised.\n   It is important to
    note that this document does not update the\n   functional specification of the
    concerned Enumservices.\n   The following RFCs are updated by this document:\n
    \  o  [RFC3762]\n   o  [RFC3764]\n   o  [RFC3953]\n   o  [RFC4143]\n   o  [RFC4002]\n
    \  o  [RFC4238]\n   o  [RFC4355]\n   o  [RFC4415]\n   o  [RFC4769]\n   o  [RFC4969]\n
    \  o  [RFC4979]\n   o  [RFC5028]\n   o  [RFC5278]\n   o  [RFC5333]\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"

  - "3.  IESG Action\n   According to [RFC3761], any Enumservice registration had
    to be\n   published as a Standards Track, Experimental, or BCP (Best Current\n
    \  Practice) RFC.  [RFC6117] no longer has this requirement, i.e.,\n   \"Specification
    Required\", which implies the use of a Designated\n   Expert [RFC5226], is sufficient.\n
    \  This document changes the approval requirement for updates to\n   Enumservice
    registrations to Specification Required, whereby the\n   specification and request
    are reviewed by a Designated Expert as\n   described in [RFC6117].\n"

    4.1 - 4.39 refer to the references\n   section within the respective Enumservice

    can\n       be taken as implying that the recipient is capable of receiving\n
    \      EMS or SMS messages at this address.  Such choices on the end\n       system
    design do have two small caveats; whilst in practice all\n       terminals supporting
    MMS today support SMS as well, it might\n       not necessarily be the case in

    section 4.\n       Within and between MMS Environments (MMSE, network\n       infrastructures
    that support the MultiMedia Service), other\n       pieces of state data (for
    example, charging-significant\n       information) are exchanged between MMS Relay
    Servers.  Thus,\n       although these servers use SMTP as the \"bearer\" for
    their\n       application exchanges, they map their internal state to\n       specialised

    information the author deems interesting:\n       The MMS Architecture describes
    an interface between the MMSE and\n       \"legacy messaging systems\" (labelled
    as MM3) which accepts\n       \"standard\" SMTP messages.  Thus although the MMS
    Relay Server\n       that supports this interface appears as a standard SMTP server\n
    \      from the perspective of an Internet-based mail server, it acts\n       as
    a gateway and translator, adding the internal state data that\n       is used
    within and between the MMS Environments.  This mechanism\n       is described
    in [17], which also includes references to the\n       specifications agreed by

    (Public Land Mobile Network) using the value of\n       the generated URI.\n     o
    The kind of subsystem required to initiate a Voice Enumservice\n       with this
    sub-type is a \"Dialler\".  This is a subsystem that\n       either provides a
    local connection to the PSTN or PLMN, or that\n       provides an indirect connection
    to those networks.  The\n       subsystem will use the telephone number held in
    the generated\n       URI to place a voice call.  The voice call is placed to
    a\n       network that uses E.164 numbers to route calls to an appropriate\n       destination.\n
    \    o Note that the PSTN/PLMN connection may be indirect.  The end\n       user
    receiving this NAPTR may have a relationship with a\n       Communications Service
    Provider that accepts call initiation\n       requests from that subsystem using
    an IP-based protocol such as\n       SIP or H.323, and places the call to the
    PSTN using a remote\n       gateway service.  In this case the Provider may either
    accept\n       requests using \"tel:\" URIs or has a defined mechanism to convert\n

    SHOULD NOT be used unless\n       the controller of the zone in which the NAPTR
    appears is sure\n       that it can be distinguished unambiguously by all clients
