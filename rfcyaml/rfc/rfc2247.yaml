  - "1. Abstract\n   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) uses X.500-\n
    \  compatible distinguished names [3] for providing unique\n   identification
    of entries.\n   This document defines an algorithm by which a name registered
    with\n   the Internet Domain Name Service [2] can be represented as an LDAP\n
    \  distinguished name.\n"
  title: 1. Abstract
- contents:
  - "2. Background\n   The Domain (Nameserver) System (DNS) provides a hierarchical
    resource\n   labeling system.   A name is made up of an ordered set of components,\n
    \  each of which are short strings. An example domain name with two\n   components
    would be \"CRITICAL-ANGLE.COM\".\n   LDAP-based directories provide a more general
    hierarchical naming\n   framework. A primary difference in specification of distinguished\n
    \  names from domain names is that each component of an distinguished\n   name
    has an explicit attribute type indication.\n   X.500 does not mandate any particular
    naming structure.  It does\n   contain suggested naming structures which are based
    on geographic and\n   national regions, however there is not currently an established\n
    \  registration infrastructure in many regions which would be able to\n   assign
    or ensure uniqueness of names.\n   The mechanism described in this document automatically
    provides an\n   enterprise a distinguished name for each domain name it has obtained\n
    \  for use in the Internet.  These distinguished names may be used to\n   identify
    objects in an LDAP directory.\n   An example distinguished name represented in
    the LDAP string format\n   [3] is \"DC=CRITICAL-ANGLE,DC=COM\".  As with a domain
    name, the most\n   significant component, closest to the root of the namespace,
    is\n   written last.\n   This document does not define how to represent objects
    which do not\n   have domain names.  Nor does this document define the procedure
    to\n   locate an enterprise's LDAP directory server, given their domain\n   name.
    \ Such procedures may be defined in future RFCs.\n"

  - "3. Mapping Domain Names into Distinguished Names\n   This section defines a subset
    of the possible distinguished name\n   structures for use in representing names
    allocated in the Internet\n   Domain Name System.  It is possible to algorithmically
    transform any\n   Internet domain name into a distinguished name, and to convert
    these\n   distinguished names back into the original domain names.\n   The algorithm
    for transforming a domain name is to begin with an\n   empty distinguished name
    (DN) and then attach Relative Distinguished\n   Names (RDNs) for each component
    of the domain, most significant (e.g.\n   rightmost) first. Each of these RDNs
    is a single\n   AttributeTypeAndValue, where the type is the attribute \"DC\"
    and the\n   value is an IA5 string containing the domain name component.\n   Thus
    the domain name \"CS.UCL.AC.UK\" can be transformed into\n        DC=CS,DC=UCL,DC=AC,DC=UK\n
    \  Distinguished names in which there are one or more RDNs, all\n   containing
    only the attribute type DC, can be mapped back into domain\n   names. Note that
    this document does not define a domain name\n   equivalence for any other distinguished
    names.\n"
  title: 3. Mapping Domain Names into Distinguished Names
- contents:
  - "4. Attribute Type Definition\n   The DC (short for domainComponent) attribute
    type is defined as\n   follows:\n    ( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.25 NAME 'dc' EQUALITY
    caseIgnoreIA5Match\n     SUBSTR caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch\n     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26
    SINGLE-VALUE )\n   The value of this attribute is a string holding one component
    of a\n   domain name.  The encoding of IA5String for use in LDAP is simply the\n
    \  characters of the string itself.  The equality matching rule is case\n   insensitive,
    as is today's DNS.\n"
  title: 4. Attribute Type Definition
- contents:
  - "5. Object Class Definitions\n   An object with a name derived from its domain
    name using the\n   algorithm of section 3 is represented as an entry in the directory.\n
    \  The \"DC\" attribute is present in the entry and used as the RDN.\n   An attribute
    can only be present in an entry held by an LDAP server\n   when that attribute
    is permitted by the entry's object class.\n   This section defines two object
    classes.  The first, dcObject, is\n   intended to be used in entries for which
    there is an appropriate\n   structural object class.  For example, if the domain
    represents a\n   particular organization, the entry would have as its structural\n
    \  object class 'organization', and the 'dcObject' class would be an\n   auxiliary
    class.  The second, domain, is a structural object class\n   used for entries
    in which no other information is being stored. The\n   domain object class is
    typically used for entries that are\n   placeholders or whose domains do not correspond
    to real-world\n   entities.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1. The dcObject object class\n   The dcObject object class permits the dc
      attribute to be present in\n   an entry.  This object class is defined as auxiliary,
      as it would\n   typically be used in conjunction with an existing structural
      object\n   class, such as organization, organizationalUnit or locality.\n   The
      following object class, along with the dc attribute, can be added\n   to any
      entry.\n   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.344 NAME 'dcObject' SUP top AUXILIARY MUST dc
      )\n   An example entry would be:\n   dn: dc=critical-angle,dc=com\n   objectClass:
      top\n   objectClass: organization\n   objectClass: dcObject\n   dc: critical-angle\n
      \  o: Critical Angle Inc.\n"
    title: 5.1. The dcObject object class
  - contents:
    - "5.2. The domain object class\n   If the entry does not correspond to an organization,
      organizational\n   unit or other type of object for which an object class has
      been\n   defined, then the \"domain\" object class can be used.  The \"domain\"\n
      \  object class requires that the \"DC\" attribute be present, and permits\n
      \  several other attributes to be present in the entry.\n   The entry will have
      as its structural object class the \"domain\"\n   object class.\n"

      \  the object represented by this domain, and may also be useful when\n   searching.
      \ These attributes are already defined for use with LDAP\n   [4].\n   An example
