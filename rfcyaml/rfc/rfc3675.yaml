- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   The concept of a .sex, .xxx, .adult, or similar top-level\
    \ domain in\n   which it would be mandatory to locate salacious or similar material\n\
    \   is periodically suggested by some politicians and commentators.\n   Other\
    \ proposals have included a domain reserved exclusively for\n   material viewed\
    \ as appropriate for minors, or using IP address bits\n   or ranges to segregate\
    \ content.\n   In an October 1998 report accompanying the Child Online Protection\n\
    \   Act, the House Commerce committee said, \"there are no technical\n   barriers\
    \ to creating an adult domain, and it would be very easy to\n   block all websites\
    \ within an adult domain\".  The report also said\n   that the committee was wary\
    \ of regulating the computer industry and\n   that any decision by the U.S. government\
    \ \"will have international\n   consequences\" [HOUSEREPORT].\n   British Telecom\
    \ has backed adult top-level domains, saying in a 1998\n   letter to the U.S.\
    \ Department of Commerce that it \"strongly\n   supported\" that plan.  The reason:\
    \ \"Sexually explicit services could\n   then be legally required to operate with\
    \ domain names in this gTLD\n   [that] would make it much simpler and easier to\
    \ control access to\n   such sites...\" [BT].  One of ICANN's progenitors, the\
    \ GTLD-MOU\n   committee, suggested a \"red-light-zone\" top-level domain in a\n\
    \   September 1997 request for comment [GTLD-MOU].\n   Some adult industry executives\
    \ have endorsed the concept.  In 1998,\n   Seth Warshavsky, president of the Internet\
    \ Entertainment Group, told\n   the U.S. Senate Commerce committee that he would\
    \ like to see a .adult\n   domain.  \"We're suggesting the creation of a new top-level\
    \ domain\n   called '.adult' where all sexually explicit material on the Net would\n\
    \   reside,\" Warshavsky said in an interview at the time [WARSHAVSKY].\n   More\
    \ recently, other entrepreneurs in the industry have said that\n   they do not\
    \ necessarily object to the creation of an adult domain as\n   long as they may\
    \ continue to use .com.\n   Conservative groups in the U.S. say they are not eager\
    \ for such a\n   domain, and prefer criminal laws directed at publishers and\n\
    \   distributors of sexually-explicit material.  The National Law Center\n   for\
    \ Children and Families in Fairfax, Virginia, said in February 2001\n   that it\
    \ did not favor any such proposal.  For different reasons, the\n   American Civil\
    \ Liberties Union and other civil liberties groups also\n   oppose it.\n   Sen.\
    \ Joseph Lieberman, the U.S. Democratic Party's vice presidential\n   nominee,\
    \ endorsed the idea at a June 2000 meeting of the federal\n   Commission on Child\
    \ Online Protection.  Lieberman said in a prepared\n   statement that \"we would\
    \ ask the arbiters of the Internet to simply\n   abide by the same standard as\
    \ the proprietor of an X-rated movie\n   theater or the owner of a convenience\
    \ store who sells sexually-\n   explicit magazines\" [LIEBERMAN].\n   In the 1998\
    \ law creating this commission, the U.S. Congress required\n   the members to\
    \ investigate \"the establishment of a domain name for\n   posting of any material\
    \ that is harmful to minors\",  The commission\n   devoted a section of its October\
    \ 2000 report to that topic.  It\n   concluded that both a .xxx and a .kids domain\
    \ are technically\n   possible, but would require action by ICANN.  The report\
    \ said that an\n   adult domain might be only \"moderately effective\" and raises\
    \ privacy\n   and free speech concerns [COPAREPORT].\n   The commission also explored\
    \ the creation of a so-called red zone or\n   green zone for content by means\
    \ of allocation of a new set of IP\n   addresses under IPv6.  Any material not\
    \ in one of those two zones\n   would be viewed as in a gray zone and not necessarily\
    \ appropriate or\n   inappropriate for minors.  Comments from commissioners were\
    \ largely\n   negative: \"Effectiveness would require substantial effort to attach\n\
    \   content to specific IP numbers.  This approach could potentially\n   reduce\
    \ flexibility and impede optimal network performance.  It would\n   not be effective\
    \ at blocking access to chat, newsgroups, or instant\n   messaging\".\n   In October\
    \ 2000, ICANN rejected a .xxx domain during its initial\n   round of approving\
    \ additional top-level domains.  The reasons are not\n   entirely clear, but former\
    \ ICANN Chairwoman Esther Dyson said that\n   the adult industry did not entirely\
    \ agree that such a domain would be\n   appropriate.  One .xxx hopeful, ICM Registry\
    \ of Ontario, Canada, in\n   December 2000 asked ICANN to reconsider its decision\
    \ [ICM-REGISTRY].\n   In 2002, the U.S. Congress mandated the creation of a kids.us\
    \ domain\n   for \"child safe\" material.  This was after being convinced that\
    \ for\n   reasons, some of which are described in the following section, trying\n\
    \   to legislate standards for the whole world with a .kids domain was\n   inappropriate.\n"
- title: 3.  Legal and Philosophical Problems
  contents:
  - "3.  Legal and Philosophical Problems\n   When it comes to sexually-explicit material,\
    \ every person, court, and\n   government has a different view of what's acceptable\
    \ and what is not.\n   Attitudes change over time, and what is viewed as appropriate\
    \ in one\n   town or year may spark protests in the next.  When faced with the\n\
    \   slippery nature of what depictions of sexual activity should be\n   illegal\
    \ or not, one U.S. Supreme Court justice blithely defined\n   obscenity as: \"\
    I know it when I see it\".\n   In the U.S.A., obscenity is defined as explicit\
    \ sexual material that,\n   among other things, violates \"contemporary community\
    \ standards\" -- in\n   other words, even at the national level, there is no agreed-upon\
    \ rule\n   governing what is illegal and what is not.  Making matters more\n \
    \  knotty is that there are over 200 United Nations country codes, and\n   in\
    \ most of them, political subdivisions can impose their own\n   restrictions.\
    \  Even for legal nude modeling, age restrictions differ.\n   They're commonly\
    \ 18 years of age, but only 17 years of age in one\n   Scandinavian country. \
    \ A photographer there conducting what's viewed\n   as a legal and proper photo\
    \ shoot would be branded a felon and child\n   pornographer in the U.S.A.  In\
    \ yet other countries and groups, the\n   entire concept of nude photography or\
    \ even any photography of a\n   person in any form may be religiously unacceptable.\n\
    \   Saudi Arabia, Iran, Northern Nigeria, and China are not likely to\n   have\
    \ the same liberal views as, say, the Netherlands or Denmark.\n   Saudi Arabia\
    \ and China, like some other nations, extensively filter\n   their Internet connection\
    \ and have created government agencies to\n   protect their society from web sites\
    \ that officials view as immoral.\n   Their views on what should be included in\
    \ a .sex domain would hardly\n   be identical to those in liberal western nations.\n\
    \   Those wildly different opinions on sexual material make it\n   inconceivable\
    \ that a global consensus can ever be reached on what is\n   appropriate or inappropriate\
    \ for a .sex or .adult top-level domain.\n   Moreover, the existence of such a\
    \ domain would create an irresistible\n   temptation on the part of conservative\
    \ legislators to require\n   controversial publishers to move to that domain and\
    \ punish those who\n   do not.\n   Some conservative politicians already have\
    \ complained that ICANN did\n   not approve .xxx in its October 2000 meeting.\
    \  During a February 2001\n   hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives, legislators\
    \ warned that\n   they \"want to explore ICANN's rationale for not approving two\n\
    \   particular top level domain names -- .kids and .xxx -- as a means to\n   protect\
    \ kids from the awful smut which is so widespread on the\n   Internet\".\n   It\
    \ seems plausible that only a few adult publishers, and not those\n   who have\
    \ invested resources in building a brand around a .com site,\n   would voluntarily\
    \ abandon their current domain name.  Instead, they'd\n   likely add a .xxx variant\
    \ and keep their original address.  The\n   existence of .xxx could propel legislators\
    \ in the U.S. and other\n   countries to require them to publish exclusively from\
    \ an adult\n   domain, a move that would invite ongoing political interference\
    \ with\n   Internet governance, and raise concerns about forced speech and\n \
    \  self-labeling.\n   In fact, the ultimate arbiter of generic top-level domain\
    \ names -- at\n   least currently -- is not ICANN, but the U.S. government.  The\
    \ U.S.\n   Congress' General Accounting Office in July 2000 reported that the\n\
    \   Commerce Department continues to be responsible for domain names\n   allowed\
    \ by the authoritative root [GAO].  The GAO's auditors\n   concluded it was unclear\
    \ whether the Commerce Department has the\n   \"requisite authority\" under current\
    \ law to transfer that\n   responsibility to ICANN.\n   The American Civil Liberties\
    \ Union -- and other members of the\n   international Global Internet Liberty\
    \ Campaign -- caution that\n   publishers speaking frankly about birth control,\
    \ AIDS prevention, gay\n   and lesbian sex, the social problem of prison rape,\
    \ etc., could be\n   coerced into moving to an adult domain.  Once there, they\
    \ would be\n   stigmatized and easily blocked by schools, libraries, companies,\
    \ and\n   other groups using filtering software.  Publishers of such\n   information,\
    \ who do not view themselves as pornographers and retain\n   their existing addresses,\
    \ could be targeted for prosecution.\n   The existence of an adult top-level domain\
    \ would likely open the door\n   for related efforts, either policy or legislative.\
    \  There are many\n   different axes through which offensive material can be defined:\
    \ Sex,\n   violence, hate, heresy, subversion, blasphemy, illegal drugs,\n   profanity,\
    \ political correctness, glorification of crime, incitement\n   to break the law,\
    \ and so on.  Such suggestions invite the ongoing\n   lobbying of ICANN, the U.S.\
    \ government, and other policy-making\n   bodies by special-interest groups that\
    \ are not concerned with the\n   technical feasibility or practicality of their\
    \ advice.\n   An adult top-level domain could have negative legal repercussions\
    \ by\n   endangering free expression.  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day\n\
    \   O'Connor has suggested that the presence of \"adult zones\" on the\n   Internet\
    \ would make a future Communications Decency Act (CDA) more\n   likely to be viewed\
    \ as constitutional.  In her partial dissent to the\n   Supreme Court's rejection\
    \ of the CDA in 1997 [CDA], O'Connor said\n   that \"the prospects for the eventual\
    \ zoning of the Internet appear\n   promising\".  (The Supreme Court ruled that\
    \ the CDA violated free\n   speech rights by making it a crime to distribute \"\
    indecent\" or\n   \"patently offensive\" material online.)\n   Privacy could be\
    \ harmed by such a proposal.  It would become easier\n   for repressive governments\
    \ and other institutions to track visits to\n   sites in a domain labeled as adult\
    \ and record personally-identifiable\n   information about the visitor.  Repressive\
    \ governments would\n   instantly have more power to monitor naive users and prosecute\
    \ them\n   for their activities.  It's also implausible that a top-level domain\n\
    \   would be effective in controlling access to chat, email, newsgroups,\n   instant\
    \ messaging, and new services as yet to be invented.\n"

  - "4.  Technical Difficulties\n   Even ignoring the philosophical and legal difficulties\
    \ outlined\n   above, there are substantial technical difficulties in attempting\
    \ to\n   impose content classification by domain names or IP addresses.\n   Mandatory\
    \ content labeling is usually advanced with the idea of using\n   a top level\
    \ domain name, discussed in section 4.1., but we also\n   discuss the possibility\
    \ of using IP address bits or ranges in section\n   4.2.\n   In section 4.1.4.,\
    \ difficulties with a few particular higher level\n   protocols are discussed.\
    \  In some cases, these protocols use\n   different name spaces.  It should be\
    \ kept in mind that additional\n   future protocols may be devised with as yet\
    \ undreamed of naming\n   characteristics.\n   We also discuss PICS labels [PICS]\
    \ as an alternative technology in\n   section 4.3.\n   Only a limited technical\
    \ background is assumed, so some basic\n   information is included below.  In\
    \ some cases, descriptions are\n   simplified and details omitted.\n   This technical\
    \ discussion minimizes the definitional problems.\n   However, it is still necessary\
    \ for evaluating some technical\n   considerations to have some estimate of the\
    \ amount of categorization\n   that would be necessary for a realistic global\
    \ censorship system.\n   There is no hope of agreement on this point.  For our\
    \ purposes, we\n   will arbitrarily assume that the world's population consists\
    \ of\n   approximately 90,000 overlapping communities, each of which would\n \
    \  have a different categorization of interest.  Further, we arbitrarily\n   assume\
    \ that some unspecified but clever encoding scheme enables a\n   proper global\
    \ categorization of all information by a 300 bit label.\n   Some would say a 300\
    \ bit label is too large, others that it is too\n   small.  Regardless, we will\
    \ use it for some technical evaluations.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Content Filtering Using Names
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Content Filtering Using Names\n   The most prominent user visible part\
    \ of Internet naming and\n   addressing is the domain name system [RFC 1034, 1035].\
    \  Domain Names\n   are dotted sequences of labels, such as aol.com, world.std.com,\n\
    \   www.rosslynchapel.org.uk, or ftp.gnu.lcs.mit.edu [RFC 1035, 1591,\n   2606].\
    \  Domain Names form an important part of most World Wide Web\n   addresses or\
    \ URLs [RFC 2396], commonly appearing after \"//\".\n   Security for the domain\
    \ name system is being standardized [RFC 2535],\n   but has not been deployed\
    \ to any significant extent.\n   Domain names designate nodes in a globally distributed\
    \ hierarchically\n   delegated database.  A wide variety of information can be\
    \ stored at\n   these nodes, including IP addresses of machines on the network\
    \ (see\n   section 4.2. below), mail delivery information, and other types of\n\
    \   information.  Thus, the data stored at foo.example.com could be the\n   numeric\
    \ information for sending data to a particular machine, which\n   would be used\
    \ if you tried to browse <http://foo.example.com>, the\n   name of a computer\
    \ (say mailhost.example.com) to handle mail\n   addressed to anyone \"@foo.example.com\"\
    , and/or other information.\n   There are also other naming systems in use, such\
    \ as news group names\n   and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel names.\n   The\
    \ usual labeling idea presented is to reserve a top level name,\n   such as .sex\
    \ or .xxx for \"adult\" material and/or .kids for \"safe\"\n   material or the\
    \ like.  The technical and linguistic problems with\n   this are described in\
    \ the subsections below.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  Linguistic Problems
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Linguistic Problems\n   When using name labeling, the first problem is\
    \ from whose language do\n   you take the names to impose?  Words and acronyms\
    \ can have very\n   different meanings in different languages and the probability\
    \ of\n   confusion is multiplied when phonetic collisions are considered.\n  \
    \ As an example of possible problems, note that for several years the\n   government\
    \ of Turkmenistan suspended new registrations in \".tm\",\n   which had previously\
    \ been a source of revenue, because some of the\n   registered second level domain\
    \ names may have been problematic.  In\n   particular, their web home page at\
    \ <http://www.nic.tm> said:\n      Statement from the .TM NIC\n         \"The\
    \ response to the .TM registry has been overwhelming.\n         Thousands of names\
    \ have been registered from all over the\n         world.  Some of the names registered,\
    \ however, may be legally\n         obscene in Turkmenistan, and as a result the\
    \ .TM NIC registry\n         is reviewing its naming policy for future registrations.\
    \  The\n         .TM NIC has suspended registrations until a new policy can be\n\
    \         implemented.  We hope to be live again shortly.\"\n   There are approximately\
    \ 6,000 languages in use in the world today,\n   although this is expected to\

- title: 4.1.2.  Explosion of Top Level Domain Names (TLDs)
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Explosion of Top Level Domain Names (TLDs)\n   An important aspect of\
    \ the design of the Domain Name System (DNS) is\n   the hierarchical delegation\
    \ of data maintenance.  The DNS really only\n   works, and has been able to scale\
    \ over the five orders of magnitude\n   it has grown since its initial deployment,\
    \ due to this delegation.\n   The first problem is that one would expect most\
    \ computers or web\n   sites to have a mix of material, only some of which should\
    \ be\n   specially classified.  Using special top level domain names (TLDs)\n\
    \   multiplies the number of DNS zones the site has to worry about.  For\n   example,\
    \ assume the site has somehow already sorted its material into\n   \"kids\", \"\
    normal\", and \"adult\" piles.  Without special TLD labels, it\n   can store them\
    \ under kids.example.net, adult.example.net, and\n   other.example.net, for instance.\
    \  This would require only the\n   maintenance of the single example.net zone\
    \ of database entries.  With\n   special TLD labeling, at least example.net (for\
    \ normal stuff),\n   example.net.sex, and example.net.kids would need to be maintained,\n\
    \   which are in three separate zones, in different parts of the DNS\n   tree,\
    \ under three separate delegations.\n   As the number of categories expands, the\
    \ number of category\n   combinations explodes, and this quickly becomes completely\n\
    \   unmanageable.  If 300 bits worth of labeling is required, the system\n   could,\
    \ in theory, need 2**300 name categories, an impossibility.  No\n   individual\
    \ site would need to use all categories and the category\n   domain names would\
    \ not all have to be top level names.  But it would\n   still be an unmanageable\
    \ nightmare.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.4.1.  Electronic Mail (SMTP)\n   Standard Internet tools provide no way to\
    \ stop users from putting\n   arbitrary domain names inside email headers.\n \
    \  The standard Internet electronic mail protocol separates \"envelope\"\n   information\
    \ from content [RFC 2821, 2822].  The envelope information\n   indicates where\
    \ a message claims to have originated and to whom it\n   should be delivered.\
    \  The content has fields starting with labels\n   like \"From:\" and \"To:\"\
    , but these content fields actually have no\n   effect and can be arbitrarily\
    \ forged using simple, normally available\n   software, such a telnetting to the\
    \ SMTP port on a mail server.\n   Content fields are not compared with envelope\
    \ fields.  To require\n   them to be the same would be like requiring that postal\
    \ letters\n   deposited in a mail box list that mail box as their return address\n\
    \   and only allowing residence or business return addresses on mail\n   picked\
    \ up by the post office from that residence or business.\n   While different mail\
    \ clients display envelope information and headers\n   from the content of email\
    \ differently, generally the principle\n   content fields are given prominence.\
    \  Thus, while not exactly the\n   same as content labeling, it should be noted\
    \ that it is trivial to\n   send mail to anyone with arbitrary domain names in\
    \ the email\n   addresses appearing in the From and To headers, etc.\n   It is\
    \ also easy up set up a host to forward mail to an email address\n   or mailing\
    \ list.  Mail sent with normal mail tools to this forwarder\n   will automatically\
    \ have content headers reflecting the forwarder's\n   name, but the forwarder\
    \ will change the envelope information and\n   cause the mail to be actually sent\
    \ to the forwarding destination mail\n   address.\n   For example, (with names\
    \ disguised) there is a social mailing list\n   innocuous@foo.example.org, and\
    \ someone set up a forwarder at\n   cat-torturers@other.example.  Mail sent to\
    \ the forwarder is forwarded\n   and appears on the innocuous mailing list but\
    \ with a \"To:  cat-\n   torturers@other.example\" header in its body, instead\
    \ of the usual\n   \"To: innocuous@foo.example.org\" content header.  Mail reader\
    \ software\n   then displays the cat-torturers header.  Similar things can be\
    \ done\n   using the \"bcc\" or \"blind courtesy copy\" feature of Internet mail.\n\
    \   There is work proceeding on securing email; however, such efforts at\n   present\
    \ only allow you to verify whether or not a particular entity\n   was the actual\
    \ author of the mail.  When providing authentication,\n   they add yet a third\
    \ type of \"From\" address to the envelope and\n   content \"From\" addresses,\
    \ but they do not relate to controlling or\n   authenticating domain names in\
    \ the content of the mail.\n"

    \ HTTP 1.1 [RFC 2616],\n   the domain name used to access the site is available.\
    \  Thus, web\n   sites with different domain names can be accessed even if they\
    \ are on\n   the same machine at the same IP address.  This is a small plus for\n\
    \   name-based labeling since different categories of information on the\n   same\
    \ computer can be set up to be accessed via different domain\n   names.  But for\
    \ a computer with any reasonable variety of data, the\n   explosion of trying\
    \ to differently name all types of data would\n   require an unmanageable number\
    \ of names.\n   With earlier HTTP 1.0 [RFC 1945], when a web request was sent\
    \ to a\n   server machine, the original domain name used in the URI was not\n\
    \   included.\n   On the other hand, the web has automatic forwarding.  Thus,\
    \ when one\n   tries to access data at a particular domain name, the server there\n\
    \   can re-direct your browser, temporarily or permanently, to a\n   different\

  contents:
  - "4.1.4.3.  News (NNTP)\n   Net news [RFC 977, 2980] uses hierarchically structured\
    \ newsgroup\n   names that are similar in appearance to domain names, except that\
    \ the\n   most significant label is on the left and the least on the right, the\n\
    \   opposite of domain names.  However, while the names are structured\n   hierarchically,\
    \ there is no central control.  Instead, news servers\n   periodically connect\
    \ to other news servers that have agreed to\n   exchange messages with them and\
    \ they update each other on messages\n   only in those newsgroups in which they\
    \ wish to exchange messages.\n   Although hierarchical zones in the domain name\
    \ system are locally\n   managed, they need to be reachable starting at the top\
    \ level root\n   servers which are in turn more or less controlled by ICANN and\
    \ the US\n   Department of Commerce.  With no such central point or points in\
    \ the\n   net news world, any pair or larger set of news servers anywhere in\n\
    \   the world can agree to exchange news messages under any news group\n   names\
    \ they like, including duplicates of those used elsewhere in the\n   net, making\
    \ central control or even influence virtually impossible.\n   In fact, within\
    \ some parts of the news group namespace on some\n   servers, anyone can create\
    \ new newsgroups with arbitrary names.\n   Even if news group names could be controlled,\
    \ the contents of the\n   messages are determined by posters.  While some groups\
    \ are moderated,\n   most are not.  \"Cancel\" messages can be sent out for news\
    \ messages,\n   but that mechanism is subject to abuse, so some servers are\n\
    \   configured to ignore cancels.  In any case, the message may have been\n  \
    \ distributed to a huge number of computers world wide before any\n   cancel is\
    \ sent out.\n   And of course, fitting 300 bits worth of labeling into news group\n\
    \   names is just as impossible as it is to fit into domain names.\n"

- title: 4.2.  Content Filtering Using IP Addressing
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Content Filtering Using IP Addressing\n   A key characteristic of the Internet\
    \ Protocol (IP) on which the\n   Internet is based is that it breaks data up into\
    \ \"packets\".  These\n   packets are individually handled and routed from source\
    \ to\n   destination.  Each packet carries a numeric address for the\n   destination\
    \ point to which the Internet will try to deliver the\n   packet.\n   (End users\
    \ do not normally see these numeric addresses but instead\n   deal with \"domain\
    \ names\" as described in section 4.1. above.)\n   The predominant numeric address\
    \ system now in use is called IPv4, or\n   Internet Protocol Version 4, which\
    \ provides for 32 bit addresses [RFC\n   791].  There is increasing migration\
    \ to the newer IPv6 [RFC 2460],\n   which provides for 128 bit addresses [RFC\
    \ 2373, 2374].\n   Packets can be modified maliciously in transit but the most\
    \ common\n   result of this is denial of service.\n   One problem in using addressing\
    \ for content filtering is that this is\n   a very coarse technique.  IP addresses\
    \ refer to network interfaces,\n   which usually correspond to entire computer\
    \ systems which could house\n   multiple web pages, sets of files, etc., only\
    \ a small part of which\n   it was desired to block or enable.  Increasingly,\
    \ a single IP address\n   may correspond to a NAT (Network Address Translation)\
    \ box [RFC 2663]\n   which hides multiple computers behind it, although in that\
    \ case,\n   these computers are usually not servers.\n   However, even beyond\
    \ this problem of coarse granularity, the\n   practical constraints of hierarchical\
    \ routing make the allocation of\n   even a single IPv4 address bit or a significant\
    \ number of IPv6\n   address bits impossible.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Hierarchical Routing
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Hierarchical Routing\n   IP addresses are technically inappropriate for\
    \ content filtering\n   because their assignment is intimately tied to network\
    \ routing and\n   topology.\n   As packets of data flow through the Internet,\
    \ decisions must be made\n   as to how to forward them \"towards\" their destination.\
    \  This is done\n   by comparing the initial bits of the packet destination address\
    \ to\n   entries in a \"routing table\" and forwarding the packets as indicated\n\
    \   by the table entry with the longest prefix match.\n   While the Internet is\
    \ actually a mesh, if, for simplicity, we\n   consider it to have a central backbone\
    \ at the \"top\", a packet is\n   typically routed as follows:\n   The local networking\
    \ code looks at its routing table to determine if\n   the packet should be sent\
    \ directly to another computer on the \"local\"\n   network, to a router to specially\
    \ forward it to another nearby\n   network, or routed \"up\" to a \"default\"\
    \ router to forward it to a\n   higher level service provider's network.  If the\
    \ packet's destination\n   is \"far enough away\", it will eventually get forwarded\
    \ up to a router\n   on the backbone.  Such a router cannot send the packet \"\
    up\" since it\n   is at the top, or \"default free\" zone, and must have a complete\
    \ table\n   of other top level routers in which to send the packet.  Currently,\n\
    \   such top level routers are very large and expensive devices.  They\n   must\
    \ be able to maintain tables of tens of thousands of routes.  When\n   the packet\
    \ gets to the top level router of the part of the network\n   within which its\
    \ destination lies, it gets forwarded \"down\" to\n   successive routers which\
    \ are more and more specific and local until\n   eventually it gets to a router\
    \ on the local network where its\n   destination address lies.  This local router\
    \ sends the packet\n   directly to the destination computer.\n   Because all of\
    \ these routing decisions are made on a longest prefix\n   match basis, it can\
    \ be seen that IP addresses are not general names\n   or labels, but are critically\
    \ and intimately associated with the\n   actual topology and routing structure\
    \ of the network.  If they were\n   assigned at random, routers would be required\
    \ to remember so many\n   specific routes for specific addresses that it would\
    \ far exceed the\n   current technical capabilities for router design.  The Internet\
    \ would\n   be fatally disrupted and would not work.\n   It should also be noted\
    \ that there is some inefficiency in allocation\n   at each level of hierarchy\
    \ [RFC 1715].  Generally, allocations are of\n   a power of two addresses and\
    \ as requirements grow and/or shrink, it\n   is not practical to use every address.\n\

- title: 4.2.3.  IP Version 6 Addresses
  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  IP Version 6 Addresses\n   IPv6 provides 128 bit address fields [RFC\
    \ 2373, 2374].  Furthermore,\n   allocation of IPv6 addresses is in its infancy.\
    \  Thus, the allocation\n   of say, one bit of IPv6 address for labeling is conceivable.\n\
    \   However, as discussed above (section 4.2.1.), every high bit\n   allocated\
    \ for labeling doubles the cost imposed on the routing\n   system.  Allocating\
    \ one bit would generally double the size of\n   routing tables.\n   Allocating\
    \ two bits would multiply them by four.  Allocating the 300\n   bits we assume\

    \ were possible, would\n   impossibly multiply table sizes by a million.\n   Allocating\

    \ a\n   generalized system for providing \"ratings\" for Internet accessible\n\
    \   material.  The PICS documents [PICS] should be consulted for details.\n  \
    \ In general, PICS assumes an arbitrarily large number of rating\n   services\
    \ and rating systems.  Each service and system is identified\n   by a URL.\n \
    \  It would be quite reasonable to have multiple PICS services that, in\n   the\
    \ aggregate, provided 300 bits of label information or more.  There\n   could\
    \ be a PICS service for every community of interest.  This sort\n   of technology\
    \ is really the only reasonable way to make\n   categorizations or labelings of\
    \ material available in a diverse and\n   dynamic world.\n   While such PICS label\
    \ services could be used to distribute government\n   promulgated censorship categories,\
    \ for example, it is not clear how\n   this is any worse than government censorship\
    \ via national firewalls.\n   A PICS rating system is essentially a definition\
    \ of one or more\n   dimensions and the numeric range of the values that can be\
    \ assigned\n   in each dimension to a rated object.  A service is a source of\
    \ labels\n   where a label includes actual ratings.  Ratings are either specific\n\
    \   or generic.  A specific rating applies only to the material at a\n   particular\
    \ URL [RFC 2396] and does not cover anything referenced from\n   it, even included\
    \ image files.  A generic rating applies to the\n   specified URL and to all URLs\
    \ for which the stated URL is a prefix.\n   A simplified example label might look\
    \ like the following:\n      (PICS-1.1 \"http://movie-rating-service.example.net\"\
    \n         labels for \"ftp://movies.example.sex/raunchy-movie\"\n         ratings\

    \  Additional information, such\n   as beginning and ending time of validity,\

    \ in three ways: (1) embedded in\n   HTML, (2) provided with data in an HTTP response,\
    \ and (3) separately\n   from a third party.  If content is required to have labels\
    \ embedded\n   in it or transmitted by the source when data is returned, as in\
    \ the\n   first two ways listed above, it raises the problems of categorization\n\
    \   granularity and forced speech.  However, if used in the third way\n   whereby\
    \ a separate party determines and provides labels for content,\n   and users are\
