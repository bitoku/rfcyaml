- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document proposes new media sub-types of Text/SGML and\n  \
    \ Application/SGML.  These media types can be used in the exchange of\n   SGML\
    \ documents and their entities.  Specific details for the exchange\n   or encapsulation\
    \ of groups of related SGML entities using MIME are\n   currently being considered\
    \ by the mimesgml Working Group <sgml-\n   internet@ebt.com>.\n"
- title: 1.      Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.      Introduction\n   A need exists for the transfer the elements of documents\
    \ constructed\n   using the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) [ISO-8879].\n\
    \   While the specific details of such transfers are being considered\n   general\
    \ agreement exists on the need to register basic media types\n   for the SGML\
    \ entities not covered by existing types.\n   The Standard Generalized Markup\
    \ Language (SGML) is used to encode\n   document structure and a rigorous description\
    \ of it is left to [ISO-\n   8879].  The terms used in the present document attempt\
    \ to be\n   consistent with SGML terminology and usage.\n"
- title: 2.       The SGML Media-Types
  contents:
  - "2.       The SGML Media-Types\n   There are two media-types for SGML parsable\
    \ entities, Text/SGML and\n   Application/SGML.  Both have the same optional parameters.\
    \  Text/SGML\n   provides a fallback to Text/Plain for those without SGML capability.\n\
    \   Senders should base the choice between text and application media-\n   types\
    \ on the entity's content.  Text is suggested for entities that\n   would be meaningful\
    \ to a human being without SGML processing.\n   Application/SGML is recommended\
    \ for all others.\n"

    \ Text/SGML is defined in\n                   [RFC-1521], the valid values and\
    \ their meaning are\n                   registered by the Internet Assigned Numbers\n\
    \                   Authority (IANA) [RFC-1590].  The default charset\n      \
    \             value for all Text content-types is \"us-ascii\"\n             \
    \      [RFC-1521].\n                   The charset parameter is provided to permit\
    \ non-\n                   SGML capable systems to provide reasonable\n      \
    \             behavior when Text/SGML defaults to Text/Plain.\n              \
    \     SGML capable systems will use the SGML-bctf param-\n                   eter.\n\
    \       SGML-bctf   The SGML-bctf (SGML bit combination transformation\n     \

    \     transform the entity's sequence of constant width\n                   binary\
    \ numbers (called \"bit combinations\" in [ISO\n                   8879, 4.24])\

    \              a MIME body part (Application/Octet-stream) that\n            \
    \       satisfies the requirements of the boot attribute\n                   in\
    \ [ISO-10744].  The Appendix contains a summary\n                   of those requirements.\
    \  The SGML-boot parameter is\n                   only applicable if the SGML\

  - "3.      Security Considerations\n   SGML entities contain information to be parsed\
    \ and processed by the\n   recipient's SGML system.  Those entities may contain\
    \ and such systems\n   may permit explicit system level commands to be execute\
    \ while\n   processing the data.  To the extent that an SGML system will execute\n\
    \   arbitrary command strings recipients of SGML entities may be at risk.\n  \
    \ Parsable SGML entities may also contain explicit processing\n   instructions\
    \ for a presentation or composition system; use of such\n   instructions present\
    \ concerns similar to those of\n   Application/PostScript.\n"

  - "A.2.    The Boot Attribute\n   The body part specified by the SGML-boot parameter\

    \ space.\n   The triplets correspond to the described character set portion [IS0-\n\
    \   8879, 13.1.1.2] of the SGML declaration.  SGML-boot provides the\n   capability\
    \ to identify the character set of the document's SGML\n   declaration when it\
    \ uses significant SGML characters [ibid., 4.298]\n   in the SGML reference concrete\
    \ syntax [ibid., 13.4] that have a\n   character number [ibid., 4.44] in the document's\
    \ character set that\n   differs from us-ascii.  The default value is \"0 128\
    \ 0\", all\n   characters are us-ascii.\n   Notes: (1) The triplet, <dscn noc\
    \ bscn> has the following meaning.\n   Starting with character number dscn in\
    \ the us-ascii character set,\n   renumber noc characters starting at bscn and\
    \ incrementing by one.\n   Thus, 0 128 0, represents the identity mapping.  (2)\
    \ The document's\n   declaration itself may also redefine the significant SGML\
    \ characters;\n   the boot attribute is intended to bootstrap the SGML system's\
    \ parse\n   of the declaration.\n"
