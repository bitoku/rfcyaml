Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines a minimal set of managed objects for SNMP  based management of ISDN terminal interfaces.
ISDN interfaces are supported on a variety of equipment (for data and voice) including terminal adapters, bridges, hosts, and routers.
This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI.
The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.
This document is a product of the ISDN MIB working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force.
Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at isdn  mib@cisco.com and/or the author.
The current version of this document reflects changes made during the last call period and the IESG review.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework presently consists of three major components.
[1] the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
the MIB II, STD 17, RFC 1213
[2] the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
the protocol, STD 15, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], the protocol for accessing managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
In case of ISDN primary rate, this are usually T1 or E1 lines, being managed in the DS1/E1 MIB [12].
For Basic Rate lines, physical interfaces are managed by this MIB.
Information for managing B channels.
Information for managing signaling channels.
Optionally, information for managing Terminal Endpoints (TE).
A Terminal Endpoint is a link layer connection to a switch.
Optionally, information for managing a list of directory numbers.
In order to manage connections over ISDN lines, the management of peer information and call history information is required as well.
This information is defined in the Dial Control MIB [15].
The purpose for splitting the required information in two MIBs is to be able to use parts of this information for non ISDN interfaces as well.
In particular, the Dial Control MIB might also be used for other types of interfaces, e.g. modems or X.25 virtual connections.
Within this document, information has been structured into five groups, which are described in the following chapters.
This MIB controls all aspects of ISDN interfaces.
It consists of five groups.
The isdnMibBasicRateGroup is used to provide information regarding physical Basic Rate interfaces.
The isdnMibBearerGroup is used to control B (bearer) channels.
It supports configuration parameters as well as statistical information related to B channels.
The isdnMibSignalingGroup is used to control D (delta) channels.
There are three tables in this group.
The isdnSignalingTable and isdnSignalingStatsTable support ISDN Network Layer configuration and statistics.
The isdnLapdTable supports ISDN Data Link Layer (LAPD) configuration and statistics.
The optional isdnMibEndpointGroup can be used to specify Terminal Endpoints.
It is required only if there are non ISDN endpoints defined for a given D channel, or if additional information like Terminal Endpoint Identifier (TEI) values or Service Profile IDentifiers (SPID) is required to identify a given ISDN user.
The optional isdnMibDirectoryGroup can be used to specify a list of directory numbers for each signaling channel.
It is required only if the directory numbers to be accepted
differ from the isdnSignalingCallingAddress as specified in the isdnSignalingTable.
Relationship to the Interfaces MIB
This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB to the Interfaces MIB [11].
Several areas of correlation are addressed in the following subsections.
The implementor is referred to the Interfaces MIB document in order to understand the general intent of these areas.
An ISDN interface usually consists of a D channel and a number of B channels, all of which are layered on top of a physical interface.
Furthermore, there are multiple interface layers for each D channel.
There are Data Link Layer (LAPD) as well as Network Layer entities.
This is accomplished in this MIB by creating a logical interface (ifEntry) for each of the D channel entities and a logical interface (ifEntry) for each of the B channels.
These are then correlated to each other and to the physical interface using the ifStack table of the Interfaces MIB [11].
Mapping of B/D channels to physical interfaces
Each D channel can support multiple Terminal Endpoints.
Terminal Endpoints can either be one or multiple ISDN signaling channels, or channels supporting X.25 based packet mode services.
To accomplish this, there can be multiple Network Layer entities on top of each ISDN Data Link Layer (LAPD) interface.
Detailed interface mapping IfEntries are maintained for each D channel Network Layer entity (Terminal Endpoint), for LAPD and for each B channel.
The ifType for a Terminal Endpoint can be isdn(63) for ISDN signaling channels or x25ple(40) for X.25 based packet mode services.
The ifType for D channel
Data Link Layer (LAPD) interfaces is lapd(77).
The ifType for B channels is ds0(81).
The ifType for physical interfaces is the matching IANA ifType, usually ds1(18) for Primary Rate interfaces or isdns(75)/isdnu(76) for Basic Rate interfaces.
The ifStackTable is used to map B channels and LAPD interfaces to physical interfaces and to map D channel Network Layer interfaces (Terminal Endpoints) to LAPD.
In the example given above, the assignment of index values could for example be as follows:
The corresponding ifStack table entries would then be: ifStackTable
7 Mapping of B channels to upper interface layers is usually done using the Dial Control MIB.
In this model, ifEntries are maintained for each peer.
Each peer is required to have an associated ifEntry.
This interface can be of any kind, e.g. PPP or LAPB.
The Dial Control MIB can be used for all types of demand access interfaces, e.g., ISDN, modems or X.25 virtual connections.
The ifTestTable is not supported by this MIB.
The ifRcvAddressTable is not supported by this MIB.
ifEntry for a Basic Rate hardware interface
The ifGeneralGroup is supported for Basic Rate hardware interfaces.
Each ISDN Basic Rate hardware interface is represented by an ifEntry.
The overall bandwidth of this interface.
The administrative status of the ISDN interface.
The current operational status of this interface.
The operational status is dormant(5)
if the interface is in standby mode, i.e. connected to the network, but without call activity.
The operational status is down(2) if the hardware has detected that there is no layer 1 connection to the switch.
For other values, refer to the Interfaces MIB.

3.3.  Relationship to other MIBs 3.3.1.
MIB Implementation of the DS1/E1 MIB [12] is not required for supporting this MIB.
It is however recommended to implement the DS1/E1 MIB on entities supporting Primary Rate interfaces.
Relationship to the DS0 and DS0Bundle MIBs Implementation of the DS0 MIB
Implementation of the DS0Bundle MIB [13] may be required only if hyperchannels are to be supported, depending on the multiplexing scheme used in a given implementation.
See chapter 3.4.2 for details on how to implement hyperchannels.
Relationship to the Dial Control
MIB Implementation of the Dial Control MIB [15] is required.
ISDN interface specific information and implementation hints 3.4.1.
ISDN leased lines can be specified on a per B channel basis.
To do so, the value of isdnBearerChannelType has to be set to leased(2).
There is no signaling protocol support for leased line B channels, since there is no signaling protocol action for these kinds of interfaces.
If there is no signaling support available for an ISDN interface, this must be specified in the appropriate interface specific table.
For Basic Rate interfaces, isdnBasicRateSignalMode of isdnBasicRateTable must be set to inactive(2).
For Primary Rate interfaces, dsx1SignalMode of dsx1ConfigTable in DS1/E1 MIB [12] must be set to none(1).
There are no isdnLapdTable or isdnSignalingTable entries for such interfaces.
Depending on the leased line type and the service provider, the D channel can be used for data transfer.
If this is the case the D channel interface type is ds0(81) instead of lapd(77) and its usage is identical to B channel usage if there is no signaling channel available.
For a Primary Rate interface which is entirely used as a leased line, there is no ISDN specific information available or required.
Such leased lines can entirely be handled by the DS1/E1 MIB.
The active switch protocol defines if hyperchannels are supported, and the actual support is implementation dependent.
Hyperchannel connections will be requested by the interface user at call setup time, e.g. by the peer connection handling procedures.
In the ISDN MIB, the isdnBearerMultirate object of isdnBearerTable can be used to check if hyperchannels are being used for an active call.
If hyperchannels are being used, multiplexing between the encapsulation layer and the B channels is required, since there is one encapsulation layer interface connected to several B channel interfaces.
This can be accomplished in two ways.
The DS0Bundle MIB [13] can be used to provide the multiplexing.
See the DS0Bundle MIB document for details.
The ifStackTable can be used to provide the multiplexing.
In this case, there are several ifStackTable entries with the same value of HigherLayer, and different values of LowerLayer.
It is up to the implementor to decide which multiplexing scheme to use.
Each hyperchannel call is treated as one call in the isdnSignalingStatsTable, independent of the number of B channels involved.
For a hyperchannel call, all objects in the isdnBearerTable entries related to this call (i.e., all isdnBearerTable entries associated to B channels used by the hyperchannel) have identical values.
The related objects in the isdnBearerTable are: isdnBearerPeerAddress isdnBearerPeerSubAddress isdnBearerCallOrigin
isdnBearerInfoType isdnBearerMultirate isdnBearerCallSetupTime isdnBearerCallConnectTime isdnBearerChargedUnits 3.4.3.
D channel backup and NFAS trunks D channel backup is defined in Q.931 [8], Annex F.
Associated signaling and its use and functionality is basically identical to Non Facility Associated Signaling (NFAS) trunks.
Non Facility Accociated Signaling (NFAS) basically means that a D channel on a PRI interface is used to manage calls on other PRI trunks.
This is required in North America for H11 channels, since all 24 time slots are being used for B channels.
According to Q.931, Annex F, the D channel backup feature can be provided on a subscription basis and is network dependent.
The D channel backup procedure is described in detail in Q.931.
For D channel backup, the controlling isdnSignalingTable entry is layered on top of all attached LAPD interfaces.
This layering is done using the ifStack table.
There is only one active LAPD interface, however.
Inactive LAPD interfaces have an ifOperStatus of dormant(5).
NFAS trunks are also handled using the ifStack table.
In this case, a signaling channel is layered on top of a LAPD interface as well as on top of all physical interfaces which are controlled by the signaling channel, but do not supply a D channel.
X.25 based packet mode service in B and D channels
X.25 based packet mode service over B channels can be handled using the Dial Control MIB by creating an appropriate peer entry.
The peer entry ifType can then be x25(5), thus providing access to X.25 service.
X.25 based packet mode service over D channels can be handled by creating an ifEndpointTable entry with an isdnEndpointIfType of x25ple(40).
The upper protocol layers can then be attached to this interface using the ifStack table.
SPID handling Service Profile IDentifiers (SPIDs) are defined for BRI interfaces only, and being used in North America.
SPIDs are required for DMS  100, NI 1 and NI 2, and are optional for 5ESS.
A switch can define up to 8 SPIDs per BRI.
Each Terminal Endpoint has a SPID assigned.
It is normally built from the party number (calling address for outgoing calls) with a number of digits prepended and appended.
Since each network appears to be different, both the calling address and the SPID have to be stored.
The SPID identifies the particular services that have been provisioned for a terminal.
If there are two B channels on a BRI, there can be two SPIDs, one for each of the two B channels.
There can also be a single SPID, providing access to both B channels.
The SPID gets registered with the switch after link establishment.
There is one data link for each SPID.
As part of terminal registration, an EID (Endpoint IDentifier) is defined by the switch.
On incoming calls, the switch may provide the EID, a called party number, or both, depending on the ISDN code implemented in the switch.
The EID has two bytes: USID (User Service IDentifier) and TID (Terminal IDentifier).
These are later used by some of the software versions running on the switch side (e.g. compliant with NI 1, 5ESS custom) to broadcast SETUP messages with these included, so the correct endpoint would accept the call.
Other switch software versions identify the endpoint with the Called Party Number.
In the ISDN MIB, the SPID can be entered using the isdnEndpointSpid object of isdnEndpointTable.
The isdnSignalingCallingAddress, already being used to specify the calling number, cannot be used to record the SPID since the values of the SPID and the Calling Address may differ and both may be required to be present.
Closed User Groups Closed User Groups (CUG), as defined in I.255.1 [14], are supported for circuit mode calls by ETSI (ETS 300 138) and 1TR6.
In these networks, an ISDN address can have one or more Closed User Groups assigned.
If there is more than one Closed User Group assigned to a given address, one of those is the preferred Closed User Group.
For such addresses, only calls from assigned Closed User Groups are accepted by the network.
Thus, Closed User Groups are a parameter for peer entries and are defined in the Dial Control MIB.
A peer entry attached to a Closed User Group has to point to an ISDN interface which is attached to the Closed User Group in question.
Provision of point to point line topology In the ISDN standards
, there are two different meanings for the term "point to point".
In ISDN standards, the term point to point are usually used for data link connections, i.e. layer 2 connections, where each layer 2 connection from the TE to the network is a single point to point connection.
Multiple connections of this kind may exist on one physical (layer 1) connection, however, and in case of Basic Rate interfaces there may be several TE's connected to one physical line to the network.
The second meaning of "point to point" refers to the line topology, i.e.  to layer 1 connections.
For Primary Rate interfaces, the line topology is always point to point.
For Basic Rate interfaces, layer 1 point to  point connections do exist in several countries, usually being used for connecting PBX systems to the network.
The second meaning (layer 1 connections) is what will be referred to as "point to point" connection throughout this document.
For Basic Rate interfaces, the isdnBasicRateTable object isdnBasicRateLineTopology can be used to select the line topology.
Speech and audio bearer capability information elements The objects speech(2),
audio31(6) and audio7(7), as being used in isdnBearerInfoType, refer to the Speech, 3.1 kHz Audio and old 7
kHz Audio (now Multi use) bearer capabilities for ISDN, as defined in Q.931 [8], chapter 4.5.5, octet 3 of bearer capability information element.
These capabilities are signaling artifices that allow networks to do certain things with the call.
It is up to the network to decide what to do.
The Speech Bearer Capability means that speech is being carried over the channel, as in two people talking.
This would be POTS type speech.
The network may compress this, encrypt it or whatever it wants with it as long as it delivers POTS quality speech to the other end.
In other words, a modem is not guaranteed to work over this connection.
The 3.1 kHz Audio capability indicates that the network carries the 3.1 kHz bandwidth across the network.
This would (theoretically) allow modem signals to be carried across the network.
In the US, the network automatically enters a capability of 3.1 kHz Audio on calls coming into the ISDN from a POTS network.
This capability restricts the network from interfering with the data channel in a way that would corrupt the 3.1 kHz VoiceBand data.
kHz Audio was meant to signal the use of a higher quality audio connection (e.g., music from radio).
It was changed to Multi Use capability to allow it to be used for video conferencing with fall back to audio.
In some cases, the Speech or 3.1 kHz Bearer Capability provides a 56 kbit/s data path through the network.
Therefore, some people are setting up calls with the Speech or 3.1 kHz BC and transmitting 56 kbit/s data over the connection.
This is usually to take advantage of favorable tariffs for Speech as opposed to Data.
On the incoming side, the equipment is usually configured to ignore the Bearer Capability and either answer all Speech calls as 56 kbit/s data or to use one Directory Number for real speech and another for data.
Attaching incoming calls to router ports In ISDN, there are several ways to identify an incoming call and to attach a router port to this call.
The call can be identified and attached to a router port using the ISDN Calling Address, that is, the peer ISDN address.
Since the peer address is defined in a Dial Control MIB configuration entry for this peer, this would be the most natural way to attach an incoming call to a router port.
In this configuration, only a single isdnSignalingTable entry is required for each physical ISDN interface.
Unfortunately, the ISDN Calling Address is not available in all countries and/or switch protocols.
Therefore, other means for attaching incoming calls
to router ports must be provided.
The call can also be identified and attached to a router port using the ISDN Called Address.
In this case, a distinct ISDN address or subaddress must be specified for each of the router ports.
This can be accomplished in the ISDN MIB by creating a isdnSignalingTable entry for each of the router ports, and by connecting Dial Control MIB peer entries to the thereby created interface using the dialCtlPeerCfgLowerIf object of dialCtlPeerCfgTable.
If this type of router port identification is used in an implementation, it is up to the implementor to decide if there should be distinct TEI values assigned for each of the isdnSignalingTable entries.
For this reason, the isdnEndpointTable permits specifying the same TEI value in multiple entries.
It is recommended to use dynamic TEI assignment whenever possible.
The implementor should be aware that this type of configuration requires a lot of configuration work for the customer, since an entry in isdnSignalingTable must be created for each of the router ports.
Incoming calls can also be identified and attached to router ports using a higher layer functionality, such as PPP authentication.
Defining this functionality is outside the scope of this document.
Usage of isdnMibDirectoryGroup and isdnDirectoryTable In some switch protocol or PBX implementations, the Called Number Information Element on incoming calls can differ from the Calling Number on outgoing calls.
Sometimes, the Called Number can be different for incoming Local Calls, Long Distance Calls and International Calls.
For Hunt Groups, the Called Number can be any of the numbers in the Hunt Group.
The isdnDirectoryTable can be used to specify all these numbers.
Entries in the isdnDirectoryTable are always connected to specific isdnSignalingTable entries.
No ifEntry is created for isdnDirectoryTable entries.
Therefore, the isdnDirectoryTable can not be used to attach incoming calls to router ports.
For router port identification, isdnSignalingTable entries should be created instead.

The MIB module to describe the management of ISDN interfaces."
For basic rate lines, the media specifics for the physical interface   is defined in the physical interface group of the ISDN MIB.
The ifType for physical basic rate interfaces is isdns(75)   or isdnu(76), whichever is appropriate.
For primary rate, the media specifics are defined in the Trunk   MIB and the ifType has a value of ds1(18).
Each signaling channel is represented by an entry   in the isdnSignalingTable.
The signaling channel has an ifType value of isdn(63).
Each B channel is also represented as an entry   in the ifTable.
The B channels have an ifType value   of ds0(81).
This model is used while defining objects and tables   for management.
The ISDN MIB allows sub layers.
For example, the data transfer   over a B channel may take place with PPP encapsulation.
While the   ISDN MIB describes the D and B channels, a media specific MIB   for PPP can be used on a layered basis.
This is as per   the interfaces MIB.
"This data type is used as the syntax of the isdnSignalingProtocol object in the definition of ISDN MIB's isdnSignalingTable.
The definition of this textual convention with the addition of newly assigned values is published periodically by the IANA, in either the Assigned Numbers RFC, or some derivative of it specific to Internet Network Management number assignments.
(The latest arrangements can be obtained by contacting the IANA.)
Requests for new values should be made to IANA via email (iana@iana.org).

There is one entry in this table for each Terminal Endpoint
(link layer connection to the switch).
Usually, there is one endpoint per D channel.
In some   cases, however, there can be multiple endpoints.
Thus, entries in this table can be created and deleted.
This also means the creation of an associated ifEntry.
D channel backup and NFAS trunks are handled using the   ifStack table.
In case of D channel backup, there are multiple   Data Link Layer (LAPD) interfaces.
Only one interface is   active; all others are dormant(5).
In case of NFAS trunks, one lower interface is the   LAPD interface, while the other lower interfaces are physical   interfaces.
If directory number and calling address differ from each other   or multiple directory numbers are being used,
the isdnDirectoryTable has to be used to enter such   directory numbers.
The recommended procedure for selecting a new index for isdnSignalingTable row creation is to GET the value of this object, and then to SET the object with the same value.

The ifIndex value of the interface associated with this signaling channel."
"The particular protocol type supported by the switch providing access to the ISDN network to which this signaling channel is connected."
"The ISDN Address to be assigned to this signaling channel.
More specifically, this is the 'Calling Address information element' as being passed to the switch in outgoing call setup messages.
It can be an EAZ (1TR6), a calling number (DSS1, ETSI) or any other number necessary to identify a signaling interface.
If there is no such number defined or required, this is a zero length string.
It is represented in DisplayString form.
Incoming calls can also be identified by this number.
If the Directory Number, i.e. the Called Number in incoming calls, is different to this number, the isdnDirectoryTable has to be used to specify all possible Directory Numbers.
The format of this information largely depends on the type of switch or PBX
the device is connected to.
Therefore, the detailed format of this information is not specified and is implementation dependent.
If possible, the agent should implement this information using the E.164 number format.
Otherwise, IA5 number digits must be used."

The Terminal Endpoint group and table
This table is required only if TEI values or SPID numbers   have to be entered.
The ifIndex values for this table are identical to those of   the isdnSignalingChannel table.
The recommended procedure for selecting a new index for isdnEndpointTable row creation is to GET the value of this object, and then to SET the object with the same value.
If the SET operation succeeds, the manager can use this value as an index to create a new row in this table."

"The type of TEI (Terminal Endpoint Identifier) used for this Terminal Endpoint.
In case of dynamic(1), the TEI value is selected by the switch.
In case of static(2), a valid TEI value has to be entered in the isdnEndpointTeiValue object.
The default value for this object depends on the interface type as well as the Terminal Endpoint type.
On Primary Rate interfaces the default value is static(2).
On Basic Rate interfaces the default value is dynamic(1) for isdn(63) Terminal Endpoints and static(2) for x25ple(40)
The TEI (Terminal Endpoint Identifier) value for this Terminal Endpoint.
If isdnEndpointTeiType is set to static(2), valid numbers are 0..63, while otherwise the value is set internally.
The default value of this object is 0 for static TEI assignment.
The default value for dynamic TEI assignment is also 0 as long as no TEI has been assigned.
After TEI assignment, the assigned TEI value is returned."
The Service profile IDentifier (SPID) information for this Terminal Endpoint.
The SPID is composed of 9 20 numeric characters.
This information has to be defined in addition to the local number for some switch protocol types, e.g. Bellcore NI 1 and NI 2.
If this object is not required, it is a zero length string.

Incoming calls are accepted on this signaling channel if the isdnDirectoryNumber is presented as Called Number in the SETUP message."
"This object is used to create and delete rows in the isdnDirectoryTable."
"This trap/inform is sent to the manager under the following condidions: on incoming calls for each call which is rejected for policy reasons (e.g. unknown neighbor or access violation) on outgoing calls whenever a call attempt is determined to have ultimately failed.
In the event that call retry is active, then this will be after all retry attempts have failed.
In this case, the object isdnBearerCallConnectTime should be included in the trap.
Only one such trap is sent in between successful or unsuccessful call attempts from or to a single neighbor; subsequent call attempts result in no trap.
If the Dial Control MIB objects dialCtlNbrCfgId
and dialCtlNbrCfgIndex are known by the entity generating this trap, both objects should be included in the trap as well.
The receipt of this trap with no dial neighbor information indicates that the manager must poll the callHistoryTable of the Dial Control MIB to see what changed."
