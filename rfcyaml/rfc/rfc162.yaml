  - "                              NETBUGGER3\n   NETBUGGER3 is a third level program\
    \ for the debugging of second and\n   third level programs, experimentation with\
    \ and simulation of third\n   level protocols.\n   We were writing an RJE FILENET\
    \ to interact with UCLA-CCN, and\n   discovered that they (UCLA-CCN) wouldn't\
    \ be up for a few months.  We\n   needed a program that would simulate CCN, so\
    \ that we could interact\n   with it and debug our FILENET.  It occurred to me\
    \ that all over the\n   network, people had similar problems, i.e., they couldn't\
    \ debug\n   programs because the intended server wasn't up.  And so I started\
    \ to\n   write a third level debugger-simulater.\n   With NETBUGGER3 the user\
    \ can easily issue RTSs, STRs, and LISTENs,\n   interrogate the status of connections,\
    \ receive and display NCP-USER\n   events and transmit and receive data over as\
    \ many as twelve\n   connections (per copy of program running).  Received data\
    \ can be\n   displayed in ASCII, EBCDIC on HEX.  The user can, of course,\n  \
    \ originate data for transmission in the same forms.  NETBUGGER3 can be\n   initiator,\
    \ receiver and/or intermediate in connections.\n   An example of how NETBUGGER3\
    \ could be of use to other hosts on the\n   Net follows.\n   Host X has a special\
    \ third level Filenet to debug.  The host they\n   plan to interact with won't\
    \ be up for several months.  Host X can\n   arrange with us to interact with NETBUGGER3,\
    \ which will simulate the\n   proposed third level protocol and transactions.\n\
    \   An alternate possibility is for Host X to use his Telnet to enter our\n  \
    \ system and start NETBUGGER3 himself.  He can then be running\n   NETBUGGER3\
    \ on one console and his filenet on another.\n   An alternate possibility is for\
    \ Host X to use his Telnet to enter our\n   system and start NETBUGGER3 himself.\
    \  He can then be running\n   NETBUGGER3 on one console and his filenet on another.\n\
    \   Then, later on when the other server Host is up, NETBUGGER3 can be\n   used\
    \ an intermediate between Host X and his serving host.  Every\n   message from\
    \ Host X to server and vice versa can be displayed,\n   examined and, if necessary,\
    \ edited as it passes through the\n   NETBUGGER3 console, thus making possible\
    \ the debugging and\n   measurements.\n   This is only one example.  If you are\
    \ interested in using, receiving,\n   documentation, making suggestions or anything\
    \ else regarding\n   NETBUGGER3, please contact the Network liaison at UCLA -\
    \ NMC.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n   \
