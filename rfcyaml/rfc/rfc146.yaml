    \            Views on Issues Relevant to Data Sharing\n                      \
    \    on Computer Networks\nIntroduction\nThe formation of a committee to address\
    \ the problems of achieving\ndata sharing on the ARPA Network, as suggested by\
    \ Arie Shoshani\n(RFC #140) is desirable at this point of network development.\
    \  We\nconcur with Shoshani's ideas (presented in an introductory paper\nto the\
    \ network data sharing meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, May 18)\nand believe that\
    \ purpose of the committee should be -\n        a) to classify the issues involved\
    \ and to propose various\n           approaches;\n        b) to integrate the\
    \ hitherto independent network activities\n           that address problems in\
    \ the area of data sharing, and;\n        c) to set up and coordinate appropriate\
    \ experiments to test\n           the services developed and to evaluate alternative\n\
    \           approaches.\nThis position paper is intended to augment Shoshani's\
    \ as a basis\nfor discussion at the data sharing meeting. No attempt is made\n\
    to discuss specific means of implementation since many approaches\nto data handling\
    \ problems are possible and have been proposed.\nRather, our viewpoint on what\
    \ the committee's role should be in\ngiving some cohesion to various existing\
    \ implementations is\npresented.\n    One approach to achieving data sharing on\
    \ the ARPA Network can\nbe thought of as having three stages, which roughly correspond\
    \ to\nthe modes of use or operation. Within each stage are various levels\nof\
    \ development required to get to the next stage. This development\nis not necessarily\
    \ sequential. A description of the three stages\nfollows.\nStage 1: Data handling\
    \ services are provided at various Hosts.\n         The user talks directly to\
    \ the serving Host (via TELNET\n         or by addressing a known socket) to explicitly\
    \ access\n         the service.  This mode of operation corresponds to\n     \
    \    Bhushan's category of \"direct\" usage (RFC #114).  The\n         data services\
    \ provided by the serving Host range from\n         simple ones, such as White's\
    \ file transfer system (RFC #122)\n         to sophisticated systems such as the\
    \ CCA's data machine\n         (NIC 5791 and 6706).\nStage 2: The user has access\
    \ to an intermediate process or data\n         control facility* that routes his\
    \ requests for a particular\n         data service to the serving system. The\
    \ user must explicitly\n         identify the data services to the used.  This\
    \ mode of\n         operation corresponds to Bhushan's category of \"indirect\"\
    \n         access. The data control facility provides the necessary\n        \
    \ control commands, data transformations, and accessing\n         methods. A single\
    \ request would include the use of several\n         interacting services. For\
    \ example, Heafner's Data\n         Reconfiguration Service (RFC #l38) could be\
    \ used in\n         conjunction with the use of CCA's data machine.\n_______________\n\
    *The data control facility is not necessarily located at his local\nHost. Such\
    \ a facility may exist on from one to all Host (i.e.,\nranging from centralized\
    \ to completely distributed).\n         etc. All references are by name. In this\
    \ mode of opera-\n         tion, the data control facility can function as a referral\n\
    \         center for data service requests by using the most ap-\n         propriate\
    \ data service available and by automatically\n         combining the use of several\
    \ services that may be needed\n         to satisfy a request.  For example, data\
    \ could be retrieved\n         from several files, each managed by a different\
    \ data\n         management system. The data control facility must be\n      \
    \   cognizant of the location of data files, their structure,\n         data management\
    \ system capabilities, etc.\nSome approaches to the design of the data control\
    \ facility have\nbeen suggested by Shoshani, notably the integrated data management\n\
    system (IDMS) and the unified data management system (UDMS). The\nnotion of the\
    \ network machine (RFC #51) is closest to the capabilities\none would see in Stage\
    \ 3.\nRelevant Areas of Development\nThe data control facility can range anywhere\
    \ from a simple inter-\nface to an intelligent front-end processor to a network-wide\
    \ re-\nferral system.  In any case, a common means is desirable for\nhandling\
    \ applications such as file transfer, on-line update and\nretrieval of data, information\
    \ gathering and reporting, and program\naccess to data. To attain this end, a\
    \ few of the areas in which\ndevelopments will be required include:\n     a) \
    \ a data description language, permitting the user to define\n         the physical\
    \ structure of files, to define logical files,\n         and to categorize data\
    \ fields for name referencing. The\n         language should be designed to facilitate\
    \ the resolution of\n         physical discrepancies in data and file structures.\
    \ The\n         user should be able to superimpose logical restructuring of\n\
    \         data without any change in the physical structure.\n         Shoshani's\
    \ suggested two-level approach with perhaps a\n         meta-language implementation\
    \ to facilitate conversions\n         among already existing languages.\n    \
    \ c)  methods for managing and merging distributed data, search\n         mechanisms\
    \ for file directories, error recovery techniques,\n         etc.\nIndependent\
    \ ARPA Network activities that in effect constitute\nStage 1 have touched on these\
    \ areas and should be incorporated into\nthe overall data sharing scheme such\
    \ that all of the isolated\npieces are compatible.  For example,\n      a) the\
    \ data reconfiguration service (RFC #138) would be\ninvoked by the data control\
    \ facility whenever data transformations\nare required.\n      b) the file transfer\
    \ protocol (RFC #114, #122)\nshould be consistent with other data handling services.\n\
    \      c) CCA's data machine should be a subset or part of any data\ncontrol facility.\
    \ The network data language and set of data\nmanagement services that they plan\
    \ to implement can perhaps be\nadopted network-wide.\n      d) the network machine\
    \ concept (RFC #51) for defining the pro-\ngram and data environments should be\
    \ resurrected. The data control\nfacility should be a subset of a network machine\
    \ architecture.\nSome other relevant topics include NIL (RFC #51), DEL (RFC 5),\
    \ the\nnotion Of MYLOCAL n, YOUR LOCAL n, and STANDARD n (RFC #42), user\nlevel\
    \ protocol objectives as described in RFC #76 and #91.\nAs data services are developed\
    \ on the network, a coordinated\neffort is desirable\n     a)  to exercise individual\
    \ implementations to see\n         if they work, both alone and in conjunction\
    \ with\n         other data services, and\n     b)  to evaluate alternative approaches.\n\
    Some examples of experimentation to test data services follow:\n     1.  File\
    \ Transfer Protocol\n         The file transfer protocol should be used to\n \
    \        manipulate data files controlled by various\n         systems.\n    \
    \ 2.  Data Transfer to Data Computer\n         The ability to transfer existing\
    \ data bases and\n         their structures onto the data computer should be\n\
    \         demonstrated.\n     3.  Data Restructuring\n         The ability to\
    \ define logical restructuring of\n         data for users needs which would be\
    \ accessible by\n         name should be demonstrated. The original physical\n\
    \         structure would be maintained.\n     4.  Data Transformation\n     \
    \    The ability to access various data management\n         systems on the network\
    \ without the user being\n         concerned with the data transformation involved\n\
    \         should be demonstrated. Necessary calls to forms\n         available\
    \ on the Data Reconfiguration Service\n         should be handled automatically\
    \ and should be\n         transparent to the user.\n         Problems of maintaining\
    \ consistency when duplicate\n         copies of a data file exist and updates\
    \ to the file\n         are made should be investigated. Automatic use of\n  \
    \       file transfer protocol and DRS to generate new\n         duplicate copies\
    \ should be included.\n     6.  Data Privacy\n         Access controls for privacy\
    \ Of data files in the\n         network environment should be designed and evaluated.\n\
    \         This includes controls on parts of distributed files.\nOur recommendation\
    \ is that the committee on data sharing be\nresponsible for coordinating development\
    \ in these areas, for\nattempting to maintain consistency among data services,\
    \ and for\ntesting services in a series of experiments as they are implemented.\n\
