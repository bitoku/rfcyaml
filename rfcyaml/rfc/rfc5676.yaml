  - "1.  Introduction\n   SNMP ([RFC3410], [RFC3411]) and SYSLOG [RFC5424] are two
    widely used\n   protocols to communicate event notifications.  Although co-existence\n
    \  of several management protocols in one operational environment is\n   possible,
    certain environments require that all event notifications\n   be collected by
    a single system daemon, such as a SYSLOG collector or\n   an SNMP notification
    receiver, via a single management protocol.  In\n   such environments, it is necessary
    to translate event notifications\n   between management protocols.\n   This document
    defines an SNMP MIB module to represent SYSLOG messages\n   and to send SYSLOG
    messages as SNMP notifications to SNMP\n   notification receivers.\n"

    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "4.  Overview\n   SYSLOG messages are translated to SNMP by a SYSLOG-to-SNMP\n
    \  translator.  Such a translator acts as a SYSLOG collector [RFC5424]\n   and
    implements a MIB module according to the SNMP architecture\n   [RFC3411].  The
    translator might be tightly coupled to an SNMP agent\n   or it might interface
    with an SNMP agent via a subagent protocol.\n   After initialization, the SYSLOG-to-SNMP
    translator will listen for\n   SYSLOG messages.  On receiving a message, the message
    will be parsed\n   to extract information as described in the MIB module.  A conceptual\n
    \  table is populated with information extracted from the SYSLOG\n   message,
    and finally a notification may be generated.\n   The MIB module is organized into
    a group of scalars and two tables.\n   The syslogMsgControl group contains two
    scalars controlling the\n   maximum size of SYSLOG messages recorded in the tables
    and also\n   controlling whether SNMP notifications are generated for SYSLOG\n
    \  messages.\n   --syslogMsgObjects(1)\n     |\n     +--syslogMsgControl(1)\n

    each recorded SYSLOG\n   message.  The basic fields of SYSLOG messages as well

  title: 4.  Overview

  - "5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules\n   The NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB [RFC3014]
    provides a generic mechanism for\n   logging SNMP notifications in order to deal
    with lost SNMP\n   notifications, e.g., due to transient communication problems.\n
    \  Applications can poll the notification log to verify that they have\n   not
    missed important SNMP notifications.\n   The MIB module defined in this memo provides
    a mechanism for logging\n   SYSLOG notifications.  This additional SYSLOG notification
    log is\n   provided because (a) SYSLOG messages might not lead to SNMP\n   notification
    (this is configurable) and (b) SNMP notifications might\n   not carry all information
    associated with a SYSLOG notification.\n   The MIB module IMPORTS objects from
    SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC\n   [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB
    [RFC3411], and\n   SYSLOG-TC-MIB [RFC5427].\n   The textual convention SyslogParamValueString
    uses the UTF-8\n   transformation format of the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character set
    defined\n   in [RFC3629].\n"
  title: 5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules
- contents:
  - "6.  Relationship to the SNMP Notification to SYSLOG Mapping\n   A companion document
    [RFC5675] defines a mapping of SNMP\n   notifications to SYSLOG messages.  This
    section discusses the\n   possibilities of using both specifications in combination.\n
    \  A SYSLOG collector implementing the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB module and the\n   mapping
    of SNMP notifications to SYSLOG messages may be configured to\n   translate received
    SYSLOG messages containing SNMP notifications back\n   into the original SNMP
    notification.  In this case, the relevant\n   tables of the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB will
    not be populated for SYSLOG\n   messages carrying SNMP notifications.  This configuration
    allows\n   operators to build a forwarding chain where SNMP notifications are\n
    \  \"tunneled\" through SYSLOG messages.  Due to size restrictions of the\n   SYSLOG
    transports and the more verbose textual encoding used by\n   SYSLOG, there is
    a possibility that SNMP notification content will\n   get truncated when tunneled
    through SYSLOG, and thus the resulting\n   SNMP notification may be incomplete.\n
    \  An SNMP management application supporting the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB and the\n   mapping
    of SNMP notifications to SYSLOG messages may process\n   information from the
    SYSLOG-MSG-MIB in order to emit a SYSLOG message\n   representing the SYSLOG message
    recorded in the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB\n   module.  This configuration allows operators
    to build a forwarding\n   chain where SYSLOG messages are \"tunneled\" through
    SNMP messages.  A\n   notification receiver can determine whether a syslogMsgNotification\n
    \  contained all structured data element parameters of a SYSLOG message.\n   In
    case parameters are missing, a forwarding application MUST\n   retrieve the missing
    parameters from the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB.  Regular\n   polling of the SYSLOG-MSG-MIB
    can be used to take care of any lost\n   SNMP notifications.\n"

  title: 9.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \  o  syslogMsgTableMaxSize: This object controls how many entries are\n      kept
    in the syslogMsgTable.  Unauthorized modifications may either\n      cause increased
    memory consumption (by setting this object to a\n      large value) or turn off
    the capability to retrieve notifications\n      using GET class operations (by
    setting this object to zero).  This\n      might be used to hide traces of an
    attack.\n   o  syslogMsgEnableNotifications: This object enables notifications.\n
    \     Unauthorized modifications to disable notification generation can\n      be
    used to hide an attack by preventing management applications\n      that use SNMP
    from receiving real-time notifications about events\n      carried in SYSLOG messages.
    \ Unauthorized modifications to enable\n      notification generation may be used
    as part of a denial-of-service\n      attack against a network management system
    if, for example, the\n      SYSLOG-to-SNMP translator accepts unauthorized SYSLOG
    messages.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with
    a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable
    in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or
    NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of
    these objects when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the
    tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  syslogMsgTableMaxSize,
    syslogMsgEnableNotifications: These objects\n      provide information regarding
    whether SYSLOG messages are\n      forwarded as SNMP notifications and how many
    messages will be\n      maintained in the syslogMsgTable.  This information might
    be\n      exploited by an attacker in order to plan actions with the goal of\n
    \     hiding attack activities.\n   o  syslogMsgFacility, syslogMsgSeverity, syslogMsgVersion,\n
    \     syslogMsgTimeStamp, syslogMsgHostName, syslogMsgAppName,\n      syslogMsgProcID,
    syslogMsgMsgID, syslogMsgSDParams, syslogMsgMsg,\n      syslogMsgSDParamValue:
    These objects carry the content of SYSLOG\n      messages and the SYSLOG-message-oriented
    security considerations\n      of [RFC5424] apply.  In particular, an attacker
    who gains access\n      to SYSLOG messages via SNMP may use the knowledge gained
    from\n      SYSLOG messages to compromise a machine or do other damage.  It is\n
    \     therefore desirable to configure SNMP access control rules,\n      enforcing
    a consistent security policy for SYSLOG messages.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3
    did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for
    example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure
    network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n
    \  in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security
    features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n
    \  including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication
    and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n
    \  RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable
    cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to
    ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module
    is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals
    (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
    them.\n   Using the security features of the SNMPv3 framework secures the\n   transport
    of SYSLOG data via SNMP only.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED\n   that deployments
