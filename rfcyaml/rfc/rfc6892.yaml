- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This specification defines the 'describes' link relation type that\n\
    \   allows resource representations to indicate that they are describing\n   another\
    \ resource.  In contexts where applications want to associate\n   described resources\
    \ and description resources, and want to build\n   services based on these associations,\
    \ the 'describes' link relation\n   type provides the opposite direction of the\
    \ 'describedby' link\n   relation type, which already is a registered link relation\
    \ type.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Resources on the web can be identified by any (registered)\
    \ URI scheme\n   and can be represented by any (registered) media type.  In many\n\
    \   cases, applications establish specific (i.e., typed) relations\n   between\
    \ the resources they are concerned with, which can either be\n   under their control\
    \ or controlled by another authority.  A common\n   usage pattern for associating\
    \ resources is to have resources that are\n   descriptions of other resources.\
    \  This specification registers the\n   'describes' link relation, which allows\
    \ applications to represent the\n   fact that one resource is a description of\
    \ another resource.\n   RFC 5988 [1] \"defines a framework for typed links that\
    \ isn't specific\n   to a particular serialisation or application.  It does so\
    \ by\n   redefining the link relation registry established by Atom to have a\n\
    \   broader domain, and adding to it the relations that are defined by\n   HTML\"\
    .  This registration request intends to augment the link\n   relation registry\
    \ with a link relation that is the inverse of the\n   already registered 'describedby'\
    \ relation, so that links between\n   described resources and describing resources\
    \ can be represented in\n   both directions.\n"
- title: 2.  Resource Descriptions
  contents:
  - "2.  Resource Descriptions\n   Associating resources with descriptions of these\
    \ resources is a\n   recurring pattern on the web.  The IANA \"Link Relations\"\
    \ registry\n   established by RFC 5988 [1] currently contains a 'describedby'\
    \ link\n   relation type, which has been registered by POWDER [2].  The\n   definition\
    \ given in the reference document for that registration is\n   as follows: \"\
    The relationship A 'describedby' B asserts that resource\n   B provides a description\
    \ of resource A.  There are no constraints on\n   the format or representation\
    \ of either A or B, neither are there any\n   further constraints on either resource\"\
    .\n   Since many scenarios using resource descriptions need to represent\n   the\
    \ fact that some resource describes another resource (the opposite\n   of the\
    \ 'describedby' relation), this document registers a 'describes'\n   link relation\
    \ type.  Establishing a link A 'describes' B asserts that\n   the resource identified\
    \ by A is a description of the resource\n   identified by B, without constraining\
    \ in any way the identifiers\n   being used for A and B, and the media types for\
    \ the representations\n   being provided when those identifiers are dereferenced.\n\
    \   Specifically, it is possible that identifiers A and/or B have no\n   associated\
    \ interaction method (they could be URNs, for example), but\n   it still is valid\
    \ to establish the A 'describes' B link.\n   Another design freedom is to use\
    \ \"chains\" of 'describes' (or\n   'describedby') links, so that one resource\
    \ is a description of\n   another resource, which in turn is a description of\
    \ yet another\n   resource.  The \"levels\" of descriptions can go as deep as\
    \ required by\n   an application and are not constrained by this specification.\n"
- title: 3.  Use Case
  contents:
  - "3.  Use Case\n   Beginning with the POWDER document [2], which specifies the\n\
    \   'describedby' link relation, the use case for the 'describedby' link\n   relation\
    \ is that a described resource, such as an HTML web page, can\n   specify a link\
    \ where clients can find a description of this resource.\n   While the 'describedby'\
    \ link relation is defined to be independent of\n   specific formats and representations,\
    \ within the context of POWDER,\n   the assumption is that the linked resources\
    \ most often will provide a\n   description based on the Resource Description\
    \ Framework (RDF), for\n   example, to provide metadata about a document's author\
    \ and other\n   provenance information.\n   The 'describes' link relation allows\
    \ servers hosting description\n   resources to associate those description resources\
    \ with the resources\n   that they are describing.  In the RDF-oriented scenario\
    \ of POWDER,\n   this means that a service managing description resources would\
    \ use\n   'describes' links to represent the fact that the description\n   resources\
    \ it exposes provide some description of the described\n   resource, very likely\
    \ in some RDF representation.  However, since\n   link relations are independent\
    \ of resource formats or\n   representations, such an association could also be\
    \ made in other\n   formats such as XML or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON),\
    \ allowing\n   servers to use a single and consistent link relation to associate\n\
    \   description resources with described resources.\n   Generally speaking, the\
    \ idea of the 'describes' relation is the same\n   as the idea of the 'describedby'\
    \ relation; to be independent of\n   specific formats and representations of both\
    \ described resources and\n   description resources.  The 'describes' link relation\
    \ (together with\n   the already registered 'describedby' link relation) thus\
    \ serves as a\n   general foundation of how described resources and description\n\
    \   resources can be associated.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   The link relation type below has been registered\
    \ by IANA per Section\n   6.2.1 of RFC 5988 [1]:\n      Relation Name: describes\n\
    \      Description: The relationship A 'describes' B asserts that\n      resource\
    \ A provides a description of resource B.  There are no\n      constraints on\
    \ the format or representation of either A or B,\n      neither are there any\
    \ further constraints on either resource.\n      Reference: [RFC6892]\n      Notes:\
    \ This link relation type is the inverse of the 'describedby'\n      relation\
    \ type.  While 'describedby' establishes a relation from\n      the described\
    \ resource back to the resource that describes it,\n      'describes' established\
    \ a relation from the describing resource to\n      the resource it describes.\
    \  If B is 'describedby' A, then A\n      'describes' B.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Resource descriptions should never be treated\
    \ as authoritative or\n   exclusive without relying on additional mechanisms for\
    \ trust and\n   security.  Resources can have many (possibly conflicting)\n  \
    \ descriptions, and the 'describes' link relation type makes no claim\n   whatsoever\
    \ about the authority of the party providing the association\n   between the two\
    \ resources, or about the authority of the party\n   providing the description\
    \ resource.  Before making any assumptions\n   about the authority of the description\
    \ resource (both the accuracy of\n   the description contained in the description\
    \ resource, and the\n   authority to provide a description of the described resource),\n\
    \   clients need a context that allows them to understand both the\n   authority\
    \ of the description itself, and the authority to establish\n   the 'describes'\
    \ relation.  Nobody can stop clients from providing\n   misleading unauthorized\
    \ and/or descriptions, and clients need to have\n   both a security and trust\
    \ framework to allow them to choose between\n   trusted and untrusted descriptions.\n"
