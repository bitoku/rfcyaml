  - "1.  Introduction\n   SPF [RFC7208], DKIM [RFC6376], and DMARC [RFC7489] enable
    a domain\n   owner to publish email authentication and policy information in the\n
    \  DNS.  SPF primarily publishes information about what host addresses\n   are
    authorized to send mail for a domain.  DKIM places cryptographic\n   signatures
    on email messages, with the validation keys published in\n   the DNS.  DMARC publishes
    policy information related to the domain in\n   the From: header field of email
    messages.\n   In conventional email, all domain names are ASCII in all contexts,
    so\n   there is no question about the representation of the domain names.\n   All
    internationalized domain names are represented as A-labels\n   [RFC5890] in message
    header fields, SMTP sessions, and the DNS.\n   Internationalized mail [RFC6530]
    (generally called \"EAI\" for Email\n   Address Internationalization) allows U-labels
    in SMTP sessions\n   [RFC6531] and message header fields [RFC6532].\n   Every
    U-label is equivalent to an A-label, so in principle, the\n   choice of label
    format will not cause ambiguities.  But in practice,\n   consistent use of label
    formats will make it more likely that code\n   for mail senders and receivers
    interoperates.\n   Internationalized mail also allows UTF-8-encoded Unicode characters\n
    \  in the local parts of mailbox names, which were historically only\n   ASCII.\n"

  - "2.  Definitions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described
    in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals,
    as shown here.\n   The term \"IDN\", for Internationalized Domain Name, refers
    to a domain\n   name containing either U-labels or A-labels.\n   Since DMARC is
    not currently a Standards Track protocol, this\n   specification offers advice
    rather than requirements for DMARC.\n"

  - "3.  General Principles\n   In headers in EAI mail messages, domain names that
    were restricted to\n   ASCII can be U-labels, and mailbox local parts can be UTF-8.
    \ Header\n   field names and other text intended primarily to be interpreted by\n
    \  computers rather than read by people remains ASCII.\n   Strings stored in DNS
    records remain ASCII since there is no way to\n   tell whether a client retrieving
    a DNS record expects an EAI or an\n   ASCII result.  When a domain name found
    in a mail header field\n   includes U-labels, those labels are translated to A-labels
    before\n   being looked up in the DNS, as described in [RFC5891].\n"
  title: 3.  General Principles
- contents:
  - "4.  SPF and Internationalized Mail\n   SPF [RFC7208] uses two identities from
    the SMTP session: the host\n   name in the EHLO command and the domain in the
    address in the MAIL\n   FROM command.  Since the EHLO command precedes the server
    response\n   that tells whether the server supports the SMTPUTF8 extension, an
    IDN\n   host name MUST be represented as A-labels.  An IDN in MAIL FROM can\n
    \  be either U-labels or A-labels.\n   All U-labels MUST be converted to A-labels
    before being used for an\n   SPF validation.  This includes both the labels in
    the name used for\n   the original DNS lookup, described in Section 3 of [RFC7208],
    and\n   those used in the macro expansion of domain-spec, described in\n   Section
    7.  Section 4.3 of [RFC7208] states that all IDNs in an SPF\n   DNS record MUST
    be A-labels; this rule is unchanged since any SPF\n   record can be used to authorize
    either EAI or conventional mail.\n   SPF macros %{s} and %{l} expand the local
    part of the sender's\n   mailbox.  If the local part contains non-ASCII characters,
    terms that\n   include %{s} or %{l} do not match anything, because non-ASCII local\n
    \  parts cannot be used as the DNS labels the macros are intended to\n   match.
    \ Since these macros are rarely used, this is unlikely to be an\n   issue in practice.\n"

- contents:
  - "5.  DKIM and Internationalized Mail\n   DKIM [RFC6376] specifies a mail header
    field that contains a\n   cryptographic message signature and a DNS record that
    contains the\n   validation key.\n   Section 2.11 of [RFC6376] defines dkim-quoted-printable.
    \ Its\n   definition is modified in messages with internationalized header\n   fields
    so that non-ASCII UTF-8 characters need not be quoted.  The\n   ABNF [RFC5234]
    for dkim-safe-char in those messages is replaced by\n   the following, adding
    non-ASCII UTF-8 characters from [RFC3629]:\n   dkim-safe-char        =  %x21-3A
    / %x3C / %x3E-7E /\n                                       UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4\n
    \                           ; '!' - ':', '<', '>' - '~', non-ASCII\n   UTF8-2
    \               = <Defined in Section 4 of RFC 3629>\n   UTF8-3                =
    <Defined in Section 4 of RFC 3629>\n   UTF8-4                = <Defined in Section
    4 of RFC 3629>\n   Section 3.5 of [RFC6376] states that IDNs in the d=, i=, and
    s= tags\n   of a DKIM-Signature header field MUST be encoded as A-labels.  This\n
    \  rule is relaxed only for internationalized message header fields\n   [RFC6532],
    so IDNs SHOULD be represented as U-labels.  This provides\n   improved consistency
    with other header fields.  (A-labels remain\n   valid to allow a transition from
    older software.)  The set of\n   allowable characters in the local part of an
    i= tag is extended in\n   the same fashion as local parts of email addresses as
    described in\n   Section 3.2 of [RFC6532].  When computing or verifying the hash
    in a\n   DKIM signature as described in Section 3.7 of [RFC6376], the hash\n   MUST
    use the domain name in the format it occurs in the header field.\n   Section 3.4.2
    of [RFC6376] describes relaxed header canonicalization.\n   Its first step converts
    all header field names from uppercase to\n   lowercase.  Field names are restricted
    to printable ASCII (see\n   [RFC5322], Section 3.6.8), so this case conversion
    remains ASCII case\n   conversion.\n   DKIM key records, described in Section
    3.6.1 of [RFC6376], do not\n   contain domain names, so there is no change to
    their specification.\n"

  - "6.  DMARC and Internationalized Mail\n   DMARC [RFC7489] defines a policy language
    that domain owners can\n   specify for the domain of the address in an RFC5322.From
    header\n   field.\n   Section 6.6.1 of [RFC7489] specifies, somewhat imprecisely,
    how IDNs\n   in the RFC5322.From address domain are to be handled.  That section\n
    \  is updated to say that all U-labels in the domain are converted to\n   A-labels
    before further processing.  Section 7.1 of [RFC7489] is\n   similarly updated
    to say that all U-labels in domains being handled\n   are converted to A-labels
    before further processing.\n   DMARC policy records, described in Sections 6.3
    and 7.1 of [RFC7489],\n   can contain email addresses in the \"rua\" and \"ruf\"
    tags.  Since a\n   policy record can be used for both internationalized and conventional\n
    \  mail, those addresses still have to be conventional addresses, not\n   internationalized
    addresses.\n"

    abuses.  This\n   document attempts to slightly mitigate some of them but does
    not, as\n   far as the author knows, add any new ones.  The updates to SPF, DKIM,\n
    \  and DMARC are intended to allow the respective specifications to work\n   as
    reliably on internationalized mail as they do on ASCII mail, so\n   that applications
    that use them, such as some kinds of mail filters\n   that catch spam and phish,
    can work more reliably on\n   internationalized mail.\n"
