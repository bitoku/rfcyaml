- title: 1.  The Standardization Process
  contents:
  - "1.  The Standardization Process\n   The Internet Activities Board maintains this\
    \ list of documents that\n   define standards for the Internet protocol suite\
    \ (see RFC-1160 for an\n   explanation of the role and organization of the IAB\
    \ and its\n   subsidiary groups, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and\
    \ the\n   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)).  The IAB provides these\n   standards\
    \ with the goal of co-ordinating the evolution of the\n   Internet protocols;\
    \ this co-ordination has become quite important as\n   the Internet protocols\
    \ are increasingly in general commercial use.\n   The majority of Internet protocol\
    \ development and standardization\n   activity takes place in the working groups\
    \ of the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force.\n   Protocols which are to become\
    \ standards in the Internet go through a\n   series of states (proposed standard,\
    \ draft standard, and standard)\n   involving increasing amounts of scrutiny and\
    \ experimental testing.\n   At each step, the Internet Engineering Steering Group\
    \ (IESG) of the\n   IETF must make a recommendation for advancement of the protocol\
    \ and\n   the IAB must ratify it.  If a recommendation is not ratified, the\n\
    \   protocol is remanded to the IETF for further work.\n   To allow time for the\
    \ Internet community to consider and react to\n   standardization proposals, the\
    \ IAB imposes a minimum delay of 4\n   months before a proposed standard can be\
    \ advanced to a draft standard\n   and 6 months before a draft standard can be\
    \ promoted to standard.\n   It is general IAB practice that no proposed standard\
    \ can be promoted\n   to draft standard without at least two independent implementations\n\
    \   (and the recommendation of the IESG).  Promotion from draft standard\n   to\
    \ standard generally requires operational experience and\n   demonstrated interoperability\
    \ of two or more implementations (and the\n   recommendation of the IESG).\n \
    \  In cases where there is uncertainty as to the proper decision\n   concerning\
    \ a protocol the IAB may convene a special review committee\n   consisting of\
    \ experts from the IETF, IRTF and the IAB with the\n   purpose of recommending\
    \ an explicit action to the IAB.\n   Advancement of a protocol to proposed standard\
    \ is an important step\n   since it marks a protocol as a candidate for eventual\
    \ standardization\n   (it puts the protocol \"on the standards track\").  Advancement\
    \ to\n   draft standard is a major step which warns the community that, unless\n\
    \   major objections are raised or flaws are discovered, the protocol is\n   likely\
    \ to be advanced to standard in six months.\n   Some protocols have been superseded\
    \ by better ones or are otherwise\n   unused.  Such protocols are still documented\
    \ in this memorandum with\n   the designation \"historic\".\n   Because the IAB\
    \ believes it is useful to document the results of\n   early protocol research\
    \ and development work, some of the RFCs\n   document protocols which are still\
    \ in an experimental condition.  The\n   protocols are designated \"experimental\"\
    \ in this memorandum.  They\n   appear in this report as a convenience to the\
    \ community and not as\n   evidence of their standardization.\n   Other protocols,\
    \ such as those developed by other standards\n   organizations, or by particular\
    \ vendors, may be of interest or may be\n   recommended for use in the Internet.\
    \  The specifications of such\n   protocols may be published as RFCs for the convenience\
    \ of the\n   Internet community.  These protocols are labeled \"informational\"\
    \ in\n   this memorandum.\n   In addition to the working groups of the IETF, protocol\
    \ development\n   and experimentation may take place as a result of the work of\
    \ the\n   research groups of the Internet Research Task Force, or the work of\n\
    \   other individuals interested in Internet protocol development.  The\n   IAB\
    \ encourages the documentation of such experimental work in the RFC\n   series,\
    \ but none of this work is considered to be on the track for\n   standardization\
    \ until the IESG has made a recommendation to advance\n   the protocol to the\
    \ proposed standard state, and the IAB has approved\n   this step.\n   A few protocols\
    \ have achieved widespread implementation without the\n   approval of the IESG\
    \ and the IAB.  For example, some vendor protocols\n   have become very important\
    \ to the Internet community even though they\n   have not been recommended by\
    \ the IESG or ratified by the IAB.\n   However, the IAB strongly recommends that\
    \ the IAB standards process\n   be used in the evolution of the protocol suite\
    \ to maximize\n   interoperability (and to prevent incompatible protocol requirements\n\
    \   from arising).  The IAB reserves the use of the terms \"standard\",\n   \"\
    draft standard\", and \"proposed standard\" in any RFC or other\n   publication\
    \ of Internet protocols to only those protocols which the\n   IAB has approved.\n\
    \   In addition to a state (like \"Proposed Standard\"), a protocol is also\n\
    \   assigned a status, or requirement level, in this document.  The\n   possible\
    \ requirement levels (\"Required\", \"Recommended\", \"Elective\",\n   \"Limited\
    \ Use\", and \"Not Recommended\") are defined in Section 4.2.\n   When a protocol\
    \ is on the standards track, that is in the proposed\n   standard, draft standard,\
    \ or standard state (see Section 5), the\n   status shown in Section 6 is the\
    \ current status.  For a proposed or\n   draft standard, however, the IAB will\
    \ also endeavor to indicate the\n   eventual status this protocol will have after\
    \ adoption as a standard.\n   Few protocols are required to be implemented in\
    \ all systems; this is\n   because there is such a variety of possible systems,\
    \ for example,\n   gateways, terminal servers, workstations, and multi-user hosts.\
    \  The\n   requirement level shown in this document is only a one word label,\n\
    \   which may not be sufficient to characterize the implementation\n   requirements\
    \ for a protocol in all situations.  For some protocols,\n   this document contains\
    \ an additional status paragraph.  In addition,\n   more detailed status information\
    \ is contained in separate\n   requirements documents (see Section 3).\n"
- title: 2.  The Request for Comments Documents
  contents:
  - "2.  The Request for Comments Documents\n   The documents called Request for Comments\
    \ (or RFCs) are the working\n   notes of the \"Network Working Group\", that is\
    \ the Internet research\n   and development community.  A document in this series\
    \ may be on\n   essentially any topic related to computer communication, and may\
    \ be\n   anything from a meeting report to the specification of a standard.\n\
    \   Notice:\n      All standards are published as RFCs, but not all RFCs specify\n\
    \      standards.\n   Anyone can submit a document for publication as an RFC.\
    \  Submissions\n   must be made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor (see the\
    \ contact\n   information at the end of this memo).\n   While RFCs are not refereed\
    \ publications, they do receive technical\n   review from the task forces, individual\
    \ technical experts, or the RFC\n   Editor, as appropriate.\n   The RFC series\
    \ comprises a wide range of documents, ranging from\n   informational documents\
    \ of general interests to specifications of\n   standard Internet protocols. \
    \ In cases where submission is intended\n   to document a proposed standard, draft\
    \ standard, or standard\n   protocol, the RFC Editor will publish the document\
    \ only with the\n   approval of both the IESG and the IAB.  For documents describing\n\
    \   experimental work, the RFC Editor will notify the IESG before\n   publication,\
    \ allowing for the possibility of review by the relevant\n   IETF working group\
    \ or IRTF research group and provide those comments\n   to the author.  See Section\
    \ 5.1 for more detail.\n   Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published,\
    \ that RFC is\n   never revised or re-issued with the same number.  There is never\
    \ a\n   question of having the most recent version of a particular RFC.\n   However,\
    \ a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may be\n   improved and re-documented\
    \ many times in several different RFCs.  It\n   is important to verify that you\
    \ have the most recent RFC on a\n   particular protocol.  This \"IAB Official\
    \ Protocol Standards\" memo is\n   the reference for determining the correct RFC\
    \ for the current\n   specification of each protocol.\n   The RFCs are available\
    \ from the Network Information Center at SRI\n   International, and a number of\
    \ other sites.  For more information\n   about obtaining RFCs, see Sections 7.4\
    \ and 7.5.\n"
- title: 3.  Other Reference Documents
  contents:
  - "3.  Other Reference Documents\n   There are four other reference documents of\
    \ interest in checking the\n   current status of protocol specifications and standardization.\
    \  These\n   are the Assigned Numbers, the Annotated Internet Protocols, the\n\
    \   Gateway Requirements, and the Host Requirements.  Note that these\n   documents\
    \ are revised and updated at different times; in case of\n   differences between\
    \ these documents, the most recent must prevail.\n   Also, one should be aware\
    \ of the MIL-STD publications on IP, TCP,\n   Telnet, FTP, and SMTP.  These are\
    \ described in Section 3.5.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Assigned Numbers
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Assigned Numbers\n   This document lists the assigned values of the parameters\
    \ used in the\n   various protocols.  For example, IP protocol codes, TCP port\
    \ numbers,\n   Telnet Option Codes, ARP hardware types, and Terminal Type names.\n\
    \   Assigned Numbers was most recently issued as RFC-1060.\n   Another document,\
    \ Internet Numbers, lists the assigned IP network\n   numbers, and the autonomous\
    \ system numbers.  Internet Numbers was\n   most recently issued as RFC-1166.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Annotated Internet Protocols
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Annotated Internet Protocols\n   This document lists the protocols and\

- title: 3.3.  Gateway Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Gateway Requirements\n   This document reviews the specifications that\
    \ apply to gateways and\n   supplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities.\

    \   preparing a revision.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Host Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Host Requirements\n   This pair of documents reviews and updates the specifications\
    \ that\n   apply to hosts, and it supplies guidance and clarification for any\n\

  contents:
  - "3.5.  The MIL-STD Documents\n   The Internet community specifications for IP\
    \ (RFC-791) and TCP (RFC-\n   793) and the DoD MIL-STD specifications are intended\
    \ to describe\n   exactly the same protocols.  Any difference in the protocols\n\
    \   specified by these sets of documents should be reported to DCA and to\n  \
    \ the IAB.  The RFCs and the MIL-STDs for IP and TCP differ in style\n   and level\
    \ of detail.  It is strongly advised that the two sets of\n   documents be used\
    \ together, along with RFC-1122.\n   The IAB and the DoD MIL-STD specifications\
    \ for the FTP, SMTP, and\n   Telnet protocols are essentially the same documents\
    \ (RFCs 765, 821,\n   854).  The MIL-STD versions have been edited slightly. \

- title: 4.  Explanation of Terms
  contents:
  - "4.  Explanation of Terms\n   There are two independent categorization of protocols.\
    \  The first is\n   the STATE of standardization, one of \"standard\", \"draft\
    \ standard\",\n   \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\", \"informational\" or\
    \ \"historic\".\n   The second is the STATUS of this protocol, one of \"required\"\
    ,\n   \"recommended\", \"elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".\n\
    \   The status or requirement level is difficult to portray in a one word\n  \
    \ label.  These status labels should be considered only as an\n   indication,\
    \ and a further description, or applicability statement,\n   should be consulted.\n\
    \   When a protocol is advanced to proposed standard or draft standard,\n   it\
    \ is labeled with a current status and when possible, the IAB also\n   notes the\
    \ status that the protocol is expected to have when it\n   reaches the standard\
    \ state.\n   At any given time a protocol occupies a cell of the following matrix.\n\
    \   Protocols are likely to be in cells in about the following\n   proportions\
    \ (indicated by the relative number of Xs).  A new protocol\n   is most likely\
    \ to start in the (proposed standard, elective) cell, or\n   the (experimental,\

    \   What is a \"system\"?\n      Some protocols are particular to hosts and some\
    \ to gateways; a few\n      protocols are used in both.  The definitions of the\
    \ terms below\n      will refer to a \"system\" which is either a host or a gateway\
    \ (or\n      both).  It should be clear from the context of the particular\n \

    \  Comments and test results should be submitted to the\n      IAB.  There is\
    \ a possibility that changes will be made in a Draft\n      Standard Protocol\
    \ before it becomes a Standard Protocol.\n   4.1.3.  Proposed Standard Protocol\n\
    \      These are protocol proposals that may be considered by the IAB for\n  \
    \    standardization in the future.  Implementation and testing by\n      several\
    \ groups is desirable.  Revision of the protocol\n      specification is likely.\n\
    \   4.1.4.  Experimental Protocol\n      A system should not implement an experimental\
    \ protocol unless it\n      is participating in the experiment and has coordinated\
    \ its use of\n      the protocol with the developer of the protocol.\n      Typically,\
    \ experimental protocols are those that are developed as\n      part of an ongoing\
    \ research project not related to an operational\n      service offering.  While\
    \ they may be proposed as a service\n      protocol at a later stage, and thus\
    \ become proposed standard,\n      draft standard, and then standard protocols,\
    \ the designation of a\n      protocol as experimental may sometimes be meant\
    \ to suggest that\n      the protocol, although perhaps mature, is not intended\
    \ for\n      operational use.\n   4.1.5.  Informational Protocol\n      Protocols\
    \ developed by other standard organizations, or vendors,\n      or that are for\
    \ other reasons outside the purview of the IAB, may\n      be published as RFCs\
    \ for the convenience of the Internet community\n      as informational protocols.\
    \  Such protocols may in some cases also\n      be recommended for use in the\
    \ Internet by the IAB.\n   4.1.6.  Historic Protocol\n      These are protocols\
    \ that are unlikely to ever become standards in\n      the Internet either because\
    \ they have been superseded by later\n      developments or due to lack of interest.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Definitions of Protocol Status
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Definitions of Protocol Status\n      This document lists a STATUS for\
    \ each protocol.  The status is one\n      of \"required\", \"recommended\", \"\
    elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not\n      recommended\".\n   4.2.1.  Required\
    \ Protocol\n      A system must implement the required protocols.\n   4.2.2. \
    \ Recommended Protocol\n      A system should implement the recommended protocols.\n\
    \   4.2.3.  Elective Protocol\n      A system may or may not implement an elective\
    \ protocol. The\n      general notion is that if you are going to do something\
    \ like this,\n      you must do exactly this.  There may be several elective protocols\n\
    \      in a general area, for example, there are several electronic mail\n   \
    \   protocols, and several routing protocols.\n   4.2.4.  Limited Use Protocol\n\
    \      These protocols are for use in limited circumstances.  This may be\n  \
    \    because of their experimental state, specialized nature, limited\n      functionality,\
    \ or historic state.\n   4.2.5.  Not Recommended Protocol\n      These protocols\
    \ are not recommended for general use.  This may be\n      because of their limited\
    \ functionality, specialized nature, or\n      experimental or historic state.\n"

- title: 5.2.  The Standards Track Diagram
  contents:
  - "5.2.  The Standards Track Diagram\n   There is a part of the STATUS and STATE\
    \ categorization that is called\n   the standards track.  Actually, only the changes\
    \ of state are\n   significant to the progression along the standards track, though\
    \ the\n   status assignments may be changed as well.\n   The states illustrated\
    \ by single line boxes are temporary states,\n   those illustrated by double line\
    \ boxes are long term states.  A\n   protocol will normally be expected to remain\
    \ in a temporary state for\n   several months (minimum four months for proposed\
    \ standard, minimum\n   six months for draft standard).  A protocol may be in\
    \ a long term\n   state for many years.\n   A protocol may enter the standards\
    \ track only on the recommendation\n   of the IESG and by action of the IAB; and\
    \ may move from one state to\n   another along the track only on the recommendation\
    \ of the IESG and by\n   action of the IAB.  That is, it takes both the IESG and\
    \ the IAB to\n   either start a protocol on the track or to move it along.\n \
    \  Generally, as the protocol enters the standards track a decision is\n   made\
    \ as to the eventual STATUS (elective, recommended, or required)\n   the protocol\
    \ will have, although a somewhat less stringent current\n   status may be assigned,\
    \ and it then is placed in the the proposed\n   standard STATE with that status.\
    \  So the initial placement of a\n   protocol is into state 1.  At any time the\
    \ STATUS decision may be\n   revisited.\n         |\n         +<----------------------------------------------+\n\

    \ state (4).\n   This is off the standards track, and the protocol may be resubmitted\n\
    \   to enter the standards track after further work.  There are other\n   paths\
    \ into the experimental and historic states that do not involve\n   IAB action.\n\

  - "Notes:\n   IGMP -- The Internet Activities Board intends to move towards general\n\
    \   adoption of IP multicasting, as a more efficient solution than\n   broadcasting\
    \ for many applications.  The host interface has been\n   standardized in RFC-1112;\
    \ however, multicast-routing gateways are in\n   the experimental stage and are\
    \ not widely available.  An Internet\n   host should support all of RFC-1112,\
    \ except for the IGMP protocol\n   itself which is optional; see RFC-1122 for\
    \ more details.  Even\n   without IGMP, implementation of RFC-1112 will provide\
    \ an important\n   advance: IP-layer access to local network multicast addressing.\
    \  It\n   is expected that IGMP will become recommended for all hosts and\n  \
    \ gateways at some future date.\n   SMI, MIB, SNMP -- The Internet Activities\
    \ Board recommends that all\n   IP and TCP implementations be network manageable.\
    \  At the current\n   time, this implies implementation of the Internet MIB (RFC-1156),\
    \ the\n   MIB extension MIB-II (RFC-1158, a Draft Standard), and at least the\n\
    \   recommended management protocol SNMP (RFC-1157).\n"

  - "Notes:\n   RIP -- The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is widely implemented\n\
    \   and used in the Internet.  However, both implementors and users\n   should\
    \ be aware that RIP has some serious technical limitations as a\n   routing protocol.\
    \  The IETF is currently developing several\n   candidates for a new standard\
    \ \"open\" routing protocol with better\n   properties than RIP.  The IAB urges\
    \ the Internet community to track\n   these developments, and to implement the\
    \ new protocol when it is\n   standardized; improved Internet service will result\
    \ for many users.\n   TP-TCP -- As OSI protocols become more widely implemented\
    \ and used,\n   there will be an increasing need to support interoperation with\
    \ the\n   TCP/IP protocols.  The Internet Engineering Task Force is formulating\n\
    \   strategies for interoperation.  RFC-1006 provides one interoperation\n   mode,\
    \ in which TCP/IP is used to emulate TP0 in order to support OSI\n   applications.\
    \  Hosts that wish to run OSI connection-oriented\n   applications in this mode\
    \ should use the procedure described in RFC-\n   1006.  In the future, the IAB\
    \ expects that a major portion of the\n   Internet will support both TCP/IP and\
    \ OSI (inter-)network protocols\n   in parallel, and it will then be possible\
    \ to run OSI applications\n   across the Internet using full OSI protocol \"stacks\"\
    .\n   MIB-II -- This memo defines a mandatory extension to the base MIB\n   (RFC-1156)\
    \ and is a Draft Standard for the Internet community.  The\n   extensions described\
    \ here are currently Elective, but when they\n   become a standard, they will\
    \ have the same status as RFC-1156, that\n   is, Recommended.  See also the note\
    \ on SMI, MIB and SNMP under\n   Standards.\n   PPP -- Point to Point Protocol\
    \ is a method of sending IP over serial\n   lines, which are a type of physical\
    \ network.  It is anticipated that\n   PPP will be advanced to the network-specific\
    \ standard protocol state\n   in the future.\n"
