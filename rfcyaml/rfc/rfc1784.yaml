- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file\n\
    \   transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a\n   remote\
    \ host.\n   This document describes two TFTP options. The first allows the client\n\
    \   and server to negotiate the Timeout Interval.  The second allows the\n   side\
    \ receiving the file to determine the ultimate size of the\n   transfer before\
    \ it begins.  The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is\n   described in [2].\n \
    \  This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the\n   terminology\
    \ and notation of both [1] and [2].\n"
- title: Timeout Interval Option Specification
  contents:
  - "Timeout Interval Option Specification\n   The TFTP Read Request or Write Request\
    \ packet is modified to include\n   the timeout option as follows:\n      |  opc\
    \  |filename| 0 |  mode  | 0 | timeout| 0 |  #secs | 0 |\n      opc\n        \
    \ The opcode field contains either a 1, for Read Requests, or 2,\n         for\
    \ Write Requests, as defined in [1].\n      filename\n         The name of the\
    \ file to be read or written, as defined in [1].\n         This is a NULL-terminated\
    \ field.\n      mode\n         The mode of the file transfer: \"netascii\", \"\
    octet\", or \"mail\",\n         as defined in [1].  This is a NULL-terminated\
    \ field.\n      timeout\n         The Timeout Interval option, \"timeout\" (case\
    \ insensitive).\n         This is a NULL-terminated field.\n      #secs\n    \
    \     The number of seconds to wait before retransmitting, specified\n       \
    \  in ASCII.  Valid values range between \"1\" and \"255\" octets,\n         inclusive.\
    \  This is a NULL-terminated field.\n   For example:\n      +-------+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+\n\
    \      |   1   | foobar | 0 | binary | 0 | timeout| 0 |    1   | 0 |\n      +-------+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+\n\
    \   is a Read Request, for the file named \"foobar\", in binary transfer\n   mode,\
    \ with a timeout interval of 1 second.\n   If the server is willing to accept\
    \ the timeout option, it sends an\n   Option Acknowledgment (OACK) to the client.\
    \  The specified timeout\n   value must match the value specified by the client.\n"
- title: Transfer Size Option Specification
  contents:
  - "Transfer Size Option Specification\n   The TFTP Read Request or Write Request\
    \ packet is modified to include\n   the tsize option as follows:\n      +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+\n\
    \      |  opc  |filename| 0 |  mode  | 0 | tsize  | 0 |  size  | 0 |\n      +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+\n\
    \      opc\n         The opcode field contains either a 1, for Read Requests,\
    \ or 2,\n         for Write Requests, as defined in [1].\n      filename\n   \
    \      The name of the file to be read or written, as defined in [1].\n      \
    \   This is a NULL-terminated field.\n      mode\n         The mode of the file\
    \ transfer: \"netascii\", \"octet\", or \"mail\",\n         as defined in [1].\
    \  This is a NULL-terminated field.\n      tsize\n         The Transfer Size option,\
    \ \"tsize\" (case insensitive).  This is\n         a NULL-terminated field.\n\
    \      size\n         The size of the file to be transfered, specified as a\n\
    \         NULL-terminated ASCII string.\n   For example:\n      +-------+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+\n\
    \      |   2   | foobar | 0 | binary | 0 | tsize  | 0 | 673312 | 0 |\n      +-------+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+\n\
    \   is a Write Request, with the 673312-octet file named \"foobar\", in\n   binary\
    \ transfer mode.\n   In Read Request packets, a size of \"0\" is specified in\
    \ the request\n   and the size of the file, in octets, is returned in the OACK.\
    \  If the\n   file is too large for the client to handle, it may abort the transfer\n\
    \   with an Error packet (error code 3).  In Write Request packets, the\n   size\
    \ of the file, in octets, is specified in the request and echoed\n   back in the\
    \ OACK.  If the file is too large for the server to handle,\n   it may abort the\
    \ transfer with an Error packet (error code 3).\n"
