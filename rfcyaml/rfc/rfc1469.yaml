- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies a method for the transmission of IP multicast\n\
    \   datagrams over Token-Ring Local Area Networks.  Although an interim\n   solution\
    \ has emerged and is currently being used, it is the intention\n   of this document\
    \ to specify a more efficient means of transmission\n   using an assigned Token-Ring\
    \ functional address.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   IP multicasting provides a means of transmitting IP datagrams\
    \ to a\n   group of hosts.  A group IP address is used as the destination\n  \
    \ address in the IP datagram as documented in STD 5, RFC 1112 [1].\n   These group\
    \ addresses, also referred to as Class D addresses, fall in\n   the range from\
    \ 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.  A standard method of\n   mapping IP multicast\
    \ addresses to media types such as ethernet and\n   fddi exist in [1] and RFC\
    \ 1188 [2].  This document attempts to define\n   the mapping for an IP multicast\
    \ address to the corresponding Token-\n   Ring MAC address.\n"
- title: Background
  contents:
  - "Background\n   The Token-Ring Network Architecture Reference [3] provides several\n\
    \   types of addressing mechanisms.  These include both individual\n   (unicast)\
    \ and group addresses (multicast).  A special subtype of\n   group addresses are\
    \ called functional addresses and are indicated by\n   a bit in the destination\
    \ MAC address.  They were designed for widely\n   used functions such as ring\
    \ monitoring, NETBIOS, Bridge, and Lan\n   Manager frames.  There are a limited\
    \ number of functional addresses,\n   31 in all, and therefore several unrelated\
    \ functions must share the\n   same functional address.\n   It would be most desirable\
    \ if Token-Ring could use the same mapping\n   as ethernet and fddi for IP multicast\
    \ to hardware multicast\n   addressing.  However, current implementations of Token-Ring\n\
    \   controller chips cannot support this. To see why, we must first\n   examine\
    \ the Destination MAC address format.\n"
- title: Destination Address Format
  contents:
  - "Destination Address Format\n   The destination MAC address consists of six octets.\
    \  In the following\n   diagram of a MAC address, the order of transmission of\
    \ the octets is\n   from top to bottom (octet 0 to octet 5), and the order of\n\
    \   transmission of the bits within each octet is from right to left (bit\n  \
    \ 0 to bit 7).  This is the so-called \"canonical\" bit order for IEEE\n   802.2\
    \ addresses.  Addresses supplied to or received from token ring\n   interfaces\
    \ are usually laid out in memory with the bits of each octet\n   in the opposite\
    \ order from that illustrated, i.e., with bit 0 in the\n   high-order (leftmost)\
    \ position within the octet.\n            7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0\n    \
    \      ---------------------------------\n          |   |   |   |   |   |   |U/L|I/G|\
    \       octet 0\n          ---------------------------------\n          |   |\
    \   |   |   |   |   |   |   |       octet 1\n          ---------------------------------\n\
    \          |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |FAI|       octet 2\n          ---------------------------------\n\
    \          |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |       octet 3\n          ---------------------------------\n\
    \          |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |       octet 4\n          ---------------------------------\n\
    \          |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |       octet 5\n          ---------------------------------\n\
    \   The low order bit of the high order octet is called the I/G bit. It\n   signifies\
    \ whether the address is an individual address (0) or a group\n   address (1).\
    \ This is comparable to the multicast bit in the DIX\n   Ethernet addressing format.\n\
    \   Bit position 1 of the high order octet, called the U/L bit, specifies\n  \
    \ whether the address is universally administered (0) or locally\n   administered\
    \ (1). Universally administered addresses are those\n   specified by a standards\
    \ organization such as the IEEE.\n   If the I/G bit is set to 1 and the U/L bit\
    \ is 0, the address must be\n   a universally administered group address. If the\
    \ I/G bit is 1 and the\n   U/L bit is a 1, the address may be either a local administered\
    \ group\n   address or a functional address. This distinction is determined by\n\
    \   the Functional Address Indicator (FAI) bit located in bit position 0\n   of\
    \ octet 2.  If the FAI bit is 0, the address is considered a\n   functional address.\
    \  And if the FAI bit is 1, this indicates a\n   locally administered group address.\n\
    \   Different functional addresses are made by setting one of the\n   remaining\
    \ 31 bits in the address field. These bits include the 7\n   remaining bits in\
    \ octet 2 as well as the 8 bits in octets 3, 4, and\n   5. It is not possible\
    \ to create more functional addresses by setting\n   more than one of these bits\
    \ at a time.\n   Three methods exist for mapping between an IP multicast address\
    \ and a\n   hardware address. These include:\n      1.   The all rings broadcast\
    \ address\n      2.   The assigned functional address\n      3.   The existing\
    \ IEEE assigned IP Multicast group addresses\n   In order to insure interoperability,\
    \ all systems supporting IP\n   multicasting on each physical ring must agree\
    \ on the hardware address\n   to be used. Therefore, the method used should be\
    \ configurable on a\n   given interface.  Bridges may provide a means to translate\
    \ between\n   different methods for each physical ring that is being bridged.\n\
    \   Method (3) is recommended but due to hardware limitations of Token-\n   Ring\
    \ controller chips, may not be possible. In this case, Method (2)\n   is preferred\
    \ over Method (1).  For backward compatibility, systems\n   that support (2) MUST\
    \ also support (1). And systems that support (3)\n   MUST also support (2) and\
    \ therefore (1).  In the absence of\n   configuration information, the default\
    \ should be to use the assigned\n   functional address (2).\n"
- title: IP Multicast Functional Address
  contents:
  - "IP Multicast Functional Address\n   Because there is a shortage of Token-Ring\
    \ functional addresses, all\n   IP multicast addresses have been mapped to a single\
    \ Token-Ring\n   functional address. In canonical form, this address is 03-00-00-20-\n\
    \   00-00.  In non-canonical form, it is C0-00-00-04-00-00.  It should be\n  \
    \ noted that since there are only 31 possible functional addresses,\n   there\
    \ may be other protocols that are assigned this functional\n   address as well.\
    \  Therefore, just because a frame is sent to the\n   functional address 03-00-00-20-00-00\
    \ does not mean that it is an IP\n   multicast frame.\n"
