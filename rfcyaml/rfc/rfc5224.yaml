    \ This application is needed as one of the implementations of the Open\n   Mobile\
    \ Alliance (OMA) Policy Evaluation, Enforcement and Management\n   (PEEM) enabler,\
    \ namely for the PEM-1 interface used to send a\n   request/response for Policy\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document summarizes the use of Diameter codes in a\
    \ newly defined\n   realization of a specification for invocation of policy processing.\n\
    \   A new Command Code has been assigned by IANA.  The document\n   summarizes\
    \ the uses of newly defined Diameter codes (a Command Code,\n   an AVP, and a\
    \ vendor-specific application id).  When combined with\n   the Diameter Base protocol,\
    \ this application's specification\n   satisfies the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)\
    \ Policy Evaluation,\n   Enforcement, and Management (PEEM) requirements for sending\
    \ a request\n   for policy processing and receiving a response with the policy\n\
    \   processing result.  See [PEM-1-TS] for the normative use of Diameter.\n  \
    \ PEEM requirements are documented in [PEEM-RD] and PEEM Architecture\n   is documented\
    \ in [PEEM-AD].\n   The Diameter realization of this application assumes the use\
    \ of the\n   Diameter Base protocol, as per RFC 3588, and extends it only for\
    \ a\n   specific application using a vendor-id (PEN), a vendor-specific\n   application\
    \ ID, a new Command Code (314), and a new AVP defined in\n   the vendor-specific\
    \ namespace.  Input to policy processing are being\n   passed through a new AVP,\
    \ and policy results are being passed through\n   a combination of the same new\
    \ AVP, and the Experimental-Result AVP.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The base Diameter specification (Section 1.4 of [RFC3588])\
    \ defines\n   most of the terminology used in this document.  Additionally, the\n\
    \   terms and acronyms defined in [PEM-1-TS] are used in this document.\n"
- title: 3.  Diameter Policy Processing Application
  contents:
  - "3.  Diameter Policy Processing Application\n   A detailed description of the\
    \ Diameter Policy Processing Application\n   can be found in Section 5.4.1 of\
    \ the Policy Evaluation, Enforcement\n   and Management Callable Interface (PEM-1)\
    \ Technical Specification\n   [PEM-1-TS].\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes the Diameter Policy Processing\
    \ Application.\n   It builds on top of the Diameter Base protocol and the same\
    \ security\n   considerations described in RFC 3588 [RFC3588] are applicable to\
    \ this\n   document.  No further extensions are required beyond the security\n\
    \   mechanisms offered by RFC 3588.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers\n   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the\n\
    \   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC2434].\n   This document\
    \ defines values in the namespaces that have been created\n   and defined in the\
    \ Diameter Base [RFC3588].  The IANA Considerations\n   section of that document\
    \ details the assignment criteria.  Values\n   assigned in this document, or by\
    \ future IANA action, must be\n   coordinated within this shared namespace.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Command Codes
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Command Codes\n   This specification assigns the value 314 from the Command\
    \ Code\n   namespace defined in [RFC3588].  See Section 5.4.1.3.1 of [PEM-1-TS]\n\
    \   to see how the command code is used.\n   IANA has made the following assignment\
    \ in the \"Authentication,\n   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Parameters\"\
    \ registry, in the sub-\n   registry \"Command Codes\".\n   Code Value       \
    \   Name                            Reference\n   --------------      -------------------------------\
    \ ---------\n   314                 PDR / PDA                       [RFC5224]\n"
- title: 5.2.  AVP Codes
  contents:
  - "5.2.  AVP Codes\n   This specification uses the value 1 for the Policy-Data AVP,\
    \ in the\n   OMA Vendor-ID (PEN) AVP namespace.  See Section 5.4.1.3.3 of\n  \
    \ [PEM-1-TS] for the assignment of the namespace in this specification.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Application Identifier
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Application Identifier\n   This specification uses the value 16777243 in\
    \ the Application\n   Identifier namespace as registered in IANA for the Policy\
    \ Processing\n   Application.  See Section 5.4.1.3 of [PEM-1-TS] for more information.\n"
