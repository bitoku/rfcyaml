  - "1. Introduction\n   The 6Bone is an IPv6 testbed to assist in the evolution and\n\
    \   deployment of IPv6. Because of this, it is important that the core\n   backbone\
    \ of the IPv6 network maintain stability, and that all\n   operators have a common\
    \ set of rules and guidelines by which to\n   deploy IPv6 routing equipment.\n\
    \   This document provides a set of guidelines for all 6bone routing\n   equipment\
    \ operators to use as a reference for efficient and stable\n   deployment of 6bone\
    \ routing systems. As the complexity of the 6Bone\n   grows,the adherence to a\
    \ common set of rules becomes increasingly\n   important in order for an efficient,\
    \ scalable backbone to exist.\n   This document uses BGP-4 with Multiprotocol\
    \ Extensions for BGP-4 as\n   defined [RFC 2283], commonly referred to as BGP4+,\
    \ as the currently\n   accepted EGP.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC 2119].\n"

- title: 3. Common Rules for the 6bone
  contents:
  - "3. Common Rules for the 6bone\n   This section details common rules governing\
    \ the routing of the 6Bone.\n   They are derived from the issues encountered on\
    \ the 6Bone, with\n   respect to the routes advertised, handling of special addresses,\
    \ and\n   aggregation:\n      1) link local prefixes\n      2) site local prefixes\n\
    \      3) loopback and unspecified prefixes\n      4) multicast prefixes\n   \
    \   5) IPv4-compatible prefixes\n      6) IPv4-mapped prefixes\n      7) default\
    \ routes\n      8) yet undefined unicast prefixes (from a different /3 prefix)\n\
    \      9) inter-site links issues\n      10) 6to4 prefixes\n      11) aggregation\
    \ & advertisement issues\n"
- title: 3.1 Link-local prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.1 Link-local prefixes\n   This link-local prefix (FE80::/10) MUST NOT be advertised\
    \ through\n   either an IGP or an EGP.  Under no circumstance should this prefix\
    \ be\n   seen in the 6Bone backbone routing table.\n   By definition, the link-local\
    \ prefix has a scope limited to a\n   specific link. Since the prefix is the same\
    \ on all IPv6 links,\n   advertising it in any routing protocol does not make\
    \ sense and,\n   worse, may introduce nasty error conditions.\n   Well known cases\
    \ where link-local prefixes could be advertised by\n   mistake include, but are\
    \ not limited to:\n   -  a router advertising all directly connected network prefixes\n\
    \      including the link-local one\n   -  subnetting of the link-local prefix\n\
    \   In such cases, vendors should be urged to correct their code. While\n   vendors\
    \ should be encouraged to fix the problem, the ultimate\n   responsibility lies\
    \ on the operator of that IPv6 site to correct the\n   problem through whatever\
    \ means necessary.\n   Should a pTLA discover link-local prefixes coming from\
    \ another pTLA,\n   it is the responsibility of the pTLA leaking the routes to\
    \ filter\n   these, and correct the problem in a timely fashion. Should a pTLA\n\
    \   discover that a downstream of that pTLA is leaking link-local\n   prefixes,\
    \ it is the pTLA's responsibility to ensure that these\n   prefixes are not leaked\
    \ to other pTLA's, or to other downstreams of\n   that pTLA.\n   Failure to filter\
    \ such routes in a timely fashion may result in the\n   manual shutting down of\
    \ BGP4+ sessions to that pTLA, from other\n   pTLA's.\n   (Also, it is each pTLA,\
    \ pNLA, and end-site's responsibility to not\n   only filter their own BGP4+ sessions\
    \ appropriately to peers, but to\n   filter routes coming from peers as well,\
    \ and to only allow those\n   routes that fit the aggregation model, and do not\
    \ cause operational\n   problems).\n"
- title: 3.2 Site-local prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.2 Site-local prefixes\n   Site local prefixes (in the FEC0::/10 range) MAY\
    \ be advertised by\n   IGP's or EGP's within a site. The precise definition of\
    \ a site is\n   ongoing work of the IPng working group, but should generally include\n\
    \   a group of nodes that are operating under one administrator or group\n   of\
    \ administrators, or a group of nodes which are used for a common\n   purpose.\n\
    \   Site-local prefixes MUST NOT be advertised across transit pNLAs,\n   pTLAs,\
    \ or leaf-sites.\n   Again, should site-local prefixes be leaked outside of a\
    \ given site,\n   it is the responsibility of the site to fix the problem in a\
    \ timely\n   manner, either through filters, or via other means which remove the\n\
    \   operational impact that those prefixes had on the peering sites\n   involved.\
    \ However, every site SHOULD filter not only outbound on\n   their EGP, but also\
    \ inbound, in order to ensure proper routing\n   announcements are not only sent,\
    \ but also received.\n"
- title: 3.3 Loopback and unspecified prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.3 Loopback and unspecified prefixes\n   The loopback prefix (::1/128) and the\
    \ unspecified prefix (::0/128)\n   MUST NOT be advertised by any routing protocol.\n\
    \   The same responsibility lies with the party guilty of advertising the\n  \
    \ loopback or unspecified prefix as in Section 3.1 and 3.2.\n"
- title: 3.4 Multicast prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.4 Multicast prefixes\n   Multicast prefixes MUST NOT be advertised by any unicast\
    \ routing\n   protocol. Multicast routing protocols are designed to respect the\n\
    \   semantics of multicast and MUST therefore be used to route packets\n   with\
    \ multicast destination addresses (in the range of FF00::/8).\n   Multicast address\
    \ scopes MUST be respected on the 6Bone.  Only global\n   scope multicast addresses\
    \ MAY be routed across transit pNLAs and\n   pTLAs.  There is no requirement on\
    \ a pTLA to route multicast packets\n   at the time of the writing of this memo.\n\
    \   Organization-local multicasts (in the FF08::/16 or FF18::/16 ranges)\n   MAY\
    \ be routed across a pNLA to its leaf sites.\n   Site-local multicasts MUST NOT\
    \ be routed toward transit pNLAs or\n   pTLAs.\n   Link-local multicasts and node-local\
    \ multicasts MUST NOT be routed at\n   all.\n"
- title: 3.5 IPv4 compatible prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.5 IPv4 compatible prefixes\n   Sites may choose to use IPv4 compatible addresses\
    \ (::a.b.c.d where\n   a.b.c.d represents the octets of an IPv4 address) internally.\
    \ As\n   there is no real rationale today for doing so, these address SHOULD\n\
    \   NOT be used or routed in the 6Bone.\n   The ::/96 IPv4-compatible prefixes\
    \ MAY be advertised by IGPs.\n   IPv4 compatible prefixes MUST NOT be advertised\
    \ by EGPs to transit\n   pNLAs or pTLAs.\n   Should ::/96 IPv4-compatible prefixes\
    \ be leaked into an EGP, it is\n   the responsibility of the party who is advertising\
    \ the route to fix\n   the problem, either through proper filters, or through\
    \ other means,\n   while it remains in the best interest of all particiapants\
    \ of the\n   6Bone to filter both outbound and inbound at their IGP borders.\n"
- title: 3.6 IPv4-mapped prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.6 IPv4-mapped prefixes\n   IPv4-mapped prefixes (::FFFF:a.b.c.d where a.b.c.d\
    \ represents the\n   octets of an IPv4 address) MAY be advertised by IGPs within\
    \ a site.\n   It may be useful for some IPv6 only nodes within a site to have\
    \ such\n   a route pointing to a translation device, to aid in deployment of\n\
    \   IPv6.\n   IPv4-mapped prefixes MUST NOT be advertised by EGPs.\n"
- title: 3.7 Default routes
  contents:
  - "3.7 Default routes\n   6Bone core pTLA routers MUST be default-free.\n   pTLAs\
    \ MAY advertise a default route to any downstream peer (non-pTLA\n   site). Transit\
    \ pNLAs MAY advertise a default route to any of their\n   downstreams (other transit\
    \ pNLA or leaf site).\n   Should a default route be redistributed into an EGP\
    \ and found on any\n   pTLA EGP sessions, it is the responsibility of the pTLA\
    \ to fix this\n   problem immediately upon realization of the route's existence,\
    \ and\n   the responsibility of the guilty pTLA to push the entity from which\n\
    \   the default route was originated, should the default route have\n   originated\
    \ from downstream of a pTLA.\n"

    \   routing tables.\n"
- title: 3.10 6to4 Prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.10 6to4 Prefixes\n   The 6to4 prefix, or some portion thereof, MAY be announced\
    \ by any\n   pTLA which has a current implementation of 6to4 in their IPv6\n \
    \  network.  However, as 6to4 implementors gain more operational\n   experience,\
    \ it MAY be necessary to change this in some way.  At the\n   time of the writing\
    \ of this docuement, any pTLA MAY announce the 6to4\n   prefix into global EBGP.\
    \ However, in order to announce this block,\n   the pTLA MUST have a 6to4 router\
    \ active, sourcing this prefix\n   announcement.\n   This section subject to change,\
    \ and MAY vary, depending on 6to4\n   progress within the NGTRANS working group.\n"
- title: 3.11 Aggregation & advertisement issues
  contents:
  - "3.11 Aggregation & advertisement issues\n   Route aggregation MUST be performed\
    \ by any border router talking EGP\n   with any other IPv6 sites. More-specifics\
    \ MUST NOT be leaked into or\n   across the IPv6 6Bone backbone.\n"
- title: 4. Routing Policies for the 6bone
  contents:
  - "4. Routing Policies for the 6bone\n   Leaf sites or pNLAs MUST only advertise\
    \ to an upstream provider the\n   prefixes assigned by that provider. Advertising\
    \ a prefix assigned by\n   another provider to a provider is not acceptable, and\
    \ breaks the\n   aggregation model. A site MUST NOT advertise a prefix from another\n\
    \   provider to a provider as a way around the multi-homing problem.\n   However,\
    \ in the interest of testing new solutions, one may break this\n   policy, so\
    \ long as ALL affected parties  are aware of this test, and\n   all agree to support\
    \ this testing.  These policy breaks MUST NOT\n   affect the 6bone routing table\
    \ globally.\n   To clarify, if one has two upstream pNLA or pTLA providers, (A\
    \ and B\n   for this example), one MUST only announce the prefix delegated to\
    \ one\n   by provider A to provider A, and one MUST only announce the prefeix\n\
    \   delegated by one from provider B upstream to provider B. There exists\n  \
    \ no circumstance where this should be violated, as it breaks the\n   aggregation\
    \ model, and could globally affect routing decisions if\n   downstreams are able\
    \ to leak other providers' more specific\n   delegations up to a pTLA. As the\
    \ IPNG working group works through the\n   multi-homing problem, there may be\
    \ a need to alter this rule\n   slightly, to test new strategies for deployment.\
    \ However, in the case\n   of current specifications at the time of this writing,\
    \ there is no\n   reason to advertise more specifics, and pTLA's MUST adhere to\
    \ the\n   current aggregation model.\n   Site border routers for pNLA or leaf\
    \ sites MUST NOT advertise\n   prefixes more specific (longer) than the prefix\
    \ that was allocated by\n   their upstream provider.\n   All 6bone pTLAs MUST\
    \ NOT advertise prefixes longer than a given pTLA\n   delegation (currently /24\
    \ or /28) to other 6bone pTLAs unless special\n   peering arrangements are implemented.\
    \ When such special peering\n   aggreements are in place between any two or more\
    \ 6bone pTLAs, care\n   MUST be taken not to leak the more specifics to other\
    \ 6bone pTLAs not\n   participating in the peering aggreement. 6bone pTLAs which\
    \ have such\n   agreements in place MUST NOT  advertise other 6bone pTLA more\n\
    \   specifics to downstream 6bone pNLAs or leaf sites, as this will break\n  \
    \ the best-path routing decision.\n   The peering agreements across the 6Bone\
    \ may be by nature non-\n   commercial, and therefore MAY allow transit traffic,\
    \ if peering\n   agreements of this nature are made. However, no pTLA is REQUIRED\
    \ to\n   give or receive transit service from another pTLA.\n   Eventually, the\
    \ Internet registries will assign prefixes under other\n   than the 6Bone TLA\
    \ (3FFE::/16). As of the time this document was\n   written in 1999, the Internet\
    \ registries were starting to assign /35\n   sub-TLA (sTLA) blocks from the 2001::/16\
    \ TLA. Others will certainly\n   be used in the future.\n   The organizations\
    \ receiving prefixes under these newer TLAs would be\n   expected to want to establish\
    \ peering and connectivity relationships\n   with other IPv6 networks, both in\
    \ the newer TLA space and in the\n   6bone pTLA space. Peering between new TLA's\
    \ and the current 6Bone\n   pTLA's MAY occur, and details such as transit, and\
    \ what routes are\n   received by each, are outside of general peering rules as\
    \ stated in\n   this memo, and are left up to the members of those TLA's and pTLA's\n\
    \   that are establishing said peerings. However, it is expected that\n   most\
    \ of the rules discussed here are equally applicable to new TLAs.\n"

  - "9.  Common rules enforcement for the 6bone\n   Participation in the 6Bone is\
    \ a voluntary and benevolent undertaking.\n   However, participating sites are\
    \ expected to adhere to the rules and\n   policies described in this document\
    \ in order to maintain the 6Bone as\n   a quality tool for the deployment of,\
    \ and transition to, IPv6\n   protocols and the products implementing them.\n\
    \   The following is in support of policing adherence to 6Bone rules and\n   policies:\n\
    \   1. Each pTLA site has committed to implement the 6Bone's rules and\n     \
    \ policies, and SHOULD try to ensure they are adhered to by sites\n      within\
    \ their administrative control, i.e. those to who prefixes\n      under their\
    \ respective pTLA prefix have been delegated.\n   2. When a site detects an issue,\
    \ it SHOULD first use the 6Bone\n      registry to contact the site maintainer\
    \ and work the issue.\n   3. If nothing happens, or there is disagreement on what\
    \ the right\n      solution is, the issue SHOULD be brought to the 6Bone Operations\n\
    \      Group.\n   4. When the problem is related to a product issue, the site(s)\n\
    \      involved SHOULD be responsible for contacting  the product vendor\n   \
    \   and work toward its resolution.\n   5. When an issue causes major operational\
    \ problems, backbone sites\n      SHOULD decide to temporarily set filters in\
    \ order to restore\n      service.\n"

  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   The result of incorrect entries in routing tables\
    \ is usually\n   unreachable sites.  Having guidelines to aggregate or reject\
    \ routes\n   will clean up the routing tables. It is expected that using these\n\
    \   rules and policies, routing on the 6Bone will be less sensitive to\n   denial\
    \ of service attacks due to misleading routes.\n   The 6Bone is an IPv6 testbed\
    \ to assist in the evolution and\n   deployment of IPv6. Therefore, denial of\
    \ service or packet disclosure\n   are to be expected.  However, it is the pTLA\
    \ from where the attack\n   originated who has ultimate responsibility for isolating\
    \ and fixing\n   problems of this nature. It is also every 6Bone site's responsibility\n\
    \   to safely introduce new test systems into the 6Bone, by placing them\n   at\
    \ a strategically safe places which will have minimal impact on\n   other 6Bone\
    \ sites, should bugs or misconfigurations occur.\n"
