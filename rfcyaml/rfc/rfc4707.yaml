- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Netnews Administration System (NAS) is a framework to simplify\n\
    \   the administration and usage of network news (also known as Netnews)\n   on\
    \ the Internet.  Data for the administration of newsgroups and\n   hierarchies\
    \ are kept in a distributed hierarchical database and are\n   available through\
    \ a client-server protocol.\n   The database is accessible by news servers, news\
    \ administrators, and\n   news readers.  News servers can update their configuration\n\
    \   automatically; administrators are able to get the data manually.\n   News\
    \ reader programs are able to get certain information from an NAS\n   server,\
    \ automatically or at a user's discretion, which provides\n   detailed information\
    \ about groups and hierarchies to the user.\n   NAS is usable in coexistence with\
    \ the current, established process of\n   control messages; an unwanted interference\
    \ is impossible.\n   Furthermore, NAS is able to reflect the somewhat chaotic\
    \ structure of\n   Usenet in a hierarchical database.  NAS can be used without\n\
    \   modification of existing news relay, news server, or news reader\n   software;\
    \ however, some tasks will be better accomplished with NAS-\n   compliant software.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   An increasing number of newsgroups, hierarchies, and articles\
    \ has\n   made the administration of news servers a complex and time-consuming\n\
    \   task.  The tools for the administration have remained unchanged for\n   ten\
    \ years and are no longer appropriate.  Many hierarchies are\n   inconsistent;\
    \ many new newsgroups are not created or only with a\n   large delay; removed\
    \ groups keep lurking in the configuration files\n   for a long period of time.\
    \  There is no administration tool that\n   utilizes the power of the Internet,\
    \ and it is not possible to check\n   the consistency of the news server at a\
    \ given point of time.\n   Users find it difficult to get an overview of the newsgroups,\
    \ the\n   charter of a particular one, which language is preferred, or whether\n\
    \   a group is moderated.  Renaming, the status change from moderated to\n   unmoderated\
    \ or vice versa, and the splitting of a group into several\n   others are dynamic\
    \ processes.  These processes are in common use, but\n   it takes a long time\
    \ until every news server is aware of these\n   changes.\n   An increasing number\
    \ of faked control messages has appeared in the\n   last few years.  Purposely\
    \ or accidentally, control messages were\n   sent to foreign news servers to create\
    \ or remove a certain group,\n   although this was not approved according to the\
    \ rules of the\n   hierarchy in question.  Due to this fact, automatic creation\
    \ and\n   removal are disabled on many news servers, and several dead groups\n\
    \   have not been deleted.  It is very difficult for users to determine\n   the\
    \ current status of a group, and in some cases they simply cannot\n   tell that\
    \ the group they are posting to is not an active group but a\n   dead or invalid\
    \ one.\n   It is the design goal of Netnews Administration System (NAS) to\n \
    \  provide an out-of-band system that helps to maintain, propagate, and\n   deliver\
    \ the required information.  There will not be any interference\n   with current\
    \ protocols and standards.  It is not intended to make use\n   of control messages\
    \ or some special Network News Transfer Protocol\n   (NNTP) commands.  The advantage\
    \ of NAS is that it provides more\n   information in a more structured format\
    \ than that of control\n   messages.  Not only news server administrators but\
    \ also Usenet users\n   can get more detailed information about newsgroups and\
    \ hierarchies.\n   Due to the fact that a client connects to a server and the\
    \ server\n   asks for authentication, this is a more reasonable procedure for\n\
    \   transmitting information than that for control messages.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ it is possible to check for changes on a regular basis\n   at customized intervals\
    \ to keep local data up-to-date.\n"
- title: 2.  Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   NAS is based on a database that contains information about certain\n\
    \   groups and hierarchies.  This database is structured in a\n   hierarchical\
    \ manner and distributed to various servers, and it is\n   able to receive queries\
    \ at any time.  The service is comparable to\n   directory services like DNS,\
    \ Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n   (LDAP), or Network Information Service\
    \ (NIS).  The NAS protocol is\n   inspired by protocols like NNTP and SMTP.  The\
    \ port 991 is reserved\n   for NAS and registered by the Internet Assigned Numbers\
    \ Authority\n   (IANA) [IANA-PN].\n   The organizational structure of NAS is hierarchical;\
    \ this means that\n   a NAS root server collects data from the sub-servers that\
    \ are\n   authoritative for certain hierarchies.  The root server signs the\n\
    \   data and distributes it authoritatively.  Replication of database\n   entries\
    \ is possible.  The hierarchical structure can consist of\n   multiple levels.\
    \  Usage of the database is possible for news servers,\n   news readers, and special\
    \ client programs.  The communication is\n   based on TCP and UDP.\n   Taking\
    \ the real world into account, there might be some policy\n   problems with a\
    \ single root server.  But it is possible to establish\n   a structure like that\
    \ of the current Usenet system, where some\n   hierarchies have a good administration\
    \ with a well-defined system of\n   rules, and where some are not well maintained.\
    \  The goal is to get as\n   much information as possible under one hat, but there\
    \ can be no\n   \"official\" force to achieve this.\n   During the startup phase,\
    \ it is quite likely that there will be a\n   root server, handling just hierarchies\
    \ with strict rules and accepted\n   authorities (e.g., BIG8, de.*, us.*, bln.*,\
    \ fr.*, it.*).\n   However, it is also imaginable to have some NAS servers providing\n\
    \   data on, for example, alt.!binaries, some providing data on alt.*,\n   and\
    \ even some providing alt.*  following special policies or sets of\n   rules.\n\
    \   An administrator using NAS will have the choice to use just one root\n   server\
    \ (and all its data) or to use another NAS server for special\n   hierarchies.\n\

- title: 3.  Protocol Level
  contents:
  - "3.  Protocol Level\n   It is expected that the real-life use of NAS will change\
    \ the\n   requirements for the Netnews Administration System.  On the one hand,\n\
    \   the protocol has to be extensible and flexible in order to implement\n   improvements;\
    \ on the other hand, it must ensure compatibility between\n   different versions.\
    \  A simultaneous migration of all sites using NAS\n   to a new protocol version\
    \ is not likely to happen.  To solve this\n   problem, NAS has a protocol level.\
    \  This protocol level describes the\n   current functionality.  The protocol\
    \ level, being a number between 1\n   and 32767, is negotiated at connection setup.\
    \  Enhancements and\n   modifications must use a different protocol level than\
    \ that of their\n   predecessors.  (Usually the protocol level is incremented\
    \ by 1 with\n   every new version of the protocol specification.) Every current\
    \ or\n   future implementation MUST be compatible with protocol level 1 in\n \
    \  order to fall back to this level if communication on a higher level\n   fails.\n\
    \   An implementation of higher protocol levels should be able to emulate\n  \
    \ the behavior of lower levels, even if this implies a loss of\n   features. \
    \ The negotiation of the protocol level between client and\n   server is described\
    \ in the specification of the command VERS.  If\n   there is no agreement on the\
    \ protocol level, only commands of the\n   protocol level 1 MUST be used.  Documents\
    \ enhancing or modifying the\n   NAS standard MUST specify on which level these\
    \ changes take place and\n   how the behavior should be in other protocol levels.\n\
    \   This document describes protocol level 1.\n"
- title: 4.  Description of Functions
  contents:
  - "4.  Description of Functions\n   In order to use an NAS server, a connection\
    \ must be opened by the\n   client.  The NAS server can be located in the same\
    \ domain or\n   somewhere else on the Internet.\n   The NAS system is hierarchical.\
    \  The idea is to have an NAS root\n   server like the DNS root servers.  The\
    \ root server distributes the\n   data collected from client NAS servers that\
    \ are authoritative servers\n   for their hierarchy.  The maintenance of the authoritative\
    \ data is\n   possible on any system.  The root server collects the data and makes\n\
    \   them available to other servers, which can in turn distribute these\n   data\
    \ to other servers.  The administrator has the opportunity to make\n   use of\
    \ either all data or only parts of the database.  NAS servers\n   can ask multiple\
    \ NAS servers for data.  An attached time stamp makes\n   it possible to distinguish\
    \ between new and old data and to avoid\n   loops in the propagation.\n   To describe\
    \ the NAS in greater detail, it is necessary to emphasize\n   the hierarchical\
    \ design of the NAS system.  The following figure\n   shows the propagation of\
    \ data along the server hierarchy.\n   Authoritative data for a newsgroup or a\
    \ hierarchy are collected and\n   written into a database.  These data are available\
    \ through a local\n   NAS server and are collected from this authoritative server\
    \ by\n   upstream NAS servers.\n   There may also be NAS servers that are not\
    \ authoritative servers;\n   these servers merely provide the information they\
    \ collect from other\n   NAS servers to clients such as news servers, administration\
    \ programs,\n   and news readers.\n            ............     collects from\

  - "6.3.1.  Structure\n   A command consists of a command word, sometimes followed\
    \ by a\n   parameter.  Parameters are separated from the command word by white\n\
    \   space.\n   Commands used in the NAS protocol are not case sensitive.  A command\n\
    \   word or parameter may be uppercase, lowercase, or any mixture of\n   upper-\
    \ and lowercase.\n   The length of a command line is not limited.  If the need\
    \ to limit\n   the length of command lines in real-life implementations arises,\n\
    \   answer code 513 (line too long) should be returned.\n   The protocol level\
    \ described in this document uses command words with\n   a length of exactly four\
    \ characters each.\n   In examples, octets sent to the NAS server are preceded\
    \ by \"<-- \" and\n   those sent by the NAS server by \"--> \".  The indicator\
    \ is omitted if\n   the direction of the dialog does not change.\n"

  - "6.3.2.  Overview\n   The commands described below are defined using the Augmented\
    \ Backus-\n   Naur Form (ABNF) defined in [RFC4234].  The definitions for 'ALPHA',\n\
    \   'CRLF', 'DIGIT', 'WSP' and 'VCHAR' are taken from appendix B of\n   [RFC4234]\

  - "6.3.3.10.  GETP\n   Description\n   GETP is used for server-server communication.\
    \  It requests the data\n   for the hierarchy specified by the parameter \"name\"\
    .  The format of\n   the data is the same as for the commands \"HIER\" and \"\
    LIST\".  If \"*\"\n   is given as hierarchy name, all data the server is offering\
    \ will be\n   transmitted.\n   The \"timestamp\" attached to a package consists\
    \ of the date and time\n   that the package was created.  The timestamp for a\
    \ package is\n   transmitted together with the package data by the server and\
    \ marks a\n   specific revision for the package data.\n   When a client requests\
    \ a package with GETP, it transmits the\n   timestamp attached to the package\
    \ in its database so that the server\n   can check whether the data on the client\
    \ side is still valid or if it\n   is too old.  If the data on the client side\
    \ is still valid, a 213\n   answer is sent, so the client knows that its data\
    \ is OK.  If the\n   timestamp is \"0\", the server is forced to transmit the\
    \ data.\n   Timestamps set by the server must be increasing and may not be more\n\
    \   than 12 hours in the future.\n   The data for a successful request are signed\
    \ and sent in ASCII armor\n   according to [RFC2440], so a client can check the\
    \ signature or ignore\n   it.  The actual data will be surrounded by the armor\
    \ start and end\n   sections, according to Section 6.2 of [RFC2440].\n   getp-cmd\

    \   Every server does have the possibility (in both server-server and\n   server-client\
