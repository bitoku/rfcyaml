- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   S/MIME [RFC5751] messages often contain a certificate (some\
    \ messages\n   contain more than one certificate).  These certificates assist\
    \ in\n   authenticating the sender of the message and can be used for\n   encrypting\
    \ messages that will be sent in reply.  In order for the\n   S/MIME receiver to\
    \ authenticate that a message is from the sender\n   identified in the message,\
    \ the receiver's Mail User Agent (MUA) must\n   validate that this certificate\
    \ is associated with the purported\n   sender.  Currently, the MUA must trust\
    \ a trust anchor upon which the\n   sender's certificate is rooted and must successfully\
    \ validate the\n   certificate.  There are other requirements on the MUA, such\
    \ as\n   associating the identity in the certificate with that of the message,\n\
    \   that are out of scope for this document.\n   Some people want to authenticate\
    \ the association of the sender's\n   certificate with the sender without trusting\
    \ a configured trust\n   anchor.  Others to want mitigate the difficulty of finding\n\
    \   certificates from outside the enterprise.  Given that the DNS\n   administrator\
    \ for a domain name is authorized to give identifying\n   information about the\
    \ zone, it makes sense to allow that\n   administrator to also make an authoritative\
    \ binding between email\n   messages purporting to come from the domain name and\
    \ a certificate\n   that might be used by someone authorized to send mail from\
    \ those\n   servers.  The easiest way to do this is to use the DNS.\n   This document\
    \ describes a mechanism for associating a user's\n   certificate with the domain\
    \ that is similar to that described in DANE\n   itself [RFC6698], as updated by\
    \ [RFC7218] and [RFC7671]; it is also\n   similar to the mechanism given in [RFC7929]\
    \ for OpenPGP.  Most of the\n   operational and security considerations for using\
    \ the mechanism in\n   this document are described in RFC 6698 and are not described\
    \ here at\n   all.  Only the major differences between this mechanism and those\n\
    \   used in RFC 6698 are described here.  Thus, the reader must be\n   familiar\
    \ with RFC 6698 before reading this document.\n"

- title: 1.2.  Experiment Goal
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Experiment Goal\n   This specification is one experiment in improving access\
    \ to public\n   keys for end-to-end email security.  There are a range of ways\
    \ in\n   which this can reasonably be done for OpenPGP or S/MIME, for example,\n\
    \   using the DNS, SMTP, or HTTP.  Proposals for each of these have been\n   made\
    \ with various levels of support in terms of implementation and\n   deployment.\
    \  For each such experiment, specifications such as this\n   will enable experiments\
    \ to be carried out that may succeed or that\n   may uncover technical or other\
    \ impediments to large- or small-scale\n   deployments.  The IETF encourages those\
    \ implementing and deploying\n   such experiments to publicly document their experiences\
    \ so that\n   future specifications in this space can benefit.\n   This document\
    \ defines an RRtype whose use is Experimental.  The goal\n   of the experiment\
    \ is to see whether encrypted email usage will\n   increase if an automated discovery\
    \ method is available to Mail\n   Transfer Agents (MTAs) and if MUAs help the\
    \ end user with email\n   encryption key management.\n   It is unclear if this\
    \ RRtype will scale to some of the larger email\n   service deployments.  Concerns\
    \ have been raised about the size of the\n   SMIMEA record and the size of the\
    \ resulting DNS zone files.  This\n   experiment hopefully will give the IETF\
    \ some insight into whether or\n   not this is a problem.\n   If the experiment\
    \ is successful, it is expected that the findings of\n   the experiment will result\
    \ in an updated document for Standards Track\n   approval.\n"
- title: 2.  The SMIMEA Resource Record
  contents:
  - "2.  The SMIMEA Resource Record\n   The SMIMEA DNS resource record (RR) is used\
    \ to associate an end\n   entity certificate or public key with the associated\
    \ email address,\n   thus forming a \"SMIMEA certificate association\".  The semantics\
    \ of\n   how the SMIMEA resource record is interpreted are given later in this\n\
    \   document.  Note that the information returned in the SMIMEA record\n   might\
    \ be for the end entity certificate, or it might be for the trust\n   anchor or\
    \ an intermediate certificate.  This mechanism is similar to\n   the one given\
    \ in [RFC7929] for OpenPGP.\n   The type value for the SMIMEA RRtype is defined\
    \ in Section 8.  The\n   SMIMEA resource record is class independent.\n   The\
    \ SMIMEA wire format and presentation format are the same as for\n   the TLSA\
    \ record as described in Section 2.1 of [RFC6698].  The\n   certificate usage\
    \ field, the selector field, and the matching type\n   field have the same format;\
    \ the semantics are also the same except\n   where RFC 6698 talks about TLS as\
    \ the target protocol for the\n   certificate information.\n"
- title: 3.  Location of the SMIMEA Record
  contents:
  - "3.  Location of the SMIMEA Record\n   The DNS does not allow the use of all characters\
    \ that are supported\n   in the \"local-part\" of email addresses as defined in\
    \ [RFC5322] and\n   [RFC6530].  Therefore, email addresses are mapped into DNS\
    \ using the\n   following method:\n   1.  The \"left-hand side\" of the email\
    \ address, called the \"local-\n       part\" in both the mail message format\
    \ definition [RFC5322] and in\n       the specification for internationalized\
    \ email [RFC6530]) is\n       encoded in UTF-8 (or its subset ASCII).  If the\
    \ local-part is\n       written in another charset, it MUST be converted to UTF-8.\n\
    \   2.  The local-part is first canonicalized using the following rules.\n   \
    \    If the local-part is unquoted, any comments and/or folding\n       whitespace\
    \ (CFWS) around dots (\".\") is removed.  Any enclosing\n       double quotes\
    \ are removed.  Any literal quoting is removed.\n   3.  If the local-part contains\
    \ any non-ASCII characters, it SHOULD be\n       normalized using the Unicode\
    \ Normalization Form C from [UNICODE].\n       Recommended normalization rules\
    \ can be found in Section 10.1 of\n       [RFC6530].\n   4.  The local-part is\
    \ hashed using the SHA2-256 [RFC5754] algorithm,\n       with the hash truncated\
    \ to 28 octets and represented in its\n       hexadecimal representation, to become\
    \ the left-most label in the\n       prepared domain name.\n   5.  The string\
    \ \"_smimecert\" becomes the second left-most label in the\n       prepared domain\
    \ name.\n   6.  The domain name (the \"right-hand side\" of the email address,\n\
    \       called the \"domain\" in [RFC5322]) is appended to the result of\n   \
    \    step 5 to complete the prepared domain name.\n   For example, to request\
    \ an SMIMEA resource record for a user whose\n   email address is \"hugh@example.com\"\
    , an SMIMEA query would be placed\n   for the following QNAME: \"c93f1e400f26708f98cb19d936620da35eec8f72e57\n\
    \   f9eec01c1afd6._smimecert.example.com\".\n"
- title: 4.  Email Address Variants and Internationalization Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Email Address Variants and Internationalization Considerations\n   Mail systems\
    \ usually handle variant forms of local-parts.  The most\n   common variants are\
    \ upper and lower case, often automatically\n   corrected when a name is recognized\
    \ as such.  Other variants include\n   systems that ignore \"noise\" characters\
    \ such as dots, so that local-\n   parts 'johnsmith' and 'John.Smith' would be\
    \ equivalent.  Many systems\n   allow \"extensions\" such as 'john-ext' or 'mary+ext'\
    \ where 'john' or\n   'mary' is treated as the effective local-part, and the 'ext'\
    \ is\n   passed to the recipient for further handling.  This can complicate\n\
    \   finding the SMIMEA record associated with the dynamically created\n   email\
    \ address.\n   [RFC5321] and its predecessors have always made it clear that only\n\
    \   the recipient MTA is allowed to interpret the local-part of an\n   address.\
    \  Therefore, sending MUAs and MTAs supporting this\n   specification MUST NOT\
    \ perform any kind of mapping rules based on the\n   email address.  In order\
    \ to improve the chances of finding SMIMEA\n   resource records for a particular\
    \ local-part, domains that allow\n   variant forms (such as treating local-parts\
    \ as case-insensitive)\n   might publish SMIMEA resource records for all variants\
    \ of local-\n   parts, might publish variants on first use (for example, a webmail\n\
    \   provider that also controls DNS for a domain can publish variants as\n   used\
    \ by owner of a particular local-part), or might just publish\n   SMIMEA resource\
    \ records for the most common variants.\n   Section 3 above defines how the local-part\
    \ is used to determine the\n   location in which one looks for an SMIMEA resource\
    \ record.  Given the\n   variety of local-parts seen in email, designing a good\
    \ experiment for\n   this is difficult as a) some current implementations are\
    \ known to\n   lowercase at least US-ASCII local-parts, b) we know from (many)\
    \ other\n   situations that any strategy based on guessing and making multiple\n\
    \   DNS queries is not going to achieve consensus for good reasons, and\n   c)\
    \ the underlying issues are just hard -- see Section 10.1 of\n   [RFC6530] for\
    \ discussion of just some of the issues that would need\n   to be tackled to fully\
    \ address this problem.\n   However, while this specification is not the place\
    \ to try to address\n   these issues with local-parts, doing so is also not required\
    \ to\n   determine the outcome of this experiment.  If this experiment\n   succeeds,\
    \ then further work on email addresses with non-ASCII local-\n   parts will be\
    \ needed, and that would be better based on the findings\n   from this experiment,\
    \ rather than doing nothing or starting this\n   experiment based on a speculative\
    \ approach to what is a very complex\n   topic.\n"

    \ MUST be able to\n   correctly interpret SMIMEA records with certificate usages\
    \ 0, 1, 2,\n   and 3.  S/MIME MUAs conforming to this specification MUST be able\

    \ MUST be able to\n   interpret any S/MIME capabilities (defined in [RFC4262])\
    \ in any\n   certificates that it receives through SMIMEA records.\n"
- title: 6.  Application Use of S/MIME Certificate Associations
  contents:
  - "6.  Application Use of S/MIME Certificate Associations\n   The SMIMEA record\
    \ allows an application or service to obtain an\n   S/MIME certificate or public\
    \ key and use it for verifying a digital\n   signature or encrypting a message\
    \ to the public key.  The DNS answer\n   MUST pass DNSSEC validation; if DNSSEC\
    \ validation reaches any state\n   other than \"Secure\" (as specified in [RFC4035]),\
    \ the DNSSEC\n   validation MUST be treated as a failure.\n   If no S/MIME certificates\
    \ are known for an email address, an SMIMEA\n   DNS lookup MAY be performed to\
    \ seek the certificate or public key\n   that corresponds to that email address.\
    \  This can then be used to\n   verify a received signed message or can be used\
    \ to send out an\n   encrypted email message.  An application whose attempt fails\
    \ to\n   retrieve a DNSSEC-verified SMIMEA resource record from the DNS should\n\
    \   remember that failed attempt and not retry it for some time.  This\n   will\
    \ avoid sending out a DNS request for each email message the\n   application is\
    \ sending out; such DNS requests constitute a privacy\n   leak.\n"
- title: 7.  Certificate Size and DNS
  contents:
  - "7.  Certificate Size and DNS\n   Due to the expected size of the SMIMEA record,\

    \ resource\n   record.\n   Although the reliability of the transport of large\
    \ DNS resource\n   records has improved in the last years, it is still recommended\
    \ to\n   keep the DNS records as small as possible without sacrificing the\n \
    \  security properties of the public key.  The algorithm type and key\n   size\

- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Client treatment of any information included\
    \ in the trust anchor is a\n   matter of local policy.  This specification does\
    \ not mandate that\n   such information be inspected or validated by the domain\
    \ name\n   administrator.\n   DNSSEC does not protect the queries from pervasive\
    \ monitoring as\n   defined in [RFC7258].  Since DNS queries are currently mostly\n\
    \   unencrypted, a query to look up a target SMIMEA record could reveal\n   that\
    \ a user using the (monitored) recursive DNS server is attempting\n   to send\
    \ encrypted email to a target.\n   Various components could be responsible for\
    \ encrypting an email\n   message to a target recipient.  It could be done by\
    \ the sender's MUA,\n   an MUA plugin, or the sender's MTA.  Each of these have\
    \ their own\n   characteristics.  An MUA can ask the user to make a decision before\n\
    \   continuing.  The MUA can either accept or refuse a message.  The MTA\n   might\
    \ deliver the message as is or encrypt the message before\n   delivering.  Each\
    \ of these components should attempt to encrypt an\n   unencrypted outgoing message\
    \ whenever possible.\n   In theory, two different local-parts could hash to the\
    \ same value.\n   This document assumes that such a hash collision has a negligible\n\
    \   chance of happening.\n   If an obtained S/MIME certificate is revoked or expired,\
    \ that\n   certificate MUST NOT be used, even if that would result in sending\
    \ a\n   message in plaintext.\n   Anyone who can obtain a DNSSEC private key of\
    \ a domain name via\n   coercion, theft, or brute-force calculations can replace\
    \ any SMIMEA\n   record in that zone and all of the delegated child zones.  Any\
    \ future\n   messages encrypted with the malicious SMIMEA key could then be read.\n\
    \   Therefore, a certificate or key obtained from a DNSSEC-validated\n   SMIMEA\
    \ record can only be trusted as much as the DNS domain can be\n   trusted.\n \
    \  Organizations that are required to be able to read everyone's\n   encrypted\
    \ email should publish the escrow key as the SMIMEA record.\n   Mail servers of\
    \ such organizations MAY optionally re-encrypt the\n   message to the individual's\
    \ S/MIME key.  This case can be considered\n   a special case of the key-replacement\
    \ attack described above.\n"

- title: 9.2.  Email Address Information Leak
  contents:
  - "9.2.  Email Address Information Leak\n   The hashing of the local-part in this\
    \ document is not a security\n   feature.  Publishing SMIMEA records will create\
    \ a list of hashes of\n   valid email addresses, which could simplify obtaining\
    \ a list of valid\n   email addresses for a particular domain.  It is desirable\
    \ to not ease\n   the harvesting of email addresses where possible.\n   The domain\
    \ name part of the email address is not used as part of the\n   hash so that hashes\
    \ can be used in multiple zones deployed using\n   DNAME [RFC6672].  This makes\
    \ it slightly easier and cheaper to brute-\n   force the SHA2-256 hashes into\
    \ common and short local-parts, as\n   single rainbow tables [Rainbow] can be\
    \ reused across domains.  This\n   can be somewhat countered by using NSEC3 [RFC5155].\n\
    \   DNS zones that are signed with DNSSEC using NSEC [RFC4033] for denial\n  \
    \ of existence are susceptible to zone walking, a mechanism that allows\n   someone\
    \ to enumerate all the SMIMEA hashes in a zone.  This can be\n   used in combination\
    \ with previously hashed common or short local-\n   parts (in rainbow tables)\
    \ to deduce valid email addresses.  DNSSEC-\n   signed zones using NSEC3 for denial\
    \ of existence instead of NSEC are\n   significantly harder to brute-force after\
    \ performing a zone walk.\n"
