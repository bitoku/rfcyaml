  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) provides\
    \ the\n   administrative structure required to support the IETF standards\n  \
    \ process and to support the IETF's technical activities.  Within this\n   activity\
    \ is the office of the IETF Administrative Director (IAD) and\n   the IETF Administrative\
    \ Oversight Committee (IAOC).  In addition to\n   the ex-officio roles of the\
    \ IETF Chair and IAB Chair on this\n   committee, the IAB and IESG are each responsible\
    \ for the appointment\n   of one voting member of this committee.\n   This memo\
    \ outlines the process by which the IAB and IESG make their\n   selections.  This\
    \ process will also be used in the event of mid-term\n   vacancies that may arise\
    \ with these positions.\n   The document also provides guidance to the IETF Nominations\
    \ Committee\n   regarding desirable qualifications and selection criteria for\
    \ IAOC\n   candidates.\n   The same guidance may be used by the Internet Society\
    \ (ISOC) Board of\n   Trustees within its process of IAOC member appointment.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Overview of IAOC
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview of IAOC\n   The IASA is described in [RFC4071].  It is headed\
    \ by a full-time ISOC\n   employee, the IETF Administrative Director (IAD), an\
    \ officer\n   empowered to act on behalf of the IASA at the direction of the IAOC.\n\
    \   The IAOC's role is to provide appropriate direction to the IAD, to\n   review\
    \ the IAD's regular reports, and to oversee the IASA functions\n   to ensure that\
    \ the administrative needs of the IETF community are\n   being properly met. \
    \ The IAOC's mission is not to be engaged in the\n   day-to-day administrative\
    \ work of IASA, but rather to provide\n   appropriate direction, oversight, and\
    \ approval.\n   As described in [RFC4071], the IAOC's responsibilities are as\n\
    \   follows:\n   o  To select the IAD and provide high-level review and direction\
    \ for\n      his or her work.  This task should be handled by a sub-committee,\n\
    \      as described in [RFC4071].\n   o  To review the IAD's plans and contracts\
    \ to ensure that they will\n      meet the administrative needs of the IETF.\n\
    \   o  To track whether the IASA functions are meeting the IETF\n      community's\
    \ administrative needs, and to work with the IAD to\n      determine a plan for\
    \ corrective action if they are not.\n   o  To review the IAD's budget proposals\
    \ to ensure that they will meet\n      the IETF's needs, and review the IAD's\
    \ regular financial reports.\n   o  To ensure that the IASA is run in a transparent\
    \ and accountable\n      manner.  While the day-to-day work should be delegated\
    \ to the IAD\n      and others, the IAOC is responsible for ensuring that IASA\n\
    \      finances and operational status are tracked appropriately and that\n  \
    \    monthly, quarterly, and annual financial and operational reports\n      are\
    \ published to the IETF community.\n   o  To designate, in consultation with the\
    \ IAB and the IESG, the\n      person or people who carry out the tasks that other\
    \ IETF process\n      documents say are to be carried out by the IETF Executive\n\
    \      Director.\n   The IAOC's role is to direct and review, not perform, the\
    \ work of the\n   IAD and IASA.  The IAOC holds periodic teleconferences and\n\
    \   face-to-face meetings as needed to carry out the IAOC's duties\n   efficiently\
    \ and effectively.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.2.  Overview of Selection Process\n   In brief, this document describes the\
    \ time frame and procedures for\n   the IAB and IESG to solicit public input and\
    \ make a selection for the\n   position.\n"
- title: 2.  Desirable Qualifications and Selection Criteria for IETF-Nominated
  contents:
  - "2.  Desirable Qualifications and Selection Criteria for IETF-Nominated\n    IAOC\
    \ Members\n   The qualifications and selection criteria described in this section\n\
    \   shall be used by the IAB and IESG in selecting a suitably qualified\n   candidate\
    \ for the IAOC position.  As described in [RFC4071], the IETF\n   Nominations\
    \ Committee also has the responsibility to select IAOC\n   members, and the Nominations\
    \ Committee shall also use these desirable\n   qualifications and selection criteria\
    \ to guide its selection process.\n   The same guidance may be used by the ISOC\
    \ Board of Trustees within\n   its process of IAOC member appointment.\n   Candidates\
    \ for these IAOC positions should have knowledge of the\n   IETF, knowledge of\
    \ contracts and financial procedures, and\n   familiarity with the administrative\
    \ support needs of the IAB, the\n   IESG, and the IETF standards process.\n  \
    \ The candidates are also expected to be able to understand the\n   respective\
    \ roles and responsibilities of the IETF and ISOC in this\n   activity, and be\
    \ able to articulate these roles within the IETF\n   community.\n   The candidates\
    \ will also be expected to exercise all the duties of an\n   IAOC member, including\
    \ being prepared to undertake any associated\n   responsibilities.  These include,\
    \ but are not limited to, the setting\n   of administrative support policies,\
    \ oversight of the administrative\n   operations of the IETF, and representing\
    \ the interests of the IETF to\n   the IAOC.  The candidates must be able to undertake\
    \ full\n   participation in all committee meetings and committee activities.\n\
    \   In the case of the IAB-selected member of the IAOC, this individual\n   does\
    \ not directly represent the IAB.  Similarly for the IESG-selected\n   member\
    \ of the IAOC, this individual does not directly represent the\n   IESG.  The\
    \ IAB- and IESG-selected members are accountable directly to\n   the IETF community.\n\
    \   In the case of IAOC members selected by the IETF Nominations\n   Committee,\
    \ such members do not represent any particular sub-grouping\n   of IETF participants.\
    \  IETF Nominations Committee-selected IAOC\n   members are accountable directly\
    \ to the entire IETF community.\n"

    \ seat their selected committee member at\n   the first IETF meeting of every\
    \ second year, for a two-year term of\n   office.  The IAB and IESG will alternate\
    \ each year in undertaking a\n   selection, except for the initial selection.\
    \  For the first year, the\n   IAB and IESG will operate their selection process\
    \ concurrently.  Also\n   for the first year, the IESG-selected candidate will\
    \ serve on the\n   committee for an initial term ending with the first IETF meeting\
    \ of\n   the following year, and the IAB-selected candidate will serve for a\n\
    \   term one year longer than the IESG-selected candidate.  Thereafter,\n   the\
    \ candidates will be seated for two-year terms.\n   Basic time frame requirements\
    \ for the selection process are as\n   follows:\n   o  3-4 weeks for solicitation\
    \ of nominations.\n   o  3-4 weeks for review of nominees, deliberation, and selection.\n\
    \   In November of every year, the selecting body of that year will\n   announce\
    \ the specific dates for the selection process for that year,\n   following the\
    \ guidelines above.\n"

    \ the\n   appointed member is unable to serve the full two-year term, the\n  \
    \ selecting body may, at its discretion, immediately select a\n   replacement\
    \ to serve the remainder of the term using the interim\n   process defined in\
    \ Section 3.5.1.  If the selecting body does not\n   invoke the interim process,\
    \ the next regularly scheduled two-year\n   selection process will fill the vacancy.\n"
