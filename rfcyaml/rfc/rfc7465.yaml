  - "1.  Introduction\n   RC4 is a stream cipher that is described in [SCH]; it is
    widely\n   supported, and often preferred by TLS servers.  However, RC4 has long\n
    \  been known to have a variety of cryptographic weaknesses, e.g., see\n   [PAU],
    [MAN], and [FLU].  Recent cryptanalysis results [ALF] exploit\n   biases in the
    RC4 keystream to recover repeatedly encrypted\n   plaintexts.\n   These recent
    results are on the verge of becoming practically\n   exploitable; currently, they
    require 2^26 sessions or 13x2^30\n   encryptions.  As a result, RC4 can no longer
    be seen as providing a\n   sufficient level of security for TLS sessions.\n   This
    document requires that TLS ([RFC5246] [RFC4346] [RFC2246])\n   clients and servers
    never negotiate the use of RC4 cipher suites.\n"

      \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
      and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in
      [RFC2119].\n"
    title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Changes to TLS\n   Because of the RC4 deficiencies noted in Section 1, the
    following\n   apply:\n   o  TLS clients MUST NOT include RC4 cipher suites in
    the ClientHello\n      message.\n   o  TLS servers MUST NOT select an RC4 cipher
    suite when a TLS client\n      sends such a cipher suite in the ClientHello message.\n
    \  o  If the TLS client only offers RC4 cipher suites, the TLS server\n      MUST
    terminate the handshake.  The TLS server MAY send the\n      insufficient_security
    fatal alert in this case.\n   Appendix A lists the RC4 cipher suites defined for
    TLS.\n"
  title: 2.  Changes to TLS
- contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This document helps maintain the security guarantees
    of the TLS\n   protocol by prohibiting the use of the RC4-based cipher suites\n
    \  (listed in Appendix A), which do not provide a sufficiently high\n   level
    of security.\n"
