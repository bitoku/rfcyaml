    \ Mark Krilanovich     1\n         Official Change in Host-Host Protocol     \
    \        2\nThis is an official change to the Host to Host\nprotocol, this document\
    \ should be filed with the\nprotocol specification (nic -- 8246,) in the Current\n\
    Network Protocols Notebook (nic -- 7104,).                 3\n               \
    \                          -- Jon Postel    3a\nThis document corrects an ambiguity\
    \ in the current\nhost-host protocol, concerning the ERR command.\nParagraph \"\
    f\", page 35, of NIC 8246 defines the\nmeaning of an ERR command with error code\
    \ of 5 to be\n\"socket (link) not connected\".  The error code is\nstated to apply\
    \ to two cases, one in which a control\ncommand other than STR or RTS refers to\
    \ a socket that\nis neither fully open nor fully closed, and the other\nin which\
    \ a (non-control) message arrives over a link\nnot being used for a connection.\
    \                           4\nThe difficulty arises from the fact that the contents\n\
    of the \"data\" field of the ERR command has distinctly\ndifferent formats in\
    \ the two cases.  In the first, it\nis a host-host command, and in the second\
    \ it is a\nmessage header.  There is no reliable way for the code\nin the NCP\
    \ receiving the ERR command (or a human\nreviewing an error log) to distinguish\
    \ between the two\ncases, and therefore fullest use cannot be made of the\nERR\
    \ command.                                               5\nThe two cases are\
    \ now defined to have different error\ncodes.  In addition, a new error code is\
    \ defined,\nmeaning \"invalid host leader received\".  Therefore,\nparagraph \"\
    f\" under \"ERR - Error detected\" is now\nreplaced by the following:        \
    \                         6\nf.  Request on a non-open socket (Error code = 5)\
    \          7\fNWG/RFC# 695                       MCK 5-JUL-75 15:38  32908\nOfficial\
    \ Change in Host-Host Protocol\n   A request other than an STR or RTS was made\
    \ for a\n   socket (perhaps referenced by link number) that is\n   not party to\
    \ an fully established connection.  The\n   socket's inappropriate state could\
    \ either be that\n   only one RFC has been sent (not yet open) or that\n   only\
    \ one CLS has been sent (not yet closed).  The\n   \"data\" field contains the\
    \ command in error; the\n   value of any fill necessary is zeros.            \
    \      7a\ng.  Message on an unknown link (Error code = 6)            8\n   A\
    \ message was received over a user link which is\n   not currently being used\
    \ for any connection.  The\n   contents of the \"data\" field are the message\
    \ header\n   followed by the first eight bits of text, if any,\n   or zeros. \
    \                                             8a\nh.  Invalid host header (Error\
    \ code = 7)                   9\n   A message was received either over the control\
    \ link\n   or a valid user link that had a host header with\n   invalid format.\
    \ Examples of when this subtype would\n   be appropriate are the following:  the\
    \ M1 or M2\n   fields were non-zero, the byte size was invalid\n   (not 8 for\
    \ a control link, zero for any link), or\n   the declared length (byte size times\
    \ byte count)\n   exceeded the actual length.  The contents of the\n   \"data\"\
    \ field is the message header padded with\n   eight bits of zeros.           \
    \                        9a\n-------                                         \
