Abstract This document describes protocol options for conveying objects that have been protected using the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) version 3.1 over an X.400 message transfer system.
The techniques described in the Cryptographic Message Syntax [CMS] specification and message specifications can reasonably be transported via a variety of electronic mail systems.
This specification defines the options and values necessary to enable interoperable transport of S/MIME messages over an X.400 system.
This document describes a mechanism for using CMS objects as the message content of X.400 messages in a native X.400 environment.
This means that gateways or other functions that expect to deal with IPMS, such as those specified in [MIXER] and [BODYMAP], cannot do anything with these messages.
Note that cooperating S/MIME agents must support common forms of message content in order to achieve interoperability.
Definition of gateway services to support relay of CMS object between X.400 and SMTP environments is beyond the scope of this document.
The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [MUSTSHOULD].
Definitions For the purposes of this document, the following definitions apply.
Abstract Syntax Notation One, as defined in ISO/IEC 8824.
Object Identifier (OID): A globally unique identifier value consisting of a sequence of integer values assigned through distributed registration as specified by ISO/IEC 8824.
A reversible transformation made on data so 8 bit or binary data may be sent via a channel that only transmits 7 bit data.
It is a goal of this document to, if possible, maintain backward compatibility with existing X.400 implementations that employ S/MIME v3.1 wrappers.
This section reviews the X.400 message format.
An X.400 message has two parts, the envelope and the content, as described in X.402 [X.400]:
An information object whose composition varies from one transmittal step to another and that variously identifies the message's originator and potential recipients, documents its previous conveyance and directs its subsequent conveyance by the Message Transfer System (MTS), and characterizes its content.
The content is the piece of information that the originating User Agent wants to be delivered to one or more recipients.
The MTS neither examines nor modifies the content, except for conversion, during its conveyance of the message.
MTS conversion is not applicable to the scenario of this document because such conversion is incompatible with CMS protection mechanisms.
One piece of information borne by the envelope
identifies the type of the content.
The content type is an identifier (an ASN.1 OID or Integer) that denotes the syntax and semantics of the content overall.
This identifier enables the MTS to determine the message's deliverability to particular users, and enables User Agents and Message Stores to interpret and process the content.
Some X.400 content types further refine the structure of content as a set of heading elements and body parts.
An example of this is the Interpersonal Messaging System (IPMS).
The IPMS content structure is able to convey zero or more arbitrary body parts each identified by the body part type.
The body part type is an ASN.1 OID or Integer that denotes the syntax and semantics of the body part in question.
Carrying S/MIME as X.400 Content
When transporting a CMS protected message in X.400, the preferred approach (except as discussed in section 2.3 below) is to convey the object as X.400 message content.
This section describes how S/MIME CMS objects are conveyed as the content part of X.400 messages.
This mechanism is suitable for transport of CMS protected messages regardless of the mail content that has been encapsulated.
Implementations MUST include the CMS object in the content field of the X.400 message.
If the CMS object is covered by an outer MIME wrapper, the content  type field of the P1 envelope MUST be set to the following CMS  defined value:
} If the CMS object is not covered by an outer MIME wrapper, the content type field of the P1 envelope MUST be set to the following CMS defined value:
Carrying Plaintext MIME objects as X.400 Content
When transporting a plaintext MIME object in X.400, the preferred approach is to convey the object as X.400 message content.
The content type field of the P1 envelope MUST be set to the following CMS defined value:
Carrying S/MIME as IPMS Body Parts
Under some circumstances S/MIME CMS protected messages can be conveyed within select body parts of the content.
Implementations generally SHOULD NOT embed CMS objects within X.400 body parts, but should instead convey them as content as described in section 2.2.
Nevertheless, one notable exception is necessary for the case of forwarding.
In instances when CMS objects are forwarded as part of a message forwarding function, use of a body part is necessary.
When forwarding a CMS object in an IPMS or IPMS compatible body part, implementations MUST use the content body part as formally defined by [X.400], as shown below for reference.
content body part {ExtendedContentType:content type}
EXTENDED BODY PART TYPE ::
{ PARAMETERS {ForwardedContentParameters IDENTIFIED BY {
{joint iso itu t(2) mhs(6) ipms(1) ep(11)
{joint iso itu t(2) mhs(6) ipms(1) et(4)
} The implementation MUST copy the CMS object to be forwarded into the Content field of the content body part.
The direct reference field of the body part MUST include the OID formed by the concatenation of the id et content value and the following CMS defined value.
} For example, to forward any CMS object
the DATA component of the body part would be identified by { 2 6 1 4 17 1 2 840 113549 1 9 16 1 6 }.
The ForwardedContentParameters are optional and MAY be supported at the discretion of the implementor.
The OID value id et content MAY also be included in the original encoded information types field of the X.400 message envelope at the discretion of the sending S/MIME agent.
In this instance, the content type field of the P1 envelope MUST be set to the value associate with the forwarding content (e.g., integer 22 for IPMS).
According to various S/MIME specifications for message wrapping, CMS objects MAY optionally be wrapped in MIME to dynamically support 7  bit transport.
This outer wrapping is not required for X.400 transport, and generally SHOULD NOT be applied in a homogeneous X.400 environment.
Heterogeneous mail systems or other factors MAY require the presence of this outer MIME wrapper 2.5.
In [MSG], the application/pkcs7 mime content type and optional "smime type" parameter are used to convey details about the security applied (signed or enveloped) along with information about the contained content.
This may aid receiving S/MIME implementations in correctly processing the secured content.
Additional values of smime type are defined in [ESS].
In an X.400 transport environment, MIME typing is not available.
Therefore the equivalent semantic is conveyed using the Encoded Information Types (EITs).
The EITs are conveyed in the original encoded information types field of the X.400 message envelope.
This memo defines the following smime types.
Receiving agents SHOULD recognize S/MIME OID values in the EITs field, and process the message appropriately according to local procedures.
In order that consistency can be obtained in future S/MIME EIT assignments, the following guidelines should be followed when assigning new EIT values.
Values assigned for S/MIME EITs should correspond to assigned smime type values on a one to one basis.
The restrictions of section 3.2.2 of [MSG] therefore apply.
S/MIME EIT values may coexist with other EIT values intended to further qualify the makeup of the protected content.
The enveloped data EIT indicates that the X.400 content field contains a MIME type that has been protected by the CMS enveloped  data content type in accordance with [MSG].
The resulting enveloped data CMS content is conveyed in accordance with section 2.2.
This EIT should be indicated by the following OID value:
The signed data EIT indicates that the X.400 content field contains a MIME type that has been protected by the CMS signed data content type in accordance with [MSG].
The resulting signed data CMS content is conveyed in accordance with section 2.2.
This EIT should be indicated by the following OID value:
Only The certs only message is used to transport certificates and/or CRLs, such as in response to a registration request.
This is described in [CERT31].
The certs only message consists of a single instance of CMS content of type signed data.
The encapContentInfo eContent field MUST be absent and signerInfos field MUST be empty.
The resulting certs only CMS content is conveyed in accordance with section 2.2.
This EIT should be indicated by the following OID value:
id eit certsOnly(3) } 2.5.4.
The signed receipt EIT indicates that the X.400 content field contains a Receipt content that has been protected by the CMS signed data content type in accordance with [ESS].
The resulting CMS signed data content is conveyed in accordance with section 2.2.
This EIT should be indicated by the following OID value: id eit signedReceipt
id eit signedReceipt(4) } 2.5.5.
The enveloped X.400 EIT indicates that the X.400 content field contains X.400 content that has been protected by the CMS enveloped  data content type in accordance with [X400WRAP].
The resulting enveloped X.400 CMS content is conveyed in accordance with section 2.2.
This EIT should be indicated by the following OID value:
id eit envelopedX400(5) } 2.5.6.
The signed X.400 EIT indicates that the X.400 content field contains X.400 content that has been protected by the CMS signed data content type in accordance with [X400WRAP].
The resulting signed X.400 CMS content is conveyed in accordance with section 2.2.
This EIT should be indicated by the following OID value:
id eit signedX400(6) } 2.5.7.
The compressed data EIT indicates that the X.400 content field contains a another type that has been compressed by the compressed  data content type in accordance with [COMPRESS].
The resulting CMS content is conveyed in accordance with section 2.2.
This EIT should be indicated by the following OID value:
id eit compressedData(7) } 2.6.
Interaction with X.400 Elements of Service Care should be taken in the selection of X.400 services to be used in conjunction with CMS objects.
Services affecting conversion of the content, expansion of Distribution Lists (DLs), and message redirection can interact badly with services provided by the "EnvelopedData" and "SignedData" CMS content types.
MTS Conversion Services MTS conversion is not applicable to the scenario of this document because such conversion is incompatible with CMS protection mechanisms.
X.400 systems that implement conversion services should generally be unable to attempt conversion of CMS content types because those types do not conform to X.420 structure rules.
Nevertheless, when transporting CMS objects within an X.400 environment, the Conversion Prohibition service SHOULD be selected.
Message Redirection Services X.400 message redirection services can have an indirect impact on the application of the CMS "EnvelopedData" content type.
Several different forms of redirection are possible in X.400, including:  Originator Requested Alternate Recipient (ORAR)  Alternate Recipient Assignment
In addition, any auto forwarding services that are not security aware may share the same problem.
An auto forwarding implementation that removes the EnvelopedData and reapplies it for the forwarded recipient is not affected by this problem.
The normal case is that the private key is not available when the human user is not present, thus decryption is not possible.
However, if the private key is present, forwarding can be used instead.
When the "EnvelopedData" content type is used to protect message contents, an instance of RecipientInfo is needed for each recipient and alternate recipient in order to ensure the desired access to the message.
A RecipientInfo for the originator is a good practice just in case the MTS returns the whole message.
In the event that ORAR is used, the originator is aware of the identity of the alternate recipient and SHOULD include a corresponding RecipientInfo element.
For other forms of redirection (including non security aware auto forwarding)
the alternate recipient must either have access to the intended recipient's keys (not recommended) or must relay the message to the intended recipient by other means.
DL Expansion X.400 DLs can have an indirect impact on the application of the CMS "EnvelopedData" content type.
When the "EnvelopedData" content type is used to protect message contents, an instance of RecipientInfo is needed for each recipient in order to ensure the desired access to the message.
Messages to a DL would typically include only a single RecipientInfo associated with the DL.
Unlike Mail Lists (MLs) described in [ESS], however, X.400 DLs are not generally security  aware and do not regenerate RecipientInfo elements for the DL members.
It is recommended that a security aware ML conforming to [ESS] be used in preference to X.400 DLs.
When transporting CMS objects within an X.400 environment, the DL Expansion Prohibited service SHOULD be selected.
This specification introduces no new security concerns to the CMS or S/MIME models.
Security issues are identified in section 5 of [MSG], section 6 of [ESS] and the Security Considerations section of [CMS].
