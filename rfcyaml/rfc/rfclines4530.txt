Abstract This document describes the LDAP/X.500 'entryUUID' operational attribute and associated matching rules and syntax.
The attribute holds a server assigned Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the object.
Directory clients may use this attribute to distinguish objects identified by a distinguished name or to locate an object after renaming.
In X.500 Directory Services [X.501], such as those accessible using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
[RFC4510], an object is identified by its distinguished name (DN).
However, DNs are not stable identifiers.
That is, a new object may be identified by a DN that previously identified another (now renamed or deleted) object.
A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is "an identifier unique across both space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs" [RFC4122].
UUIDs are used in a wide range of systems.
This document describes the 'entryUUID' operational attribute, which holds the UUID assigned to the object by the server.
Clients may use this attribute to distinguish objects identified by a particular distinguished name or to locate a particular object after renaming.
This document defines the UUID syntax, the 'uuidMatch' and 'uuidOrderingMatch' matching rules, and the 'entryUUID' attribute type.
Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats [RFC4512].
Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for readability.
In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
UUID Syntax A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)
[RFC4122] is a 16 octet (128  bit) value that identifies an object.
The ASN.1 [X.680] type UUID is defined to represent UUIDs as follows:
In LDAP, UUID values are encoded using the [ASCII] character string representation described in [RFC4122].
For example, "597ae2f6 16a6 1027 98f4 d28b5365dc14".
The following is an LDAP syntax description suitable for publication in subschema subentries.
( 1.3.6.1.1.16.1 DESC 'UUID' )
The 'uuidMatch' matching rule compares an asserted UUID with a stored UUID for equality.
Its semantics are the same as the 'octetStringMatch' [X.520][RFC4517] matching rule.
The rule differs from 'octetStringMatch' in that the assertion value is encoded using the UUID string representation instead of the normal OCTET STRING string representation.
The following is an LDAP matching rule description suitable for publication in subschema subentries.
( 1.3.6.1.1.16.2 NAME 'uuidMatch' SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.1.16.1 ) 2.3.
The 'uuidOrderingMatch' matching rule compares an asserted UUID with a stored UUID for ordering.
Its semantics are the same as the 'octetStringOrderingMatch' [X.520][RFC4517] matching rule.
The rule differs from 'octetStringOrderingMatch' in that the assertion value is encoded using the UUID string representation instead of the normal OCTET STRING string representation.
The following is an LDAP matching rule description suitable for publication in subschema subentries.
( 1.3.6.1.1.16.3 NAME 'uuidOrderingMatch' SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.1.16.1 )
Note that not all UUID variants have a defined ordering; and even where it does, servers are not obligated to assign UUIDs in any particular order.
This matching rule is provided for completeness.
'entryUUID' Attribute The 'entryUUID' operational attribute provides the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) assigned to the entry.
The following is an LDAP attribute type description suitable for publication in subschema subentries.

NO USER MODIFICATION USAGE directoryOperation )
Servers SHALL generate and assign a new UUID to each entry upon its addition to the directory and provide that UUID as the value of the 'entryUUID' operational attribute.
An entry's UUID is immutable.
UUID are to be generated in accordance with Section 4 of [RFC4122].
In particular, servers MUST ensure that each generated UUID is unique in space and time.
An entry's relative distinguish name (RDN) is composed from attribute values of the entry, which are commonly descriptive of the object the entry represents.
Although deployers are encouraged to use naming attributes whose values are widely disclosable
[RFC4514], entries are often named using information that cannot be disclosed to all parties.
As UUIDs do not contain any descriptive information of the object they identify, UUIDs may be used to identify a particular entry without disclosure of its contents.
General UUID security considerations [RFC4122] apply.
General LDAP security considerations [RFC4510] apply.
The IANA has registered the LDAP values [RFC4520] specified in this document.
