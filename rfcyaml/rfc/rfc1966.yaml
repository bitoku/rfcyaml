  - "Abstract\n   The Border Gateway Protocol [1] is an inter-autonomous system routing\n\
    \   protocol designed for TCP/IP internets. BGP deployments are\n   configured\
    \ such that that all BGP speakers within a single AS must be\n   fully meshed\
    \ so that any external routing information must be re-\n   distributed to all\
    \ other routers within that AS. This represents a\n   serious scaling problem\
    \ that has been well documented with several\n   alternatives proposed [2,3].\n\
    \   This document describes the use and design of a method known as\n   \"Route\
    \ Reflection\" to alleviate the the need for \"full mesh\" IBGP.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Currently in the Internet, BGP deployments are configured\
    \ such that\n   that all BGP speakers within a single AS must be fully meshed\
    \ and any\n   external routing information must be re-distributed to all other\n\
    \   routers within that AS. This \"full mesh\" requirement clearly does not\n\
    \   scale when there are a large number of IBGP speakers as is common in\n   many\
    \ of todays internet networks.\n   For n BGP speakers within an AS you must maintain\
    \ n*(n-1)/2 unique\n   IBGP sessions. With finite resources in both bandwidth\
    \ and router CPU\n   this clearly does not scale.\n   This scaling problem has\
    \ been well documented and a number of\n   proposals have been made to alleviate\
    \ this [2,3]. This document\n   represents another alternative in alleviating\
    \ the need for a \"full\n   mesh\" and is known as \"Route Reflection\". It represents\
    \ a change in\n   the commonly understood concept of IBGP and the addition of\
    \ two new\n   optional transitive BGP attributes.\n"
- title: 2.  Design Criteria
  contents:
  - "2.  Design Criteria\n   Route Reflection was designed to satisfy the following\
    \ criteria.\n           o Simplicity\n             Any alternative must be both\
    \ simple to configure as well\n             as understand.\n           o Easy\
    \ Migration\n             It must be possible to migrate from a full mesh\n  \
    \           configuration without the need to change either topology\n       \
    \      or AS. This is an unfortunate management overhead of the\n            \
    \ technique proposed in [3].\n           o Compatibility\n             It must\
    \ be possible for non compliant IBGP peers\n             to continue be part of\
    \ the original AS or domain\n             without any loss of BGP routing information.\n\
    \   These criteria were motivated by operational experiences of a very\n   large\
    \ and topology rich network with many external connections.\n"

    \                         Figure 1: Full Mesh IBGP\n   In ASX there are three\
    \ IBGP speakers (routers RTR-A, RTR-B and RTR-\n   C).  With the existing BGP\
    \ model, if RTR-A receives an external route\n   and it is selected as the best\
    \ path it must advertise the external\n   route to both RTR-B and RTR-C. RTR-B\
    \ and RTR-C (as IBGP speakers)\n   will not re-advertise these IBGP learned routes\
    \ to other IBGP\n   speakers.\n   If this rule is relaxed and RTR-C is allowed\
    \ to reflect IBGP learned\n   routes, then it could re-advertise (or reflect)\
    \ the IBGP routes\n   learned from RTR-A to RTR-B and vice versa. This would eliminate\

  - "4.  Terminology and Concepts\n   We use the term \"Route Reflector\" (RR) to\
    \ represent an IBGP speaker\n   that participates in the reflection.  The internal\
    \ peers of a RR are\n   divided into two groups:\n           1) Client Peers\n\
    \           2) Non-Client Peers\n   A RR reflects routes between these groups.\
    \  A RR along with its\n   client peers form a Cluster. The Non-Client peer must\
    \ be fully meshed\n   but the Client peers need not be fully meshed. The Client\
    \ peers\n   should not peer with internal speakers outside of their cluster.\n\

- title: 5. Operation
  contents:
  - "5. Operation\n   When a route is received by a RR, it selects the best path based\
    \ on\n   its path selection rule. After the best path is selected, it must do\n\
    \   the following depending on the type of the peer it is receiving the\n   best\
    \ path from:\n           1) A Route from a Non-Client peer\n              Reflect\
    \ to all other Clients.\n           2) A Route from a Client peer\n          \
    \    Reflect to all the Non-Client peers and also to the\n              Client\
    \ peers other than the originator. (Hence the\n              Client peers are\
    \ not required to be fully meshed).\n            3) Route from an EBGP peer\n\
    \               Send to all the Client and Non-Client Peers.\n   An Autonomous\
    \ System could have many RRs. A RR treats other RRs just\n   like any other internal\
    \ BGP speakers. A RR could be configured to\n   have other RRs in a Client group\
    \ or Non-client group.\n   In a simple configuration the backbone could be divided\
    \ into many\n   clusters.  Each RR would be configured with other RRs as Non-Client\n\
    \   peers (thus all the RRs will be fully meshed.). The Clients will be\n   configured\
    \ to maintain IBGP session only with the RR in their\n   cluster.  Due to route\
    \ reflection, all the IBGP speakers will receive\n   reflected routing information.\n\
    \   It is normal in a Autonomous System to have BGP speakers that do not\n   understand\
    \ the concept of Route-Reflectors (let us call them\n   conventional BGP speakers).\
    \ The Route-Reflector Scheme allows such\n   conventional BGP speakers to co-exist.\
    \ Conventional BGP speakers ould\n   be either members of a Non-Client group or\
    \ a Client group. This\n   allows for an easy and gradual migration from the current\
    \ IBGP model\n   to the Route Reflection model. One could start creating clusters\
    \ by\n   configuring a single router as the designated RR and configuring\n  \
    \ other RRs and their clients as normal IBGP peers. Additional clusters\n   can\
    \ be created gradually.\n"
- title: 6.  Redundant RRs
  contents:
  - "6.  Redundant RRs\n   Usually a cluster of clients will have a single RR. In\
    \ that case, the\n   cluster will be identified by the ROUTER_ID of the RR. However,\
    \ this\n   represents a single point of failure so to make it possible to have\n\
    \   multiple RRs in the same cluster, all RRs in the same cluster must be\n  \
    \ configured with a 4-byte CLUSTER_ID so that an RR can discern routes\n   from\
    \ other RRs in the same cluster.\n"
- title: 7.  Avoiding Routing Information Loops
  contents:
  - "7.  Avoiding Routing Information Loops\n   As IBGP learned routes are reflected,\
    \ it is possible through mis-\n   configuration to form route re-distribution\
    \ loops. The Route\n   Reflection method defines the following attributes to detect\
    \ and\n   avoid routing information loops.\n   ORIGINATOR_ID\n   ORIGINATOR_ID\
    \ is a new optional, non-transitive BGP attribute of Type\n   code 9.  This attribute\
    \ is 4 bytes long and it will be created by a\n   RR. This attribute will carry\
    \ the ROUTER_ID of the originator of the\n   route in the local AS. A BGP speaker\
    \ should not create an\n   ORIGINATOR_ID attribute if one already exists.  A route\
    \ reflector\n   must never send routing information back to the router specified\
    \ in\n   ORIGINATOR_ID.\n   CLUSTER_LIST\n   Cluster-list is a new optional, non-transitive\
    \ BGP attribute of Type\n   code 10. It is a sequence of CLUSTER_ID values representing\
    \ the\n   reflection path that the route has passed. It is encoded as follows:\n\
    \              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3\n     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \     |  Attr. Flags  |Attr. Type Code|   Length      | value ...\n     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   Where Length is the number of octets.\n   When a RR reflects a route from\
    \ its Clients to a Non-Client peer, it\n   must append the local CLUSTER_ID to\
    \ the CLUSTER_LIST. If the\n   CLUSTER_LIST is empty, it must create a new one.\
    \ Using this attribute\n   an RR can identify if the routing information is looped\
    \ back to the\n   same cluster due to mis-configuration. If the local CLUSTER_ID\
    \ is\n   found in the cluster-list, the advertisement will be ignored.\n"
- title: 8.  Implementation and Configuration Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Implementation and Configuration Considerations\n   Care should be taken\
    \ to make sure that none of the BGP path\n   attributes defined above can be modified\
    \ through configuration when\n   exchanging internal routing information between\
    \ RRs and Clients and\n   Non-Clients. This could result is looping of routes.\n\
    \   In some implementations, modification of the BGP path attribute,\n   NEXT_HOP\
    \ is possible. For example, there could be a need for a RR to\n   modify NEXT_HOP\
    \ for EBGP learned routes sent to its internal peers.\n   However, it must not\
    \ be possible for an RR to set on reflected IBGP\n   routes as this breaks the\
    \ basic principle of Route Reflection and\n   will result in potential black holeing\
    \ of traffic.\n   An RR should not modify any AS-PATH attributes (i.e. LOCAL_PREF,\
    \ MED,\n   DPA)that could change consistent route selection. This could result\n\
    \   in potential loops.\n   The BGP protocol provides no way for a Client to identify\
    \ itself\n   dynamically as a Client to an RR configured BGP speaker and the\n\
    \   simplest way to achieve this is by manual configuration.\n"
