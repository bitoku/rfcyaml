  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The XML 1.0 Recommendation [XML] describes the syntax of\
    \ a class of\n   data objects called XML documents. The mission of this working\
    \ group\n   is to develop a XML syntax used for representing signatures on\n \
    \  digital content and procedures for computing and verifying such\n   signatures.\
    \  Signatures will provide data integrity, authentication,\n   and/or non-repudiability.\n\
    \   This document lists the design principles, scope, and requirements\n   over\
    \ three things: (1) the scope of work available to the WG, (2) the\n   XML signature\
    \ specification, and (3) applications that implement the\n   specification. It\
    \ includes requirements as they relate to the\n   signature syntax, data model,\
    \ format, cryptographic processing, and\n   external requirements and coordination.\
    \ Those things that are\n   required are designated as \"must\", those things\
    \ that are optional are\n   designated by \"may\", those things that are optional\
    \ but recommended\n   are designated as \"should\".\n"
- title: 2. Design Principles and Scope
  contents:
  - "2. Design Principles and Scope\n   1. The specification must describe how to\
    \ sign digital content, and\n      XML content in particular. The XML syntax used\
    \ to represent a\n      signature (over any content) is described as an XML Signature.\n\
    \      [Charter]\n   2. XML Signatures are generated from a hash over the canonical\
    \ form\n      of a signature manifest. (In this document we use the term\n   \
    \   manifest to mean a collection of references to the objects being\n      signed.\
    \ The specifications may use the terms manifest, package or\n      other terms\
    \ differently from this document while still meeting\n      this requirement.)\
    \ The manifest must support references to Web\n      resources, the hash of the\
    \ resource content (or its canonicalized\n      form), and (optionally) the resource\
    \ content type. [Brown,\n      List(Solo)] Web resources are defined as any digital\
    \ content that\n      can be addressed using the syntax of XLink locator [XLink]).\n\
    \   3. The meaning of a signature is simple:  The XML Signature syntax\n     \
    \ associates the content of resources listed in a manifest with a\n      key via\
    \ a strong one-way transformation.\n      1. The XML Signature syntax must be\
    \ extensible such that it can\n         support arbitrary application/trust semantics\
    \ and assertion\n         capabilities -- that can also be signed.\n         [Charter(Requirement1&4),\
    \ List(Bugbee, Solo)]\n      2. The WG is not chartered to specify trust semantics,\
    \ but syntax\n         and processing rules necessary for communicating signature\n\
    \         validity (authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation).\n         [Charter(Requirement1)]\
    \ At the Chairs' discretion and in order\n         to test the extensibility of\
    \ the syntax, the WG may produce\n         non-critical-path proposals defining\
    \ common semantics (e.g.,\n         manifest, package, timestamps, endorsement,\
    \ etc.) relevant to\n         signed assertions about Web resources in a schema\
    \ definition\n         [XML, RDF] or link type definition [XLink].\n      Comment:\
    \ A more formal definition of a signed resource is below.\n      The notation\
    \ is \"definition(inputs):constraints\" where definition\n      evaluates as true\
    \ for the given inputs and specified constraints.\n      signed-resource(URI-of-resource,\
    \ content, key, signature): (there\n      was some protocol message at a specific\
    \ time such that \"GET(URI-\n      of-resource) = content\") AND (sign-doc(content,\
    \ key, sig))\n      sign-doc(content, key, signature): signature is the value\
    \ of a\n      strong one-way transformation over content and key that yields\n\
    \      content integrity/validity and/or key non-repudiability\n   4. The specification\
    \ must not specify methods of confidentiality\n      though the Working Group\
    \ may report on the feasibility of such\n      work in a future or rechartered\
    \ activity. [List(Bugbee)]\n   5. The specification must only require the provision\
    \ of key\n      information essential to checking the validity of the\n      cryptographic\
    \ signature. For instance, identity and key recovery\n      information might\
    \ be of interest to particular applications, but\n      they are not within the\
    \ class of required information defined in\n      this specification. [List(Reagle)]\n\
    \   6. The specification must define or reference at least one method of\n   \
    \   canonicalizing and hashing the signature syntax (i.e., the\n      manifest\
    \ and signature blocks). [Oslo] The specification must not\n      specify methods\
    \ of canonicalizing resource content [Charter],\n      though it may specify security\
    \ requirements over such methods.\n      [Oslo] Such content is normalized by\
    \ specifying an appropriate\n      content C14N (canonicalization) algorithm [DOMHASH,\
    \ XML-C14N].\n      Applications are expected to normalize application specific\n\
    \      semantics prior to handing data to a XML Signature application or\n   \
    \   specify the necessary transformations for this process within the\n      signature.\
    \  [Charter]\n   7. XML Signature applications must be conformant with the\n \
    \     specifications as follows:\n      1. XML-namespaces [XML-namespaces] within\
    \ its own signature\n         syntax. Applications may choose C14N algorithms\
    \ which do or do\n         not process namespaces within XML content. For instance,\
    \ some\n         C14N algorithms may opt to remove all namespace declarations,\n\
    \         others may rewrite namespace declarations to provide for\n         context\
    \ independent declarations within every element.\n      2. XLink [Xlink] within\
    \ its own signature syntax. For any resource\n         identification beyond simple\
    \ URIs (without fragment IDs) or\n         fragmentIDs, applications must use\
    \ XLink locators to reference\n         signed resources. Signature applications\
    \ must not embed or\n         expand XLink references in signed content, though\
    \ applications\n         may choose C14N algorithms which provide this feature.\n\
    \      3. XML-Pointers [XPointer] within its own signature syntax. If\n      \
    \   applications reference/select parts of XML documents, they must\n        \
    \ use XML-Pointer within an XLink locator.  [WS-list(1)]\n      The WG may specify\
    \ security requirements that constrain the\n      operation of these dependencies\
    \ to ensure consistent and secure\n      signature generation and operation. [Oslo]\n\
    \   8. XML Signatures must be developed as part of the broader Web design\n  \
    \    philosophy of decentralization, URIs, Web data,\n      modularity/layering/extensibility,\
    \ and assertions as statements\n      about statements. [Berners-Lee, WebData]\
    \ In this context, existing\n      cryptographic provider (and infrastructure)\
    \ primitives should be\n      taken advantage of. [List(Solo)]\n"

- title: 3.1 Signature Data Model and Syntax
  contents:
  - "3.1 Signature Data Model and Syntax\n   1. XML Signature data structures must\
    \ be based on the RDF data model\n      [RDF] but need not use the RDF serialization\
    \ syntax. [Charter]\n   2. XML Signatures apply to any resource addressable by\
    \ a locator --\n      including non-XML content. XML Signature referents are identified\n\
    \      with XML locators (URIs or fragments) within the manifest that\n      refer\
    \ to external or internal resources (i.e., network accessible\n      or within\
    \ the same XML document/package). [Berners-Lee, Brown,\n      List(Vincent), WS,\
    \ XFDL]\n   3. XML Signatures must be able to apply to a part or totality of a\n\
    \      XML document.  [Charter, Brown] Comment: A related requirement\n      under\
    \ consideration is requiring the specification to support the\n      ability to\
    \ indicate those portions of a document one signs via\n      exclusion of those\
    \ portions one does not wish to sign. This\n      feature allows one to create\
    \ signatures that have document closure\n      [List(Boyer(1)], retain ancestor\
    \ information, and retain element\n      order of non-continuous regions that\
    \ must be signed. We are\n      considering implementing this requirement via\
    \ (1) a special\n      <dsig:exclude> element, (2) an exclude list accompanying\
    \ the\n      resource locator, or (3) the XML-Fragment or XPointer\n      specifications\
    \ -- or a requested change to those specifications if\n      the functionality\
    \ is not available. See List(Boyer(1,2)) for\n      further discussion of this\
    \ issue.\n   4. Multiple XML Signatures must be able to exist over the static\n\
    \      content of a Web resource given varied keys, content\n      transformations,\
    \ and algorithm specifications (signature, hash,\n      canonicalization, etc.).\
    \ [Charter, Brown]\n   5. XML Signatures are first class objects themselves and\
    \ consequently\n      must be able to be referenced and signed. [Berners-Lee]\n\
    \   6. The specification must permit the use of varied digital signature\n   \
    \   and message authentication codes, such as symmetric and asymmetric\n     \
    \ authentication schemes as well as dynamic agreement of keying\n      material.\
    \ [Brown] Resource or algorithm identifier are a first\n      class objects, and\
    \ must be addressable by a URI. [Berners-Lee]\n   7. XML Signatures must be able\
    \ to apply to the original version of an\n      included/encoded resource. [WS-list\
    \ (Brown/Himes)]\n"
- title: 3.2 Format
  contents:
  - "3.2 Format\n   1. An XML Signature must be an XML element (as defined by production\n\
    \      39 of the XML1.0 specification. [XML])\n   2. When XML signatures are placed\
    \ within a document the operation\n      must preserve (1) the document's root\
    \ element tag as root and (2)\n      the root's descendancy tree except for the\
    \ addition of signature\n      element(s) in places permitted by the document's\
    \ content model.\n      For example, an XML form, when signed, should still be\n\
    \      recognizable as a XML form to its application after it has been\n     \
    \ signed. [WS-summary]\n   3. XML Signature must provide a mechanism that facilitates\
    \ the\n      production of composite documents -- by addition or deletion --\n\
    \      while preserving the signature characteristics (integrity,\n      authentication,\
    \ and non-repudiability) of the consituent parts.\n      [Charter, Brown, List(Bugbee)]\n\
    \   4. An important use of XML Signatures will be detached Web\n      signatures.\
    \ However, signatures may be embedded within or\n      encapsulate XML or encoded\
    \ content. [Charter] This WG must specify\n      a simple method of packaging\
    \ and encapsulation if no W3C\n      Recommendation is available.\n"
- title: 3.3 Cryptography and Processing
  contents:
  - "3.3 Cryptography and Processing\n   1. The specification must permit arbitrary\
    \ cryptographic signature\n      and message authentication algorithms, symmetric\
    \ and asymmetric\n      authentication schemes, and key agreement methods. [Brown]\n\
    \   2. The specification must specify at least one mandatory to implement\n  \
    \    signature canonicalization, content canonicalization, hash, and\n      signature\
    \ algorithm.\n   3. In the event of redundant attributes within the XML Signature\n\
    \      syntax and relevant cryptographic blobs, XML Signature\n      applications\
    \ prefer the XML Signature semantics.  Comment: Another\n      possibility is\
    \ that an error should be generated, however it isn't\n      where a conflict\
    \ will be flagged between the various function and\n      application layers regardless.\n\
    \   4. The signature design and specification text must not permit\n      implementers\
    \ to erroneously build weak implementations susceptible\n      to common security\
    \ weaknesses (such as as downgrade or algorithm\n      substitution attacks).\n"
- title: 3.4 Coordination
  contents:
  - "3.4 Coordination\n   1. The XML Signature specification should meet the requirements\
    \ of\n      the following applications:\n         1. Internet Open Trading Protocol\
    \ v1.0 [IOTP]\n         2. Financial Services Mark Up Language v2.0 [Charter]\n\

    \ does not \"identify non-contiguous portions of\n      a document in such a way\
    \ that the relative positions of the\n      connected components is preserved\"\
    . Packaging is a capability\n      critical to XML Signature applications, but\
