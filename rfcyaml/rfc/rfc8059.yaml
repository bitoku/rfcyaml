- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The construction of multicast distribution trees where the\
    \ root and\n   receivers are located in different LISP sites [RFC6830] is defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC6831].  Creation of (root-EID,G) state in the root site requires\n\
    \   that unicast LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune messages be sent from an\n   ETR\
    \ on the receiver site to an ITR on the root site.  The term \"EID\"\n   is short\
    \ for \"Endpoint ID\".\n   [RFC6831] specifies that (root-EID,G) data packets\
    \ are to be LISP-\n   encapsulated into (root-RLOC,G) multicast packets.  However,\
    \ a wide\n   deployment of multicast connectivity between LISP sites is unlikely\n\
    \   to happen any time soon.  In fact, some implementations are initially\n  \
    \ focusing on unicast transport with head-end replication between root\n   and\
    \ receiver sites.\n   The unicast LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune message specifies\
    \ the\n   (root-EID,G) state that needs to be established in the root site, but\n\
    \   conveys nothing about the receiver's capability or desire to use\n   multicast\
    \ as the underlying transport.  This document specifies a\n   Join/Prune attribute\
    \ that allows the receiver ETR to select the\n   desired transport.\n   The term\
    \ \"transport\" in this document is intentionally somewhat\n   vague.  Currently,\
    \ it is used just to indicate whether multicast or\n   head-end replication is\
    \ used; this means that the outer destination\n   address is either a unicast\
    \ or multicast address.  Future documents\n   may specify how other types of delivery,\
    \ encapsulation, or underlay\n   are used.\n   Knowledge of the receiver ETR's\
    \ RLOC address is essential to the\n   control plane of the root ITR.  The RLOC\
    \ address determines the\n   downstream destination for unicast head-end replication\
    \ and\n   identifies the receiver ETR that needs to be notified should the root\n\
    \   ITR of the distribution tree move to another site.  The root ITR can\n   change\
    \ when the source EID is roaming to another LISP site.\n   Service providers may\
    \ implement unicast reverse path forwarding\n   (uRPF) policies requiring that\
    \ the outer source address of the LISP-\n   encapsulated Join/Prune message be\
    \ the address of the receiver ETR's\n   core-facing interface used to physically\
    \ transmit the message.\n   However, due to policy and load-balancing considerations,\
    \ the outer\n   source address may not be the RLOC on which the receiver site\
    \ wishes\n   to receive a particular flow.  This document specifies a Join/Prune\n\
    \   attribute that conveys the appropriate receiver ETR's RLOC address to\n  \
    \ the control plane of the root ITR.\n   This document uses terminology defined\
    \ in [RFC6830], such as EID,\n   RLOC, ITR, and ETR.\n"

- title: 3.  PIM Join/Prune Attributes
  contents:
  - "3.  PIM Join/Prune Attributes\n   PIM Join/Prune attributes are defined in [RFC5384]\
    \ by introducing a\n   new Encoded-Source type that, in addition to the Join/Prune\
    \ source,\n   can carry multiple Type-Length-Value (TLV) attributes.  These\n\
    \   attributes apply to the individual Join/Prune sources on which they\n   are\
    \ stored.\n   The attributes defined in this document conform to the format of\
    \ the\n   encoding type defined in [RFC5384].  The attributes would typically\n\
    \   be the same for all the sources in the Join/Prune message.  Hence, we\n  \
    \ RECOMMEND using the hierarchical Join/Prune attribute scheme defined\n   in\
    \ [RFC7887].  This hierarchical system allows attributes to be\n   conveyed in\
    \ the Upstream Neighbor Address field, thus enabling the\n   efficient application\
    \ of a single attribute instance to all the\n   sources in the Join/Prune message.\n\
    \   LISP Tunnel Routers (xTRs) do not exchange PIM Hello Messages, and\n   hence\
    \ no Hello option is defined to negotiate support for these\n   attributes.  Systems\
    \ that support unicast head-end replication are\n   assumed to support these attributes.\n"
- title: 4.  The Transport Attribute
  contents:
  - "4.  The Transport Attribute\n   It is essential that a mechanism be provided\
    \ by which the desired\n   transport can be conveyed by receiver sites.  Root\
    \ sites with\n   multicast connectivity will want to leverage multicast replication.\n\
    \   However, not all receiver sites can be expected to have multicast\n   connectivity.\
    \  It is thus desirable that root sites be prepared to\n   support (root-EID,G)\
    \ state with a mixture of multicast and unicast\n   output state.  This document\
    \ specifies a Join/Prune attribute that\n   allows the receiver to select the\
    \ desired underlying transport.\n"

- title: 5.  Receiver ETR RLOC Attribute
  contents:
  - "5.  Receiver ETR RLOC Attribute\n   When a receiver ETR requests unicast head-end\
    \ replication for a given\n   (root-EID,G) entry, the PIM control plane of the\
    \ root ITR must\n   maintain an outgoing interface list (\"oif-list\") entry for\
    \ the\n   receiver ETR and its corresponding RLOC address.  This allows the\n\
    \   root ITR to perform unicast LISP-encapsulation of multicast data\n   packets\
    \ to each and every receiver ETR that has requested unicast\n   head-end replication.\n\
    \   The PIM control plane of the root ITR could potentially determine the\n  \
    \ RLOC address of the receiver ETR from the outer source address field\n   of\
    \ the LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune message.  However, receiver ETRs\n   are subject\
    \ to uRPF checks by the network providers on each core-\n   facing interface.\
    \  The outer source address must therefore be the\n   RLOC of the core-facing\
    \ interface used to physically transmit the\n   LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune message.\
    \  Due to policy and load-\n   balancing considerations, that may not be the RLOC\
    \ on which the\n   receiver site wishes to receive a particular flow.  This document\n\
    \   specifies a Join/Prune attribute that conveys the appropriate\n   receiver\
    \ RLOC address to the PIM control plane of the root ITR.\n   To support root-EID\
    \ mobility, receiver ETRs must also be tracked by\n   the LISP control plane of\
    \ the root ITR, regardless of the underlying\n   transport.  When the root-EID\
    \ moves to a new root ITR in a different\n   LISP site, the receiver ETRs do not\
    \ know the root-EID has moved and\n   therefore do not know the RLOC of the new\
    \ root ITR.  This is true for\n   both unicast and multicast transport modes.\
    \  The new root ITR does\n   not have any receiver ETR state.  Therefore, it is\
    \ the responsibility\n   of the old root ITR to inform the receiver ETRs that\
    \ the root-EID has\n   moved.  When the old root ITR detects that the root-EID\
    \ has moved, it\n   sends a LISP Solicit-Map-Request (SMR) message to each receiver\
    \ ETR.\n   The receiver ETRs do a mapping database lookup to retrieve the RLOC\n\
    \   of the new root ITR.  The old root ITR detects that the root-EID has\n   moved\
    \ when it receives a Map-Notify from the Map-Server.  The\n   transmission of\
    \ the Map-Notify is triggered when the new root ITR\n   registers the root-EID\
    \ [EID-MOBILITY].  When a receiver ETR\n   determines that the root ITR has changed,\
    \ it will send a LISP-\n   encapsulated PIM prune message to the old root xTR\
    \ and a LISP-\n   encapsulated PIM join message to the new root xTR.\n"
