  - "Abstract\n   There are scenarios in which an IP multicast tree traverses an MPLS\n
    \  domain.  In these scenarios, it can be desirable to convert the IP\n   multicast
    tree \"seamlessly\" into an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched\n   Path (MP-LSP) when
    it enters the MPLS domain, and then to convert it\n   back to an IP multicast
    tree when it exits the MPLS domain.  Previous\n   documents specify procedures
    that allow certain kinds of IP multicast\n   trees (either Source-Specific Multicast
    trees or Bidirectional\n   Multicast trees) to be attached to an MPLS Multipoint
    Label Switched\n   Path (MP-LSP).  However, the previous documents do not specify\n
    \  procedures for attaching IP Any-Source Multicast trees to MP-LSPs,\n   nor
    do they specify procedures for aggregating multiple IP multicast\n   trees onto
    a single MP-LSP.  This document specifies the procedures\n   to support these
    functions.  It does so by defining \"wildcard\"\n   encodings that make it possible
    to specify, when setting up an MP-\n   LSP, that a set of IP multicast trees,
    or a shared IP multicast tree,\n   should be attached to that MP-LSP.  Support
    for non-bidirectional IP\n   Any-Source Multicast trees is subject to certain
    applicability\n   restrictions that are discussed in this document.  This document\n
    \  updates RFCs 6826 and 7246.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC6826] and [RFC7246] specify procedures for mLDP (Multipoint
    LDP)\n   that allow an IP multicast tree (either a Source-Specific Multicast\n
    \  tree or a Bidirectional Multicast tree) to be attached \"seamlessly\"\n   to
    an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path (MP-LSP).  This can be\n   useful, for
    example, when there is multicast data that originates in\n   a domain that supports
    IP multicast, which then has to be forwarded\n   across a domain that supports
    MPLS multicast and then has to\n   forwarded across another domain that supports
    IP multicast.  By\n   attaching an IP multicast tree to an MP-LSP, data that is
    traveling\n   along the IP multicast tree can be moved seamlessly to the MP-LSP\n
    \  when it enters the MPLS multicast domain.  The data then travels\n   along
    the MP-LSP through the MPLS domain.  When the data reaches the\n   boundary of
    the MPLS domain, it can be moved seamlessly to an IP\n   multicast tree.  This
    ability to attach IP multicast trees to MPLS\n   MP-LSPs can be useful in either
    VPN context or global context.\n   In mLDP, every MP-LSP is identified by the
    combination of a \"root\n   node\" (or \"Ingress Label Switching Router (LSR)\")
    and an \"Opaque\n   Value\" that, in the context of the root node, uniquely identifies
    the\n   MP-LSP.  These are encoded into an mLDP \"Forwarding Equivalence Class\n
    \  (FEC) Element\".  To set up an MP-LSP, the Egress LSRs originate mLDP\n   control
    messages containing the FEC element.  A given FEC Element\n   value identifies
    a single MP-LSP and is passed upstream from the\n   Egress LSRs, through the intermediate
    LSRs, to the Ingress LSR.\n   In IP multicast, a multicast tree is identified
    by the combination of\n   an IP source address (\"S\") and an IP group address
    (\"G\"), usually\n   written as \"(S,G)\".  A tree carrying traffic of multiple
    sources is\n   identified by its group address, and the identifier is written
    as\n   \"(*,G)\".\n   When an MP-LSP is being set up, the procedures of [RFC6826]
    and\n   [RFC7246], known as \"mLDP in-band signaling\", allow the Egress LSRs\n
    \  of the MP-LSP to encode the identifier of an IP multicast tree in the\n   \"Opaque
    Value\" field of the mLDP FEC Element that identifies the MP-\n   LSP.  Only the
    Egress and Ingress LSRs are aware that the mLDP FEC\n   Elements contain encodings
    of the IP multicast tree identifier;\n   intermediate nodes along the MP-LSP do
    not take any account of the\n   internal structure of the FEC Element's Opaque
    Value, and the\n   internal structure of the Opaque Value does not affect the
    operation\n   of mLDP.  By using mLDP in-band signaling, the Egress LSRs of an
    MP-\n   LSP inform the Ingress LSR that they expect traffic of the identified\n
    \  IP multicast tree (and only that traffic) to be carried on the MP-\n   LSP.
    \ That is, mLDP in-band signaling not only sets up the MP-LSP, it\n   also binds
    a given IP multicast tree to the MP-LSP.\n   If multicast is being done in a VPN
    context [RFC7246], then the mLDP\n   FEC elements also contain a \"Route Distinguisher\"
    (RD) (see\n   [RFC7246]), as the IP multicast trees are identified not merely
    by\n   \"(S,G)\" but by \"(RD,S,G)\".  The procedures of this document are also\n
    \  applicable in this case.  Of course, when an Ingress LSR processes an\n   in-band
    signaling Opaque Value that contains an RD, it does so in the\n   context of the
    VPN associated with that RD.\n   If mLDP in-band signaling is not used, then some
    other protocol must\n   be used to bind an IP multicast tree to the MP-LSP; this
    requires\n   additional communication mechanisms between the Ingress LSR and the\n
    \  Egress LSRs of the MP-LSP.  The purpose of mLDP in-band signaling is\n   to
    eliminate the need for these other protocols.\n   When following the procedures
    of [RFC6826] and [RFC7246] for non-\n   bidirectional trees, the Opaque Value
    has an IP source address (S)\n   and an IP group address (G) encoded into it,
    thus enabling it to\n   identify a particular IP multicast (S,G) tree.  Only a
    single IP\n   source-specific multicast tree (i.e., a single \"(S,G)\") can be\n
    \  identified in a given FEC element.  As a result, a given MP-LSP can\n   carry
    data from only a single IP source-specific multicast tree\n   (i.e., a single
    \"(S,G) tree\").  However, there are scenarios in which\n   it would be desirable
    to aggregate a number of (S,G) trees on a\n   single MP-LSP.  Aggregation allows
    a given number of IP multicast\n   trees to use a smaller number of MP-LSPs, thus
    saving state in the\n   network.\n   In addition, [RFC6826] and [RFC7246] do not
    support the attachment of\n   an Any-Source Multicast (ASM) shared tree to an
    MP-LSP, except in the\n   case where the ASM shared tree is a bidirectional tree
    (i.e., a tree\n   set up by BIDIR-PIM [RFC5015]).  However, there are scenarios
    in\n   which it would be desirable to attach a non-bidirectional ASM shared\n
    \  tree to an MP-LSP.\n   This document specifies a way to encode an mLDP \"Opaque
    Value\" in\n   which either the \"S\" or the \"G\" or both are replaced by a \"wildcard\"\n
    \  (written as \"*\").  Procedures are described for using the wildcard\n   encoding
    to map non-bidirectional ASM shared trees to MP-LSPs and for\n   mapping multiple
    (S,G) trees (with a common value of S or a common\n   value of G) to a single
    MP-LSP.\n   Some example scenarios where wildcard encoding is useful are\n   o
    \ PIM shared tree forwarding with \"threshold infinity\";\n   o  IGMP/Multicast
    Listener Discovery (MLD) proxying; and\n   o  Selective Source mapping.\n   These
    scenarios are discussed in Section 4.  Note that this list of\n   scenarios is
    not meant to be exhaustive.\n   This document specifies only the mLDP procedures
    that are specific to\n   the use of wildcards.  mLDP in-band signaling procedures
    that are not\n   specific to the use of wildcards can be found in [RFC6826] and\n
    \  [RFC7246].  Unless otherwise specified in this document, those\n   procedures
    still apply when wildcards are used.\n"

    \     Root node of a MP-LSP.  When mLDP in-band signaling is used, the\n      Ingress
    LSR receives mLDP messages about a particular MP-LSP from\n      downstream and
    emits IP multicast control messages upstream.  The\n      set of IP multicast
    control messages that are emitted upstream\n      depends upon the contents of
    the LDP Opaque Value TLVs.  The\n      Ingress LSR also receives IP multicast

  title: 2.  Terminology and Definitions
- contents:
  - "3.  Wildcards in mLDP Opaque Value TLVs\n   [RFC6826] and [RFC7246] define the
    following Opaque Value TLVs:\n   Transit IPv4 Source TLV, Transit IPv6 Source
    TLV, Transit VPNv4\n   Source TLV, and Transit VPNv6 Source TLV.  The value field
    of each\n   such TLV is divided into a number of subfields, one of which contains\n
    \  an IP source address, and one of which contains an IP group address.\n   Per
    those documents, these fields must contain valid IP addresses.\n   This document
    extends the definition of those TLVs by allowing either\n   the IP source address
    field or the IP group address field (or both)\n   to specify a \"wildcard\" rather
    than a valid IP address.\n"

    - "3.1.  Encoding the Wildcards\n   A value of all zeroes in the IP source address
      subfield is used to\n   represent a wildcard source address.  A value of all
      zeroes in the IP\n   group address subfield is used to represent the wildcard
      group\n   address.  Note that the lengths of these subfields are as specified\n
      \  in the previous documents.\n"

    - "3.2.  Wildcard Semantics\n   If the IP source address subfield contains the
      wildcard, and the IP\n   group address subfield contains an IP multicast group
      address that is\n   NOT in the SSM address range (see Section 4.8 of [RFC4601]),
      then the\n   TLV identifies a PIM-SM shared tree.  Please see Section 3.4 for
      the\n   applicability restrictions that apply to this case.\n   If the IP source
      address subfield contains the wildcard, and the IP\n   group address subfield
      contains an IP multicast group address that is\n   in the SSM address range,

      and\n   the IP group address subfield contains the wildcard, the TLV\n   identifies
      the collection of PIM-SSM trees that have the source\n   address as their root.\n
      \  Procedures for the use of the wildcards are discussed in Sections 4,\n   5,
      and 6.  Please note that, as always, the structure of an Opaque\n   Value TLV

      VPNv6 Bidir TLV.\n   Procedures for the use of both a wildcard source and a
      wildcard group\n   in the same TLV are outside the scope of the current document.\n
      \  Note that the Bidir TLVs do not have a source address subfield, and\n   hence
      the notion of a wildcard source is not applicable to them.\n"

      the behavior described\n   in [RFC6826] and [RFC7246].\n   A correctly operating
      Egress LSR that supports [RFC6826] and/or\n   [RFC7246], but that does not support
      this document, will never\n   generate mLDP FEC Element Opaque values that contain

  - contents:
    - "4.1.  PIM Shared Tree Forwarding\n   PIM [RFC4601] has the concept of a \"shared
      tree\", identified as\n   (*,G).  This concept is only applicable when G is
      an IP multicast\n   group address that is not in the SSM address range (i.e.,
      is an ASM\n   group address).  Every ASM group is associated with a Rendezvous\n
      \  Point (RP), and the (*,G) tree is built towards the RP (i.e., its\n   root
      is the RP).  The RP for group G is responsible for forwarding\n   packets down
      the (*,G) tree.  The packets forwarded down the (*,G)\n   tree may be from any
      multicast source, as long as they have an IP\n   destination address of G.\n
      \  The RP learns about all the multicast sources for a given group and\n   then
      joins a source-specific tree for each such source.  That is,\n   when the RP
      for G learns that S has multicast data to send to G, the\n   RP joins the (S,G)
      tree.  When the RP receives multicast data from S\n   that is destined to G,
      the RP forwards the data down the (*,G) tree.\n   There are several different
      ways that the RP may learn about the\n   sources for a given group.  The RP
      may learn of sources via PIM\n   Register messages [RFC4601], via Multicast
      Source Discovery Protocol\n   (MSDP) [RFC3618], or by observing packets from
      a source that is\n   directly connected to the RP.\n   In PIM, a PIM router
      that has receivers for a particular ASM\n   multicast group G (known as a \"last
      hop\" router for G) will first\n   join the (*,G) tree.  As it receives multicast
      traffic on the (*,G)\n   tree, it learns (by examining the IP headers of the
      multicast data\n   packets) the sources that are transmitting to G.  Typically,
      when a\n   last hop router for group G learns that source S is transmitting
      to\n   G, the last hop router joins the (S,G) tree and \"prunes\" S off the\n
      \  (*,G) tree.  This allows each last hop router to receive the\n   multicast
      data along the shortest path from the source to the last\n   hop router.  (Full
      details of this behavior can be found in\n   [RFC4601].)\n   In some cases,
      however, a last hop router for group G may decide not\n   to join the source
      trees, but rather to keep receiving all the\n   traffic for G from the (*,G)
      tree.  In this case, we say that the\n   last hop router has \"threshold infinity\"
      for group G.  This is\n   optional behavior documented in [RFC4601].  \"Threshold
      infinity\" is\n   often used in deployments where the RP is between the multicast\n
      \  sources and the multicast receivers for group G, i.e., in deployments\n   where
      it is known that the shortest path from any source to any\n   receiver of the
      group goes through the RP.  In these deployments,\n   there is no advantage
      for a last hop router to join a source tree\n   since the data is already traveling
      along the shortest path.  The\n   only effect of executing the complicated procedures
      for joining a\n   source tree and pruning the source off the shared tree would
      be to\n   increase the amount of multicast routing state that has to be\n   maintained
      in the network.\n   To efficiently use mLDP in-band signaling in this scenario,
      it is\n   necessary for the Egress LSRs to construct an Opaque Value TLV that\n
      \  identifies a (*,G) tree.  This is done by using the wildcard in the\n   IP
      source address subfield and setting the IP group address subfield\n   to G.\n
      \  Note that these mLDP in-band signaling procedures do not support PIM-\n   ASM
      in scenarios where \"threshold infinity\" is not used.\n"

    - "4.2.  IGMP/MLD Proxying\n   There are scenarios where the multicast senders
      and receivers are\n   directly connected to an MPLS routing domain, and where
      it is desired\n   to use mLDP rather than PIM to set up \"trees\" through that
      domain.\n   In these scenarios, we can apply \"IGMP/MLD proxying\" and eliminate\n
      \  the use of PIM.  The senders and receivers consider the MPLS domain\n   to
      be single hop between each other.  [RFC4605] documents procedures\n   where
      a multicast routing protocol is not necessary to build a\n   \"simple tree\".
      \ Within the MPLS domain, mLDP will be used to build an\n   MP-LSP, but this
      is hidden from the senders and receivers.  The\n   procedures defined in [RFC4605]
      are applicable since the senders and\n   receivers are considered to be one
      hop away from each other.\n   For mLDP to build the necessary MP-LSP, it needs
      to know the root of\n   the tree.  Following the procedures as defined in [RFC4605],
      we\n   depend on manual configuration of the mLDP root for the ASM multicast\n
      \  group.  Since the MP-LSP for a given ASM multicast group will carry\n   traffic
      from all the sources for that group, the Opaque Value TLV\n   used to construct
      the MP-LSP will contain a wildcard in the IP source\n   address subfield.\n"

      are gathered into a\n   small number of sites.  Popular channels are often statically\n
      \  configured and forwarded over a core MPLS network to the Egress\n   routers.
      \ Since these channels are statically defined, they MAY also\n   be forwarded
      over a multipoint LSP with wildcard encoding.  The sort\n   of wildcard encoding
      that needs to be used (source and/or group)\n   depends on the source/group
      allocation policy of the IPTV provider.\n   Other options are to use MSDP [RFC3618]
      or BGP \"Auto-Discovery\"\n   procedures [RFC6513] for source discovery by the
      Ingress LSR.  Based\n   on the received wildcard, the Ingress LSR can select

  - "5.  Procedures for Wildcard Source Usage\n   The decision to use mLDP in-band
    signaling is made by the IP\n   multicast component of an Egress LSR, based on
    provisioned policy.\n   The decision to use (or not to use) a wildcard in the
    IP source\n   address subfield of an mLDP Opaque Value TLV is also made by the
    IP\n   multicast component, again based on provisioned policy.  Following\n   are
    some example policies that may be useful:\n   1.  Suppose that PIM is enabled,
    an Egress LSR needs to join a non-\n       bidirectional ASM group G, and the
    RP for G is reachable via a\n       BGP route.  The Egress LSR may choose the
    BGP Next Hop of the\n       route to the RP to be the Ingress LSR (root node)
    of the MP-LSP\n       corresponding to the (*,G) tree (see also Section 7).  The
    Egress\n       LSR may identify the (*,G) tree by using an mLDP Opaque Value TLV\n
    \      whose IP source address subfield contains a wildcard, and whose\n       IP
    group address subfield contains G.\n   2.  Suppose that PIM is not enabled for
    group G, and an IGMP/MLD\n       group membership report for G has been received
    by an Egress LSR.\n       The Egress LSR may determine the \"proxy device\" for
    G (see\n       Section 4.2).  It can then set up an MP-LSP for which the proxy\n
    \      device is the Ingress LSR.  The Egress LSR needs to signal the\n       Ingress
    LSR that the MP-LSP is to carry traffic belonging to\n       group G; it does
    this by using an Opaque Value TLV whose IP\n       source address subfield contains
    a wildcard, and whose IP group\n       address subfield contains G.\n   As the
    policies needed in any one deployment may be very different\n   than the policies
    needed in another, this document does not specify\n   any particular set of policies
    as being mandatory to implement.\n   When the Ingress LSR receives an mLDP Opaque
    Value TLV that has been\n   defined for in-band signaling, the information from
    the subfields of\n   that TLV is passed to the IP multicast component of the Ingress
    LSR.\n   If the IP source address subfield contains a wildcard, the IP\n   multicast
    component must determine how to process it.  The processing\n   MUST follow the
    rules below:\n   1.  If PIM is enabled and the group identified in the Opaque
    Value\n       TLV is a non-bidirectional ASM group, the Ingress LSR acts as if\n
    \      it had received a (*,G) IGMP/MLD report from a downstream node,\n       and
    the procedures defined in [RFC4601] are followed.\n   2.  If PIM is enabled and
    the identified group is a PIM-SSM group,\n       all multicast sources known for
    the group on the Ingress LSR are\n       to be forwarded down the MP-LSP.  In
    this scenario, it is assumed\n       that the Ingress LSR is already receiving
    all the necessary\n       traffic.  How the Ingress LSR receives this traffic
    is outside\n       the scope of this document.\n   3.  If PIM is not enabled for
    the identified group, the Ingress LSR\n       acts as if it had received a (*,G)
    IGMP/MLD report from a\n       downstream node, and the procedures as defined
    in [RFC4605] are\n       followed.  The Ingress LSR should forward the (*,G) packets
    to\n       the Egress LSR through the MP-LSP identified by the Opaque Value\n
    \      TLV.  (See also Section 4.2.)\n"

    based upon the IP\n   address of the source (\"S\") of the multicast stream.  To

    \  root node corresponding to a given (*,G) set of IP multicast streams.\n   The
