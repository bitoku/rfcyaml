July 1992 762, 758,755, 750, 739,	604, 503, 433, 349 ASSIGNED NUMBERS Status of this Memo
This	memo is	a status report	on the parameters (i.e., numbers and keywords) used in protocols in the Internet community.
Distribution of this memo	is unlimited.
This	Network	Working	Group Request for Comments documents the currently assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.
This RFC will be updated periodically, and in	any case current information can be obtained from the Internet	Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
If you are developing a protocol or application that will require the use of a link, socket, port, protocol, etc., please	contact
the IANA to receive a number assignment.

(310)	822 1511 Electronic mail:
Most	of the protocols mentioned here	are documented in the RFC series of notes.
Some of the items	listed are undocumented.
Further information on protocols can	be found in the	memo "IAB Official Protocol Standards" [62].
In the entries below, the name and mailbox of the responsible individual is indicated.
The bracketed entry, e.g.,	[nn,iii], at the right hand margin of	the page indicates a reference for the listed protocol, where the number ("nn") cites the document	and the	letters ("iii") cites the person.
Whenever possible, the letters are a NIC Ident as used in the	WhoIs (NICNAME)	service.
The convention in the documentation of Internet Protocols is	to express numbers in decimal and to picture data in "big endian" order [21].
That is, fields are described	left to	right, with the	most significant octet on	the left and the least significant octet on the right.
The order of	transmission of	the header and data described in this document is resolved	to the octet level.
Whenever a	diagram	shows a group of octets, the	order of transmission of those octets is the normal order	in which they are read in English.
For	example, in the following diagram the octets	are transmitted	in the order they are numbered.
3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
Whenever an octet represents	a numeric quantity the left most bit in the diagram is the high order or most significant bit.
That	is, the bit labeled 0 is the	most significant bit.
For example, the following diagram represents	the value 170 (decimal). 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7    1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
Significance	of Bits Similarly, whenever a multi octet field represents a	numeric	quantity the left most bit of	the whole field	is the most significant	bit.
When	a multi octet quantity is transmitted the most significant octet is transmitted first.
: There are five classes of IP	addresses: Class A through Class E [119].
Of these, Class E addresses are reserved for	experimental use.
A gateway which is not	participating in these experiments must ignore all datagrams	with a Class E destination IP address.
ICMP Destination Unreachable or ICMP Redirect messages must not result from	receiving such datagrams.
There are certain special cases for IP addresses [11].
<Subnet number>, <Host number> }
if we also use the notation " 1" to mean the	field contains all 1 bits.
Some common special cases are	as follows:
This host on this network.
Can only be used as a source address (see note later).
Can only be used as a source address.
{  1,  1} Limited broadcast.
Can only be used as a destination address, and a datagram with this address must never be forwarded outside the (sub )net of the source.
} Directed broadcast to specified network.
Can only be used as a destination address.
{<Network number>, <Subnet number>,  1
} Directed broadcast to specified subnet.
Can only be used as a destination address.
} Directed broadcast to all subnets of specified subnetted network.
Can only be used as a destination	address.
{127, <any>} Internal host loopback address.
Should never appear outside a host.

Known Ports are controlled and	assigned by the	IANA and on most systems	can only be used by system (or root) processes or by programs executed by privileged users.
Ports are used in the TCP [45,106] to name the ends of logical connections which carry	long term conversations.
For the purpose of providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is defined.
This list specifies the port used by the server process as its contact	port.
The contact port	is sometimes called the	"well known port".
To the extent possible,	these same port	assignments are	used with the UDP [46,104].
The assigned ports use a small portion of the possible port numbers.
For many years the assigned ports were in the range 0 255.
Recently, the range for assigned ports managed by
the IANA has been expanded to the range 0 1023.

The Registered Ports are not controlled	by the IANA and	on most	systems can be used by ordinary	user processes or programs executed by ordinary users.
Ports are used in the TCP [45,106] to name the ends of logical connections which carry	long term conversations.
For the purpose of providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is defined.
This list specifies the port used by the server process as its contact	port.
While the IANA can not control uses of these ports it does register or list uses of these ports as a convienence to the community.
To the extent possible,	these same port	assignments are	used with the UDP [46,104].
The Registered Ports are in the	range 1024 65535.

/udp INTERNET	MULTICAST ADDRESSES Host	Extensions for IP Multicasting (RFC 1112)
[43] specifies the extensions required of a host implementation	of the Internet	Protocol (IP)	to support multicasting.
Current addresses are	listed below.
224.0.0.1	 All Systems on	this Subnet			[43,JBP]
224.0.4.0 224.0.4.255 RFE	Individual Conferences
These addresses are listed in the	Domain Name Service under MCAST.NET	and 224.IN ADDR.ARPA.
Note that	when used on an	Ethernet or IEEE 802 network, the 23 low order	bits of
the IP Multicast address are placed in the low  order 23 bits of the Ethernet or IEEE 802	net multicast address 1.0.94.0.0.0.
See the next section on "IANA ETHERNET ADDRESS BLOCK".
The IANA owns an Ethernet address block which may be	used for multicast address asignments	or other special purposes.
The address block in	IEEE binary is (which is in bit	transmission order):
0000 0000 0000 0111	1010
In the normal Internet dotted decimal notation this is 0.0.94 since the bytes are transmitted higher order first	and bits within	bytes are transmitted lower order first (see "Data	Notation" in the Introduction).
CSMA/CD	and Token Bus bit transmission order:
Token Ring bit transmission order: 00 00
7A Appearance on the wire (bits	transmitted from left to right): 0
xxx0 xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
Assigned by IANA for other uses Appearance in memory	(bits transmitted right to left	within octets, octets transmitted left to right):
Assigned by IANA for other uses
The latter representation corresponds to the	Internet standard bit  order, and is the format that most programmers have to deal with.
Using this representation, the range	of Internet Multicast addresses is: 01 00 5E 00 00
5E 7F FF FF  in hex, or 1.0.94.0.0.0	to  1.0.94.127.255.255	in dotted decimal IP	TOS PARAMETERS
This	documents the default Type of Service values that are currently recommended for the most important Internet protocols.
There are four assigned TOS values: low delay, high throughput, high reliability,	and low	cost; in each case, the	TOS value is used to indicate "better".
Only one	TOS value or property can be requested in any one IP datagram.
Generally, protocols	which are involved in direct interaction with a human should	select low delay, while	data transfers which may involve large blocks	of data	are need high throughput.
Finally, high reliability is most important for datagram based Internet management functions.
Application protocols not included in these tables should be	able to make	appropriate choice of low delay	(8 decimal, 1000 binary) or high throughput (
The following are recommended values	for TOS:
Type of Service	Value   Protocol
Domain Name Service UDP Query
(4) Responses	 <same as request>
(1) Includes all interactive user	protocols (e.g., rlogin).
(2) Includes all bulk data transfer protocols (e.g., rcp).
If the implementation	does not support changing the TOS during the lifetime of the connection, then the recommended TOS on opening the connection is
Although ICMP	request	messages are normally sent with	the default TOS, there are sometimes good reasons why	they would be sent with	some other TOS value.
An ICMP response	always uses the same TOS value as	was used in the	corresponding ICMP request message.
An application may (at the request of the user) substitute 0001 (minimize monetary cost) for	any of the above values.
The current recommended default time	to live	(TTL) for the Internet Protocol (IP) [45,105] is 64.
The Internet	Domain Naming System (DOMAIN) includes several parameters.
These are documented in	RFC 1034, [81] and RFC 1035 [82].
The CLASS parameter is listed	here.
The per CLASS parameters are defined in separate RFCs	as indicated.
a mail destination (Obsolete use MX)

RFC 951 [36] describes an IP/UDP bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) which allows a diskless client machine to discover its	own IP address,	the address of a server	host, and the name	of a file to be	loaded into memory and executed.
The BOOTP Vendor Information Extensions RFC 1084
[117]	describes an addition to the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP).
Vendor Extensions are listed	below:

For the management of hosts and gateways on the Internet a data structure for the information has been defined.
This data structure should be used with any of several possible management protocols, such as the "Simple Network Management Protocol"
(SNMP) RFC 1157 [15], or the "Common Management Information Protocol over TCP" (CMOT)	[142].
The data structure is the "Structure	and Indentification of Management Information for TCP/IP based	Internets" (SMI) RFC 1155 [120], and the "Management Information Base	for Network Management of TCP/IP based Internets" (MIB II) [121].
The SMI includes the	provision for panrameters or codes to indicate experimental	or private data	structures.
These parameter assignments are listed here.
The older "Simple Gateway Monitoring	Protocol" (SGMP)
also	defined	a data structure.
The parameter assignments used with SGMP	are included here for hist orical completeness.
The network management object identifiers are under the iso (1), org (3),	dod (6), internet (1), or 1.3.6.1, branch of the name space.

The MILNET facility for "logical addressing"	is described in	RFC 878 [57]	and RFC 1005
A portion of the possible logical addresses are reserved	for standard uses.
There are 49,152 possible logical host addresses.
Of these,	256 are reserved for	assignment to well known functions.
Assignments for well known functions	are made by the	IANA.
Assignments for other logical host	addresses are made by the NIC.
The word "link" here	refers to a field in the original MILNET Host/IMP interface leader.
The link	was originally defined as an 8  bit field.
Later specifications defined this field as the "message  id" with a length of	12 bits.
The name link	now refers to the high order 8 bits	of this	12 bit message
The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN Report 1822 [2].
The low order 4 bits	of the message
id field	are called the sub link.
Unless explicitly specified otherwise for a particular protocol, there is no sender to receiver significance to the sub link.
The sender may use the sub link in any way he chooses (it is returned in the RFNM by the destination IMP), the receiver should ignore	the sub link.
[JGH] 155	Internet Protocol [regular]
All MILNET hosts are	assigned addresses by the Defense Data Network (DDN).
The address of a MILNET host	may be obtained	from the Network Information Center (NIC), represented as an ASCII text string in what is called "host table format".
This	section	describes the process by which MILNET	X.25 addresses may be derived from addresses in	the NIC host	table format.
A NIC host table address consists of
the ASCII text string representations of four decimal numbers separated by	periods, corresponding to the	four octeted of	a thirty two bit Internet address.
The four decimal numbers are referred to in this section as "n",	"h' "l", and "i".
Thus, a host	table address may be represented as: "n.h.l.i".
Each	of these four numbers will have	either one, two, or three decimal digits and will never have a value greater than 255.
For example,	in the host table, address: "10.2.0.124", n 10,	h 2, l 0,	and i 124.
To convert a host table address to a MILNET	X.25 address: 1.
If h < 64, the host table address corresponds	to the X.25 physical address:
where: ZZZZ	  0000	  as required F   0	  because the address is a physical address; III		  is a three decimal digit respresentation of "i",
right adjusted and padded with leading zeros	if required; HH		  is a two decimal digit representation	of "h",
In the example given above, the host table address 10.2.0.124 corresponds to the X.25 physical address 000001240200.
h > 64 or h  	64, the	host table address corresponds to the X.25	logical	address
(Note that the decimal representation of "r" will	always require five digits);
Thus, the	host table address 10.83.0.207 corresponds to the X.25 logical address 000012145500.
In both cases, the "n" and "l" fields of the	host table address are not used.
Some	of the networks	of all classes are
These systems may use a Link Service Access Point (LSAP) field in much the same	way the	MILNET uses the	"link" field.
Further,	there is an extension of
the LSAP header	called the Sub Network Access Protocol (SNAP).
The IEEE likes to describe numbers in binary	in bit transmission order, which	is the opposite	of the big endian order	used throughout the Internet	protocol documentation.
These numbers (and others) are assigned by the IEEE Standards Office.
The address is: IEEE	Standards Office, 345 East 47th	Street,
At an ad hoc	special	session	on "IEEE 802 Networks and ARP",	held during the TCP Vendors Workshop (August 1986), an approach to a consistent way to send DoD IP datagrams and other IP	related protocols (such as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)) on	802 networks was	developed, using the SNAP extension (see RFC 1042 [90]).
Many	of the networks	of all classes are Ethernets (10Mb) or Experimental	Ethernets (3Mb).
These	systems	use a message "type" field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field.
If you need an Ethernet type, contact the Xerox Corporation,	Xerox Systems Institute, 475 Oakmead Parkway, Sunnyvale, CA 94086,

The standard	for transmission of IP datagrams over Ethernets	and
Experimental	Ethernets is specified in RFC 894 [61] and RFC 895 [91] respectively.
Ethernet 48 bit address blocks are assigned by the IEEE.
IEEE	Standards Office, 345 East 47th	Street,
ETHERNET VENDOR ADDRESS COMPONENTS Ethernet hardware addresses are 48 bits, expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits (0 9,	plus A F, capitalized).
These 12 hex digits consist of the first/left 6 digits (which should match the vendor of the Ethernet interface within the station) and the last/right 6 digits which specify the interface serial number for that interface	vendor.
Ethernet addresses might be written unhyphenated (e.g., 123456789ABC), or with one hyphen (e.g., 123456 789ABC), but	should be written hyphenated by octets (e.g., 12 34 56 78 9A BC).
These addresses are physical	station	addresses, not multicast nor broadcast, so the second hex	digit (reading from the	left) will be even, not odd.
At present, it is not clear how the IEEE assigns Ethernet block addresses.
Whether in blocks of 2  24 or 2  25, and	whether multicasts are assigned with	that block or separately.
A portion of the vendor block address is reportedly assigned serially, with the other portion intentionally assigned	randomly.
If there is a global algorithm for which addresses are designated	to be physical (in a chipset) versus logical (assigned in	software), or globally assigned versus locally assigned addresses, some of the known	addresses do not follow the scheme (e.g., AA0003; 02xxxx).

EtherTalk XNS	PROTOCOL TYPES Assigned well known socket numbers Routing Information
ASSIGNMENTS Below are two tables	describing the arrangement of protocol fields or type	field assignments so that one could send NS Datagrams on the MILNET or Internet Datagrams	on 10Mb	Ethernet, and also protocol and type	fields so one could encapsulate	each kind of Datagram in the other.
Below is the	current	list of	PRONET 80 Type Numbers.
a protocol that is on this list does not necessarily mean that	there is any implementation of it on ProNET.
Of these, protocols 1, 14, and 20 are the only ones that have ever been	seen in	ARP packets.
For reference, the header is	(one byte/line): destination hardware	address source hardware address data	link header version (2)
data	link header protocol number data
link header reserved (0) data	link header reserved (
Some	protocols have been known to tuck stuff	in the reserved	fields.
Those who need a protocol number on ProNET 10/80 should contact John Shriver (jas@proteon.com).

Cornell Boot Server Location Protocol
POINT TO POINT PROTOCOL FIELD
The Point to Point Protocol (PPP) Data Link Layer [146,147,175] contains a 16 bit Protocol field to identify	the the	encapsulated protocol.
The Protocol field is consistent with the	ISO 3309
(HDLC) extension mechanism for Address fields.
All	Protocols MUST be assigned such that the least	significant bit	of the most significant octet equals	"0", and the least significant bit of the least significant octet equals "1".
Assigned PPP DLL Protocol Numbers Value (in hex)
Xerox NS IDP	Control	Protocol 8027
DECnet Phase	IV Control Protocol 8029
It is recommended that values in the	"02 " to "1e " and " 01" to " 1f" ranges not be	assigned, as they are compression inefficient.
Protocol field values in the	"4 " to "7 " range are used	for protocols with low volume traffic which have	no associated NCP.
Protocol field values in the	"c " to "e " range identify datagrams as	Control	Protocols (such	as LCP).
PPP LCP	AND IPCP CODES
The Point to Point Protocol (PPP) Link Control Protocol (LCP) [146] and Internet	Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) [147] contain an 8 bit Code	field which identifies the type	of packet.
These Codes	are assigned as follows:
LCP Only PPP LCP	CONFIGURATION OPTION TYPES The Point to Point Protocol
(PPP) Link Control Protocol (LCP) specifies a number of Configuration Options [146] which are distinguished by an 8 bit Type field.
These	Types are assigned as follows:
