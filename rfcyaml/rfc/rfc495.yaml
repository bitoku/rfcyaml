  - "                     TELNET Protocol Specification\nFollowing much discussion\
    \ of TELNET via the RFC series, an open meeting\nwas held at UCLA on 5 March to\
    \ formulate a new specification for the\nTELNET Protocol.  Two attached documents\
    \ (TELNET Protocol Specification,\nresults of that meeting, which was attended\
    \ by: Alex McKenzie, BBN-NET,\nco-chairman; Jon Postel, UCLA-NMC, co-chairman;\
    \ Bob Braden, UCLA-CCN;\nVint Cerf, Stanford University; Bernie Cosell, BBN-NET;\
    \ Dave Crocker,\nUCLA-NMC; Steve Crocker, ARPA; John Davidson, Univ. of Hawaii;\
    \ Gary\nGrossman, Univ. of Illinois; Bob Merryman, UCSD; Lou Nelson, UCLA-NMC;\n\
    Mike Padlipsky, MIT-MULTICS: Milt Reese, FNW; Bob Thomas, BBN-TENEX;\nSteve Wolfe,\
    \ UCLA-CCN.\nThe two attached specifications referenced above have been reviewed\
    \ by\nthe meeting attendees, and should be viewed as the \"official\" TELNET\n\
    Protocol (subject to the implementation schedule given below).\nNevertheless,\
    \ these documents are still subject to minor revisions and\nany pertinent comments\
    \ should be addressed to me at the NIC as AAM, or\nby mail at:\n             \
    \              Alex McKenzie\n                           Bolt Beranek and Newman\
    \ Inc.\n                           50 Moulton Street\n                       \
    \    Cambridge, Ma. 02138\n   There are two key dates for a phasing in of the\
    \ new protocol:  the\n   date when sites should feel free to send the \"new\"\
    \ form of TELNET\n   commands and special codes without expecting to receive \"\
    error\"\n   responses, and the date when sites may remove the code which\n   processes\
    \ the \"old\" form of TELNET commands.  Between these two\n   dates, sites may\
    \ gradually implement and test the \"interpreter\" for\n   the new commands. \
    \ It was the sense of the meeting that appropriate\n   lead times to these two\
    \ dates were about 60 and 260 days.\n   Accordingly, these two dates are hereby\
    \ established as 1 July 1973\n   and 1 January 1974.\n   I have also attached\
    \ specifications for TELNET options which allow\n   negotiation of:\n        \
    \    o binary transmission\n            o echoing\n            o reconnection\n\
    \            o suppression of \"Go Ahead\"\n            o approximate message\
    \ size\n            o use of a \"timing mark\"\n            o discussion of status\n\
    \            o extension of option code set\n   These specifications have been\
    \ prepared by Dave Walden (BBN-NET) with\n   the help of Bernie Cosell, Ray Tomlinson\
    \ (BBN-TENEX) and Bob Thomas;\n   by Jerry Burchfiel (BBN-TENEX); and by David\
    \ Crocker (ULCA-NMC).  It\n   appears that these options cover most of the capabilities\
    \ of the\n   current version of TELNET, with the exception of \"Hide Your Input.\"\
    \n   Dave Walden has also promised to specify the following options in the\n \
    \  near future:\n            o NVT printer line width negotiation\n          \
    \  o NVT printer page size negotiation\n            o negotiation of the mapping\
    \ between the line terminator\n              character available on a physical\
    \ terminal (e.g., LF,\n              CR, NL) and the NVT characters to be transmitted\n\
    \              (e.g., CR NUL, LF, CR LF).\n   Dave has also announced his intent\
    \ to seek collaboration with\n   Gary Grossman, Bob Braden, and perhaps others\
    \ in defining an\n   EBCDIC option.  The announcement of intent to specify these\n\
    \   options should, of course, be seen as useful information rather\n   than as\
    \ the granting of an \"exclusive right\" to Dave, or any\n   other author.\n \
    \  I gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Bernie Cosell\n   in the preparation\
    \ of the protocol specification.\n   AAM/jm\n   Attachments\n       [ This RFC\
