    \             Format of ARPA Network Messages\n              Ken Pogran, MIT-LCS/CSR\
    \    (Pogran at MIT-Multics)\n              John Vittal, BBN            (Vittal\
    \ at BBN-TENEXA)\n              Dave Crocker, RAND-ISD     (DCrocker at Rand-Unix)\n\
    \                                  PREFACE\n          ARPA's  Committee  on  Computer-Aided\
    \  Human   Communication\n     (CAHCOM) wishes to promulgate an official standard\
    \ for the format\n     of ARPA Network mail headers which will adequately meet\
    \ the needs\n     of  the  various message service subsystems on the Network today.\n\
    \     The authors  of  this  RFC  constitute  the  CAHCOM  subcommittee\n    \
    \ charged  with  the  task  of  developing  this new standard; this\n     document\
    \ presents our  current  thoughts  on  the  matter  and  a\n     specific proposal.\n\
    \          This document is organized as follows: First, we  present  a\n    \
    \ history,  of the development of what has become known as the ARPA\n     Network\
    \ \"mail\" or \"message\" service, and the issues which we feel\n     are  most\
    \  pressing  --  problems for which solutions are lacking\n     today, inhibiting\
    \ the further development of message  subsystems.\n     We  then  present  the\
    \  specification  for  the  new ARPA Network\n     Message Header  standard. \
    \  This  is  followed  by  a  References\n     section.\n          Essentially,\
    \ we propose a revision to Request  for  Comments\n     (RFC)  561,  \"Standardizing\
    \  Network  Mail Headers\", and RFC 680,\n     \"Message  Transmission  Protocol\"\
    .   This  revision  removes  and\n     compacts  portions  of  the  previous \
    \ syntax  and  adds  several\n     features to network address  specification.\
    \   In  particular,  we\n     focus  on  people  and  not  mailboxes  as  recipients\
    \  and allow\n     reference to stored address lists.   We  expect  this  syntax\
    \  to\n     provide  sufficient  capabilities  to  meet most users' immediate\n\
    \     needs and, therefore, give developers enough  breathing  room  to\n    \
    \ produce  a new mail transmission protocol \"properly\".  We believe\n     that\
    \ there is enough of a consensus in the Network  community  in\n     favor  of\
    \ such a standard syntax to make possible its adoption at\n     this time.\n \
    \         We would like to make clear  the  status  of  this  proposed\n     standard:\
    \  The CAHCOM Steering Committee has replaced the Message\n     Service Committee\
    \ as the ARPANET  standards-setting  organization\n     in  the  area  of  message\
    \  services.   It  is  expected that the\n     proposal of this CAHCOM subcommittee,\
    \ when  in  its  final  form,\n     will  be  adopted  as  an  ARPANET  standard\
    \  by  CAHCOM.  In the\n     interests of making this standard the best possible\
    \ one,  we  are\n     distributing  this  proposal as an RFC.\n          Please\
    \ send any  comments  and  criticisms  to  any  of  the\n     authors  of  this\
    \  RFC  by  15 June 1977.  It is planned that the\n     standard will be officially\
    \ adopted by  1  September  1977,  with\n                             CONTENTS\n\

    \ STANDARDS\n     A.  BACKGROUND AND HISTORY\n          Today's ARPA Network \"\
    mail\" or \"message\" service  uses,  for\n     its delivery mechanism, two special\
    \ commands of the File Transfer\n     Protocol.  Viewed from within the structure\
    \ of  FTP,  the  entire\n     message,  both header and text, is data for the\
    \ FTP MAIL and MLFL\n     commands.  This facility was added to the File Transfer\
    \  Protocol\n     as  an  afterthought;  it was an interim solution to be used\
    \ only\n     until  a  separate  mail  transmission  protocol  was  specified.\n\
    \     Several  versions of such a protocol have been proposed, but none\n    \
    \ has yet received general acceptance.   Meanwhile,  attempts  have\n     been\
    \ made to improve upon the original interim facility.\n          As  message \
    \ service  subsystems  on  various  host  systems\n     (especially  TENEX)  developed\
    \  to  the  point  where rudimentary\n     parsing of incoming messages was being\
    \ done, it became clear that\n     it  would  be  desirable to standardize the\
    \ format and content of\n     the headers of messages transmitted between hosts\
    \ using these FTP\n     commands.   To this end, an ad hoc committee wrote RFC\
    \ 561, which\n     suggested a standard message header format.   The  committee\
    \  was\n     unofficial,  so  it could not legislate a standard, it could only\n\
    \     recommend.  However, the standard it suggested adequately met  an\n    \
    \ urgent need, and was generally adopted.\n          Several  salient  points\
    \ should be noted:\n          1. RFC 561 defined the concept  of  a  message \
    \ header,  and\n             specified  the  syntax which delimited it from the\
    \ actual\n             text of a message;\n          2. It proposed a standard\
    \ format for the  most  obvious  and\n             most  urgently-needed header\
    \ items: \"From:\", \"Date:\", and\n             \"Subject:\";\n          3. It\
    \ proposed that a general standard syntax  be  used  for\n             all other\
    \ header items;\n          4. RFC 561 is still, today, an unofficial standard,\
    \  adhered\n             to by most because of its utility;\n          5. Its\
    \ syntax was designed to allow humans to read the  text\n             easily,\
    \  without  the  aid  of special message processing\n          As message services\
    \ grew in  sophistication,  the  need  for\n     specific header items in RFC\
    \ 561's \"miscellaneous\" category grew:\n     \"To:\" and \"cc:\", especially,\
    \ were  generated  and  recognized  by\n     several  different  message  services.\
    \   However,  there  was  no\n     specific standard for the syntax of the contents\
    \ of these  items.\n     The  message  service  subsystems on TENEX developed\
    \ a particular\n     format for these items; since more messages originated  from\
    \  the\n     TENEX  hosts  on  the  Network  than  from any other type of host\n\
    \     system, the TENEX format for these fields soon became a de  facto\n    \
    \ standard.   Message  service  subsystems  on TENEX began to parse\n     these\
    \ fields, expecting them to be in the TENEX-generated format.\n     Message service\
    \ subsystems on other hosts -- Multics, for example\n     -- began to dabble with\
    \ other formats  for  these  fields,  since\n     there  was  no standard for\
    \ them, only to receive complaints from\n     users of  TENEX  message  service\
    \  subsystems  that  their  \"non-\n     standard\"  message  headers  could not\
    \ be parsed according to the\n     (de facto) \"standard\" syntax.\n         \
    \ Recognizing that the time had come to  make  an  attempt  to\n     standardize\
    \  the  additional header fields that had come into use\n     since RFC 561 was\
    \ published,  ARPA's  Message  Service  Committee\n     chartered  a  small group\
    \ in 1975 to develop a revised version of\n     RFC 561 which would define the\
    \ syntax of these additional message\n     header  fields.   Several things should\
    \ be noted about this small\n     group of  people:  first,  they  were  TENEX-oriented;\
    \  when  the\n     functionality  of  the  message  header  items  they  desired\
    \ was\n     matched by  the  functionality  of  an  already-existing  message\n\
    \     header  item  of  the  TENEX message subsystems, they adopted the\n    \
    \ syntax used by the TENEX message subsystems.  Second, they  based\n     additional\
    \  header  items  not  already  found  on  TENEX message\n     subsystems on the\
    \ deliberations of the Message Service Committee.\n     Third,  they were not\
    \ familiar with the procedure for publication\n     of a document as a Network\
    \ RFC.\n          The document which this group produced,  labelled  RFC  680,\n\
    \     \"Message    Transmission   Protocol\",   received   only   limited\n  \
    \   distribution.  Matters were further confused  because  its  title\n     was\
    \  misleading, since it was not a protocol for the transmission\n     of messages\
    \ between ARPA Network hosts, but rather a standard for\n     the format of messages\
    \ transmitted via the standard File Transfer\n     Protocol.    Some,   including\
    \  the  Message  Service  Committee,\n     believed that RFC 680 became a Network\
    \ Standard.   This  was  not\n     strictly true, because it never received proper\
    \ distribution, and\n     it had never been \"officially blessed\" by anyone,\
    \ to turn it from\n     a  request  for  comments  into an accepted official ARPA\
    \ Network\n     standard document.  Reflecting this confusion over the status\
    \  of\n     the  document  are  the  facts  that  the document DOES currently\n\
    \     reside in the \"official\"  ARPANET  Protocol  Handbook,  and  most\n  \
    \   users and message system implementors remain unaware that this is\n      \
    \    For all its shortcomings, RFC 680  has  performed  a  needed\n     service,\
    \  just  as  did RFC 561 before it.  It defined additional\n     message header\
    \ items at a time  when  this  needed  to  be  done.\n     Unfortunately,  since\
    \  the  group  had not sought ideas and input\n     from others, the specification\
    \ did not adequately  respond  to  a\n     sufficient  set  of  community needs.\
    \  In addition, the manner in\n     which the document was promulgated -- or not\
    \ promulgated --  left\n     a great deal to be desired.  Implementators of message-processing\n\
    \     subsystems who had not received RFC 680 proceeded to go their own\n    \
    \ ways, feeling justified in doing so, while those who accepted RFC\n     680\
    \ as a standard felt justified in complaining to --  and  about\n     --  those\
    \  whom  they  considered  to be maverick implementors of\n     idiosyncratic\
    \ message service subsystems.\n          Perhaps because of the ad-hoc nature\
    \  of  the  interim  mail\n     facility,  users  have not, until recently, attempted\
    \ to push the\n     system to the limits of their imagination.   Presently,  however,\n\
    \     several different sites are using the \"interim\" mail facility for\n  \
    \   more than it was designed and in ways which are incompatible both\n     with\
    \  each  other  and  with the original intent of the facility.\n     Mail subsystem\
    \  implementors  are  increasingly  being  asked  to\n     provide for the handling\
    \ of mail from idiosyncratic hosts.  Also,\n     it has become clear that there\
    \ are a few very  specific features,\n     too useful to ignore, which cannot\
    \ reasonably be specified within\n     the syntax of RFC 680.\n     B.  ISSUES\
    \ AND CONCLUSIONS\n          At first glance, it would seem that a resolution\
    \ of  today's\n     somewhat  chaotic situation could best be obtained by immediately\n\
    \     junking the existing \"interim\" mail facility, and adopting a true\n  \
    \   mail  transmission protocol.  We strongly believe that this would\n     be\
    \ ill-advised at this time, for we feel that there is no general\n     understanding\
    \  within  the  Network  community  today  of  how to\n     specify and implement\
    \  a  full  and  adequate  mail  transmission\n     protocol.   However,  we \
    \ are convinced that there is, finally, a\n     strong commitment within the Network\
    \  community  to  attack  this\n     problem  (which  there  was  not  at  the\
    \ time the \"interim\" mail\n     transmission facility was specified and developed).\n\
    \          The frontal attacks on the mail protocol  problem  have,  so\n    \
    \ far, resulted in at least two suggestions for a mail transmission\n     protocol.\
    \  Why should not  one  of  these  protocols  be  adopted\n     immediately? We\
    \ feel that, in general, there has been a  tendency\n     for  experimental  Network\
    \  software to be prematurely treated as\n     though  it  were  adequately  designed\
    \  and  fully   operational.\n     Typically, the system or protocol proposed\
    \ is so much better than\n     chance to properly develop and mature.   We  are\
    \  very  concerned\n     that this phenomenon not afflict the Network mail system\
    \ any more\n     than it already has.\n          While it is true that there are\
    \ several sites  in  the  ARPA\n     Community  which  have  mail  systems  that\
    \ understand the syntax\n     specified in RFC's 561 and 680, in addition to some\
    \ of the  \"non-\n     standard\"  syntax  provided  by  the  mail generating\
    \ programs at\n     several other sites, most mail systems do not parse much \
    \ of  the\n     contents  of  received  messages.   A consideration of the syntax\n\
    \     specified here is that messages which are sent to  people  should\n    \
    \ be  easily  read  by  people.   Parsers  which  can turn an ugly,\n     syntactically\
    \ expedient form into something which is easy to read\n     are  the  exception,\
    \  rather  than  the  rule, in today's message\n     systems.  Also, the modifications\
    \ to the existing  \"non-standard\"\n     syntax  should  be  kept  to a minimum,\
    \ enhancing the probability\n     that the requirement of small perturbations\
    \ to existing  software\n     will be accepted.\n          With this syntax, we\
    \ introduce mechanisms so that:\n          1. Users of mail systems can have multiple\
    \ mailboxes, either\n             on  one  machine  or  multiple machines, all\
    \ of which are\n             treated identically; the default mailbox for  a \
    \ user  is\n             not  necessarily  associated  (directly)  with  his login\n\
    \             name.\n          2. Mail for a person can be sent to  other  than\
    \  a  single,\n             default mailbox.\n          3. Named   groups  may\
    \  consist  of  both  individuals   and\n             (possibly)  other  named\
    \  groups  (i.e.,  nesting  within\n             groups is permitted).\n     \
    \     4. Address lists may contain references  to  other,  stored,\n         \
    \    lists.  The complete path with which one can retrieve the\n             stored\
    \ list may be specified in  order  to  allow  either\n             manual or automatic\
    \ retrieval of the stored list.\n          5. Address lists may contain references\
    \ to  addresses  which\n             are  not  accessible through the standard\
    \ ARPANET message\n             system.  For example, U.S.  Postal system  addresses\
    \  can\n             be specified.  Such addresses are, of course, expected to\n\
    \             be ignored by the  ARPANET  system,  although  individual\n    \
    \         sites  may  provide  services  for  using the information\n        \
    \     (e.g., automatically sending a copy of the  message to  a\n            \
    \ line printer, in preparation for transmission through the\n             Postal\
    \ system).\n          6. Parenthetical remarks, or comments, can be  included\
    \  and\n          7. Received messages are capable of  being  read  by  humans\n\
    \             without  a  program having to parse the message (or parts\n    \
    \         of it) before presenting the message to the user; however\n        \
    \     there  is  sufficient  formal  syntax to enable a parsing\n            \
    \ program to modify the appearance and content of  material\n             presented\
    \  to  users.   Although message-display software\n             may   exercise\
    \   considerable   control   over    message\n             appearance, the degree\
    \ to which a message's actual format\n             is  PLEASANT  for  humans \
    \ to  read   is   entirely   the\n             responsibility of the message creation\
    \ program.\n     No mechanism for authentication is provided,  since  the  Network\n\
    \     provides  no  mechanisms for enforcing mail security.  The syntax\n    \
    \ does provide for one aspect of \"correctness\":  a  distinction  is\n     made\
    \  between  an  address which is claimed to be a valid network\n     address and\
    \ one which is  simply  free  text,  included  for  the\n     convenience of the\
    \ human participants.\n     C. MESSAGE PARTS\n          Some  confusion  has \
    \ existed  over  the  roles  played   by\n     different message parts.  Einar\
    \ Stefferud has suggested using the\n     perspective of envelope, letter head,\
    \ and  letter  content.   The\n     presence of structured portions in messages\
    \ additionally requires\n     reference to \"headers\".\n          In  computer-based\
    \  message  systems,  human  users  do  not\n     generally  encounter  \"envelopes\"\
    ,  which  are  often constructed\n     automatically, to be  used  by  the  participating\
    \  system(s)  to\n     deliver  the  message.  For example on TENEX, the envelope\
    \ is the\n     name of the file containing a message awaiting transmission.  For\n\
    \     FTP  servers,  it is the data portion of the MAIL or MLFL command\n    \
    \ line.  Some systems attach  \"envelope-like\"  information  to  the\n     message\
    \ header, such as time-stamp and originating host name.\n          In paper-based\
    \ communications,  headers  occur  both  before\n     (e.g., \"To:\" and \"From:\"\
    \ and after (e.g., \"cc:\" and \"enclosure:\")\n     the body of the message.\
    \  Within this standard, all headers occur\n     before  the  body  of the message,\
    \ although local message display\n     programs may choose to alter that ordering.\n\
    \          Wayne Hathaway has pointed out that ARPANET  message  format\n    \
    \ does not support specification of letterheads, since these are  a\n     type\
    \   of   organizational   public   relations   symbol.    Some\n     idiosyncrasies\
    \ are supported, however, by way of choosing special\n     field names.\n    \
    \ message, variously participating in each of the  three  functions\n     suggested\
    \ by Stefferud.\n     D. ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD\n         During the early phases\
    \ of specifying this standard, a  great\n     deal  of  concern  was  expressed\
    \  over the problems which may be\n     experienced during the transition from\
    \ the  current  standard  to\n     this  new  one.   We  feel  that  the true\
    \ problem is the lack of\n     realization that THERE IS NO CURRENT OFFICIAL \
    \ STANDARD.   Enough\n     systems  have  enough  overlapping behaviors to allow\
    \ the current\n     mail environment to function, but this in no  way  constitutes\
    \  a\n     standard.\n          In fact, we  strongly  believe  that  the  new\
    \  requirements\n     imposed by the proposed standard involve less complexity\
    \ than the\n     ambiguities resulting  from  the  current  variations  in  system\n\
    \                     II. STANDARD FOR THE FORMAT\n                         OF\
    \ ARPA NETWORK MESSAGES\n          This standard supercedes the informal standards\
    \ specified in\n     ARPANET  Request for Comments numbers 561, \"Standardizing\
    \ Network\n     Mail Headers\", and 680, \"Message Transmission Protocol\".  In\
    \ this\n     document, a general framework is described.  The formal syntax is\n\
    \     then specified,  followed  by  a  discussion  of  the  semantics.\n    \
    \ Finally, a number of examples are given.\n          This specification is intended\
    \ strictly as a  definition  of\n     what is to be passed  between hosts  on\
    \ the  ARPANET.   It is NOT\n     intended to dictate either features which systems\
    \ on the  Network\n     are  expected  to support, or user interfaces to message\
    \ creating\n     or reading programs.\n          A distinction should be made\
    \ between what the  specification\n     requires  and  what it allows.  Certain\
    \ equivalences are defined,\n     such as between a space  character  <space>\
    \  and  an  end-of-line\n     character  <crlf>, which both facilitate the formal\
    \ specification\n     and indicate  what  the  OFFICIAL  semantics  are  for \
    \ messages.\n     Particular   implementations   may   wish   to  preserve  further\n\
    \     distinctions which the specification does not require.\n     A. FRAMEWORK\n\
    \          Since there are many message systems which exist outside the\n    \
    \ ARPANET environment, as well as those within it, it may be useful\n     to consider\
    \ the general framework, and resulting capabilities and\n     limitations, of\
    \ this standard.\n          Messages are expected to  consist  of  lines  of \
    \ text.   No\n     special provisions are made, at this time, for encoding drawings,\n\
    \     facimile, speech, or structured text.\n          No significant consideration\
    \ has been given to questions  of\n     data   compression   or   transmission/storage\
    \  efficiency.   The\n     standard, in fact, tends to be very free with the number\
    \ of  bits\n     consumed.   For  example, field names are specified as free text,\n\
    \     rather than special terse codes.\n          A general \"memo\" framework\
    \ is  used.   That  is,  a  message\n     specified  in this document.  The syntax\
    \ of several fields of the\n     rigidly-formated  (\"header\")   section   is\
    \   defined   in   this\n     specification;  some of the header fields must be\
    \ included in all\n     messages.  In addition to the fields specified in this\
    \  document,\n     it  is  expected  that  other fields will gain common use.\
    \  User-\n     defined header fields allow systems to extend their functionality\n\
    \     while  maintaining  a uniform framework.  Our approach is similar\n    \
    \ to that of the TELNET protocol, in that we are defining  a  basic\n     standard\
    \ which includes a mechanism  for  (optionally)  extending\n     itself.    The\
    \   authors  of  this  document  will  regulate  the\n     publishing of specifications\
    \ for these extensions.\n          Such a framework severely  constrains  document\
    \  \"tone\"  and\n     appearance  and  is  primarily useful for most intra-organization\n\
    \     communications  and  relatively   structured   inter-organization\n    \
    \ communication.   A more robust environment might allow for multi-\n     font,\
    \ multi-color, multi-dimension encoding  of  information.   A\n     less  robust\
    \  environment,  as  is present in most single-machine\n     message systems,\
    \ would more severely constrain the ability to add\n     fields  and the decision\
    \ to include specific fields.  Relative to\n     paper-based communication, it\
    \ is interesting  to  note  that  the\n     RECEIVER  of  a  message  can exercise\
    \ an extraordinary amount of\n     control over the message's  appearance.   The\
    \  amount  of  actual\n     control  available  to  message  receivers is contingent\
    \ upon the\n     B.  SYNTAX\n          This  syntax  is  given  in  four  parts.\
    \   The  first  part\n     describes  a  base-level lexical analyzer which feeds\
    \ the higher-\n     level parser described in the succeeding  sections.   The\
    \  second\n     part  gives  a  general  syntax  for messages and standard header\n\
    \     fields.  The third part specifies the  syntax  of  addresses.   A\n    \
    \ final  section  specifies  some general syntax which supports the\n     other\
    \ sections.\n     1.  LEXICAL ANALYSIS OF MESSAGES\n     a.  General Description\n\
    \         A message consists of headers and, optionally, a  body  (i.e.\n    \
    \     the  <message-text>).   The  <message-text>  part  is  just a\n        \
    \ sequence of  ASCII  characters;  it  is  separated  from  the\n         headers\
    \  by  a null line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding\n         the <crlf>).\n\
    \         1) Folding and unfolding of headers\n            Each header item can\
    \ be viewed as a single, logical,  long\n            line   of   ASCII   characters.\
    \    For  convenience,  this\n            conceptual  entity  can  be  split \
    \ into  a  multiple-line\n            representation (i.e., \"folded\").  The\
    \ general rule is that\n            wherever there can be <linear-white-space>\
    \ characters, you\n            can  instead  insert  a  <crlf> immediately followed\
    \ by AT\n            LEAST  one  <linear-white-space>  character.   Thus,   the\n\
    \            single line\n               To:  \"Joe Dokes & J. Harvey\" <ddd at\
    \ Host>, JJV at BBN\n            can be represented as\n               To:  \"\
    Joe Dokes & J. Harvey\" <ddd at Host>,\n                    JJV at BBN\n     \
    \       and\n               To:  \"Joe Dokes & J. Harvey\"\n                 \
    \               <ddd at Host>,\n      1. Lexical Analysis\n            and\n \
    \              To:  \"Joe Dokes\n                & J. Harvey\" <ddd at Host>,\
    \ JJV at BBN\n            The process  of  moving  from  this  folded  multiple-line\n\
    \            representation  of  a  header  field  to  its  single line\n    \
    \        representation will be called \"unfolding\".   Unfolding  is\n      \
    \      accomplished by regarding <crlf> immediately followed by a\n          \
    \  <linear-white-space-char> as equivalent  to  the  <linear-\n            white-space-char>.\n\
    \         2) Structure of header fields\n            Once header fields have been\
    \ unfolded, they may be  viewed\n            as  being  composed  of  a  <field-name>\
    \ followed by a \":\"\n            (colon), followed by  a  <field-body>.   The\
    \  <field-name>\n            must  be  composed  of  printable  ASCII characters\
    \ (i.e.,\n            characters which have decimal values between 33  and  126)\n\
    \            and <linear-white-space> characters.  The <field-body> may\n    \
    \        composed of any ASCII  characters  (other  than  <cr>  and\n        \
    \    <lf>, which have been removed by unfolding).\n            Certain header\
    \ fields may be interpreted according  to  an\n            internal  syntax  which\
    \  some  systems  may wish to parse.\n            These fields will be referred\
    \  to  as  structured  fields.\n            Examples  include  fields  containing\
    \ dates and addresses.\n            Other fields, such as  the  subject  field,\
    \  are  regarded\n            simply as a single line of text.\n         3) Field\
    \ names\n            To aid in the creation and reading of  <field-name>s,  the\n\
    \            free   insertion  of  <linear-white-space>  characters  is\n    \
    \        allowed in reasonable places.  Rather than  obscuring  the\n        \
    \    syntax  specification  for  <field-name> with the explicit\n            syntax\
    \  for  these  <linear-white-space>  characters,  the\n            existence \
    \ of a simple \"lexical\" analyzer is assumed.  The\n            analyzer reinterprets\
    \ the unfolded  text  which  comprises\n            the  <field-name>  as  a \
    \ sequence of <atoms> separated by\n            <linear-white-space> characters.\
    \  The field  name  may  be\n            conveniently  represented  by the sequence\
    \ of these atoms,\n      1. Lexical Analysis\n         4) Field bodies\n     \
    \       To aid in the creation and reading  of  structured fields,\n         \
    \   the  free  insertion of <linear-white-space> characters is\n            allowed\
    \ in reasonable places.  Rather than  obscuring  the\n            syntax specifications\
    \ for  these  structured  fields  with\n            explicit syntax for these\
    \ <linear-white-space> characters,\n            the existence of  another  simple\
    \  \"lexical\"  analyzer  is\n            assumed.   It  provides  an interpretation\
    \ of the unfolded\n            text comprising the body of the field  as  a  sequence\
    \  of\n            lexical symbols.  These include\n                    -  individual\
    \ special characters\n                    -  quoted strings\n                \
    \    -  comments\n                    -  atoms\n            The first three symbols\
    \ are  self-delimiting.   Atoms  are\n            not;  they  therefore are delimited\
    \ by the self-delimiting\n            symbols and by <linear-white-space>.\n \
    \           So, for example, the folded body of an address field\n           \
    \         \":sysmail\"@ Some-Host,\n                    Muhammed(I am the greatest)Ali\
    \ at WBA\n            is analyzed into the following lexical symbols and types:\n\
    \                    \":sysmail\"              quoted string\n               \
    \     @                       special\n                    Some-Host         \
    \      atom\n                    ,                       special\n           \

    \   1) Comments\n            Comments  may  appear   only   within   <field-body>s\
    \   of\n            structured fields.   A  comment is any set of TELNET ASCII\n\
    \            characters, which is not within a quoted string, and which\n    \
    \        is  enclosed in matching parentheses; parentheses nest, so\n        \
    \    that if a left paren occurs in  a  comment  string,  there\n            must\
    \ also be a matching right paren.\n            Comments are NOT passed to the\
    \ FTP server, as  part  of  a\n            MAIL  or  MLFL command, since comments\
    \ are not part of the\n            \"formal\" address.\n         2) \"White space\"\
    \n            Remember that in structured fields, MULTIPLE LINEAR  WHITE\n   \
    \         SPACE TELNET ASCII CHARACTERS (namely <tab>s and <space>s)\n       \
    \     ARE TREATED AS SINGLE SPACES AND MAY FREELY  SURROUND  ANY\n           \
    \ SYMBOL.   In  all  header  fields, at least one <space> is\n            REQUIRED\
    \ only at the beginning of folded lines.\n            Writers of mail-sending\
    \ (i.e.  header generating) programs\n            should realize that there is\
    \ no Network-wide definition of\n            the  effect  of  <tab>  TELNET  ASCII\
    \  characters  on  the\n            appearance of text at another Network host;\
    \ therefore, the\n            use of <tab>s in message  headers,  though  permitted,\
    \  is\n            discouraged.\n            Note that the contents of messages\
    \ are required to conform\n            with  TELNET  NVT conventions (e.g.  <cr>\
    \ must be followed\n            by either <lf>, making a <crlf>, or <null>, if\
    \ the <cr> is\n            to stand alone).\n         3) Quoted strings\n    \
    \        Where  permitted  (i.e.,  in  structured  fields)   quoted\n        \
    \    strings  are  treated as a single symbol (i.e.  equivalent\n            to\
    \ an <atom> syntactically).  However, if  quoted  strings\n            are  to\
    \  be  \"folded\" onto multiple lines, then the syntax\n            for folding\
    \ must be  adhered  to  (See  items  II.B.1.a.1,\n            above,  and  II.B.1.c.6,\
    \  below.)  Note  that the official\n            semantics do not  encounter \
    \ <crlf>s  in  quoted  strings,\n            although  particular  parsing  programs\
    \  may  wish to note\n      1. Lexical Analysis\n         4) Bracketing characters\n\
    \            There are two types of brackets which must be well nested:\n    \
    \            - Parentheses are used to indicate comments.\n                - Angle\
    \ brackets  (\"<\"  and  \">\")  are  used\n                  where  there is\
    \ a question of the presence\n                  of machine-usable code (e.g. \
    \ deliminating\n                  mailboxes).\n         5) Case independence of\
    \ certain specials <atom>s\n            It should be assumed by all  mail  reading\
    \  programs  that\n            certain  <atom>s  can be represented in any combination\
    \ of\n            upper and lower case.  These are:\n                - <field-name>s,\n\
    \                - \"File\", in a <path>,\n                - \"at\", in an <at-indicator>,\n\

    \        - <string-month>s, and\n                - <time-zone>s\n            For\
    \ example, the <field-name>s \"From\", \"FROM\", \"from\", and\n            even\
    \ \"FroM\" should all be treated identically.  Note that,\n            at the\

    \         6) Folding long lines\n            Each header item (field of the message)\
    \ may be represented\n            on  exactly  one  line consisting of the name\
    \ of the field\n            and its body, and this  is  what  the  parser  sees.\
    \   For\n            readability,  it  is  recommended  that  the  <field-body>\n\
    \            portion of long header items  be  \"folded\"  onto  multiple\n  \
    \          lines of the actual header.\n         7) Backspace characters\n   \
    \         Backspace TELNET ASCII characters (ASCII  BS,  decimal  8)\n       \
    \     may  be  included  in  <text-line>  and <quoted-string> to\n           \
    \ effect overstriking; however, any use of backspaces  which\n            effects\
    \  an overstrike to the left of the beginning of the\n            <text-line>\
    \ or <quoted-string> is prohibited.\n      2. Messages\n     2.  GENERAL SYNTAX\
    \ OF MESSAGES:\n         NOTE: The syntax indicates that items  in  <required-headers>\n\
    \         must  be  in  a  specific  order and precede all other header\n    \
    \     items.  Header fields, in fact, are NOT required to occur  in\n        \
    \ any  particular  order.  Required header items must be unique\n         (occur\
    \ exactly once).  This  specification  permits  multiple\n         occurrences\
    \   of   most   optional   fields.    However,  the\n         interpretation of\

    \ Fields\n     C. SEMANTICS\n     1. ADDRESS FIELDS\n     a. General\n       \
    \ 1) <path>s are used to refer to a location,  on  the  ARPANET,\n           containing\
    \  a  stored  address  list.   The <phrase> should\n           contain text which\
    \ the referenced host  can  resolve  to  a\n           file.   This  standard\
    \  is  not  a protocol and so does not\n           prescribe HOW data  is  to\
    \  be  retrieved  from  the  file.\n           However, the following requirements\
    \ are made:\n           - the   file  must  be  accessible  through  the   local\n\
    \             operating  system  interface  (if  it  exists),  given\n       \
    \      adequate user access rights; and\n           - if a host has an FTP server\
    \ and  a  user  is  able  to\n             retrieve  any  files  from the host\
    \ using that server,\n             then the file must be accessible  through \
    \ FTP,  using\n             DEFAULT  transfer settings, given adequate user access\n\
    \             rights.\n           It is intended that this mechanism will allow\
    \  programs  to\n           retrieve such lists automatically.\n           The\
    \ interpretation  of  a  <path>  follows.   This  is  not\n           intended\
    \ to imply any particular implementation scheme, but\n           is included to\
    \ aid in understanding the notion of <path>s:\n           - The contents of the\
    \ file indicated by a <path-name> is\n             treated  as  an  <address-list>\
    \  and is inserted as an\n             <address-item> in the position of the <path-name>\
    \ item\n             in  the  syntax.   That is, the TELNET ASCII character\n\
    \             string of the <path-name> or, if present,  the  <path-\n       \
    \      list>  containing  it,  is replaced by the contents of\n             the\
    \ file to which the <path-name>  refers.  Therefore,\n             the  contents\
    \  of  the file indicated by a <path-name>\n             must be syntactically\
    \ self-contained and  must  adhere\n             to  the  full  syntax  prescribed\
    \ herein for <address-\n             list>.\n           - <Path-item>s of a <path-list>\
    \ are alternates  and  the\n             contents  of ONLY ONE of them is to be\
    \ included in the\n             resultant address list.\n      1. Address Fields\n\
    \           TENEX systems do not now understand addresses of  the  form\n    \
    \       \"P.  D.  Q.  Bach\", but another system might).\n           Note that\
    \ a <mailbox> is a conceptual entity which does not\n           necessarily  pertain\
    \  to  file  storage.  For example, some\n           sites may choose to print\
    \ mail on their  line  printer  and\n           deliver the output to the addressee's\
    \ desk.\n           A user may have several mailboxes. The use  of  the  second\n\
    \           alternative  of  <mach-addr-item>  (<phrase>  \"<\" <mailbox-\n  \
    \         list> \">\") indicates that a copy of the message  is  to  be\n    \
    \       sent to EACH mailbox named.\n        3) <any-name>  may  contain  any\
    \  sequence  of  \"words\".  This\n           sequence  of  words,  used as an\
    \ <address-item>, is used to\n           facilitate reference  to  non-standard\
    \  (e.g.  non-Network)\n           addresses.    Such   an  address  might  be\
    \  one  which  is\n           acceptable to the U.S.  Postal Service.\n      \
    \  4) The <host-name> in a <host-phrase>  must  be  THE  official\n          \
    \ name of a Network host, or else a decimal number indicating\n           the\
    \ Network address for that host.  The USE OF  NUMBERS  IS\n           STRONGLY\
    \  DISCOURAGED  and  is  permitted  only  due to the\n           occasional necessity\
    \ of bypassing local host-name tables.\n           The  <phrase>  in  a  <host-phrase>\
    \  is  intended   to   be\n           meaningful only to the indicated host. \
    \ To all other hosts,\n           the <phrase> is treated  as  a  literal  string.\
    \   No  case\n           transformations  should be (automatically) performed\
    \ on the\n           <phrase>.  The <phrase> is passed to the local host's  mail\n\
    \           sending   program;   it   is   the  responsibility  of  the\n    \
    \       destination host's mail receiving (distribution) program to\n        \
    \   perform  case  mapping  on  this  <phrase>, if required, to\n           deliver\
    \ the mail.\n     b. Originator Fields\n           WARNING: The standard allows\

    \ should default this field to be  a  single  machine\n           address,  indicating\
    \  the user entering the message; if and\n           only if this is done,  the\
    \  \"Sender:\"  field  need  not  be\n           present.\n        2) Sender:\n\
    \           This field contains the identity of the  person  who  sends\n    \
    \       the  message.   It need not be present in the header of the\n        \
    \   message if it is the SAME as the \"From:\" field.\n           The <sender-field-body>\
    \  includes  a  <phrase>  which  must\n           correspond  to  a  user,  rather\
    \  than a standard <address-\n           item>, to indicate the  expectation \
    \ that  the  field  will\n           refer  to  the  PERSON responsible for sending\
    \ the mail and\n           not simply include the name of a mailbox,  from  which\
    \  the\n           mail  was  sent.  For example in the case of a shared login\n\
    \           name, the name, by itself,  would  not  be  adequate.   The\n    \
    \       <phrase>  (user)  is  a  system  entity,  not a generalized\n        \
    \   person reference.\n        3) Reply-to:\n           This field provides a\
    \ general mechanism for indicating  any\n           mailbox(es)  to  which  responses\
    \  are  to  be sent.  Three\n           different uses for this feature can be\
    \  distinguished.   In\n           the  first  case,  the  author(s)  may  not\
    \  have   regular\n           machine-based  mailboxes  and therefore wish to\
    \ indicate an\n           alternate machine address.  In the second case,  an\
    \  author\n           may  wish  additional  persons  to  be  made  aware  of,\
    \ or\n           responsible for, responses; responders  should  send  their\n\
    \           replies  to  the \"Reply-to:\" mailbox(es).  More interesting\n  \
    \         is a case such as text-message teleconferencing in which an\n      \
    \     automatic distribution facility  is  provided  and  a  user\n          \
    \ submitting  an  \"entry\" for distribution only needs to send\n           their\
    \ message to the mailbox(es) indicated in  the  \"Reply-\n           to:\" field.\n\
    \           If there is no <reply-to-field>, then the <from-field> MUST\n    \
    \       contain  AT  LEAST  ONE machine address.  In all cases when\n        \
    \   used and even if a <sender> field is present, the  Reply-to\n           field\
    \ must contain at least one machine address.\n        NOTE: For systems which\
    \ automatically generate  address  lists\n      1. Address Fields\n          \
    \ - The receiver, when replying to a message,  must  NEVER\n             automatically\
    \  include  the <sender-field-body> in the\n             reply's address list\n\
    \           - If the <reply-to-field> exists, then the reply  should\n       \
    \      go ONLY to the <reply-to-field-body> addressees.\n        (Extensive  examples\
    \  are  provided  in  Section  II.D.)  This\n        recommendation is intended\
    \ only for <originator-field>s and in\n        no way is intended to reflect that\
    \ replies should not be sent,\n        also,  to  the  other recipients of this\
    \ message.  It is up to\n        the respective mail handling programs as  to\
    \  what  additional\n        facilities will be provided.\n     c. Receiver Fields\n\
    \        1) To:\n           This field contains the identity of the primary  recipients\n\
    \           of the message.\n        2) cc:\n           This  field  contains\
    \  the  identity   of   the   secondary\n           recipients of the message.\n\
    \        3) Bcc:\n           This field contains the identity of  additional \
    \ recipients\n           of  the  message  who are to remain hidden from the primary\n\
    \           and secondary  recipients.   Some  systems  may  choose  to\n    \
    \       include   the   text  of  the  \"Bcc:\"  field  only  in  the\n      \
    \     author(s)'s copy, while others may include it in  the  text\n          \
    \ sent to all those indicated in the \"Bcc:\" list.\n        4) Fcc:\n       \
    \    This field contains the identity of any  message  files  in\n           which\
    \  copies  of  this  message  are  being  placed by the\n           originator.\
    \  Note that the presence of this field does  NOT\n           guarantee  long-term\
    \  availability of the message in any of\n           the indicated files.\n  \
    \    2. Reference Specification Fields\n     2. REFERENCE SPECIFICATION FIELDS\n\
    \     a. Message-Id:\n        This field contains a  unique  identifier  (the\
    \  <phrase>)  to\n        refer  to this version of this message.  The uniqueness\
    \ of the\n        message  identifier  is  guaranteed  by   each   host.    This\n\
    \        identifier  is  intended  to  be  machine  readable,  and  not\n    \
    \    necessarily meaningful to humans.  A  message-id  pertains  to\n        exactly\
    \  one instantiation of a particular message; subsequent\n        revisions to\
    \ the message should receive new message-id's.\n     b. In-Reply-To:\n       \
    \ The contents of this field  identify  previous  correspondence\n        which\
    \  this  message answers.  If message identifiers are used\n        in this field,\
    \ they should be enclosed in angle brackets (<>).\n     c. References:\n     \
    \   The contents of this field identify other correspondence which\n        this\
    \  message  references.   If  message identifiers are used,\n        they should\
    \ be enclosed in angle brackets (<>).\n     d. Keywords:\n        This field contains\
    \ keywords or phrases, separated by commas.\n     3. OTHER FIELDS AND SYNTACTIC\
    \ ITEMS\n     a. Subject:\n        The  \"subject:\"  field  is  intended  to\
    \   provide   as   much\n        information  as  necessary to adequately summarize\
    \ or indicate\n        the nature of the message.\n     b. Comments:\n       \
    \ Permits  adding  text  comments  onto  the   message   without\n        disturbing\
    \ the contents of the message's body.\n      4. Dates\n     4. DATES\n       \
    \ It is recommended that,  because  of  differing  international\n        interpretations,\
    \  the  <string-day>  option be used instead of\n        the <slash-day> option\
    \ in the specification of a <day>.\n        If included, <day-of-week> must be\
    \  the  day  implied  by  the\n        <date> specification.\n        <Time-zones>\
    \ allow reference to Greenwich and to each  of  the\n        zones  in  the  United\
    \  States.  The zone references beginning\n        with \"A\" are for Atlantic\
    \ time which are one hour faster  than\n        the  corresponding Eastern times.\
    \  \"Y\" indicates Yukon time in\n        Alaska, which  is  one  hour  slower\
    \  than  the  corresponding\n        Pacific times, and \"H\" indicates Hawaiian\
    \ times, which are two\n     D. EXAMPLES\n     1. ADDRESSES\n     a. Alfred E.\
    \ Newman <Newman at BBN-TENEXA>\n        Newman@BBN-TENEXA\n        These  two\
    \  \"Alfred  E.   Newman\"  examples   have   identical\n        semantics,  as\
    \ far as the operation of the local host's mailer\n        and the remote host's\
    \ FTP server are concerned.  In the  first\n        example,  the \"Alfred E.\
    \  Newman\" is ignored by the mailer, as\n        \"Newman at BBN-TENEXA\"  completely\
    \  specifies  the  recipient.\n        The  second  example contains no superfluous\
    \ information, and,\n        again, \"Newman@BBN-TENEXA\" is the intended recipient.\n\
    \     b. Al Newman at BBN-TENEXA\n        This is identical with \"Al Newman<Al\
    \ Newman  at  BBN-TENEXA>.\"\n        That is, the full <phrase>, \"Al Newman\"\
    , is passed to the  FTP\n        server.   Note  that  not  all  FTP  servers\
    \ accept multi-word\n        identifiers; and some that do accept them will treat\
    \ each word\n        as  a  different addressee (in this case, attempting to send\
    \ a\n        copy of the message to \"Al\" and a copy to \"Newman\").\n     c.\
    \ \"George Lovell, Ted Hackle\" <Shared-Mailbox at Office-1>\n        This form\
    \ might be used to indicate that a single  mailbox  is\n        shared  by several\
    \ users.  The quoted string is ignored by the\n        originating host's mailer,\
    \  as  \"Shared-Mailbox  at  Office-1\"\n        completely specifies the destination\
    \ mailbox.\n     d. Wilt (the Stilt) Chamberlain at NBA\n        The \"(the Stilt)\"\
    \ is a comment, which is NOT included  in  the\n        destination mailbox address\
    \ handed to the originating system's\n        mailer.  The address is the string\
    \  \"Wilt  Chamberlain\",  with\n        exactly  one  space  between the first\
    \ and second words.  (The\n        quotation marks are not included.)\n     2.\

    \             Port at Portugal;;,\n            Jones at SEA\n        This group\
    \ list example points out the use  of  comments,  the\n        nesting  of  groups,\
    \  and  the mixing of addresses and groups.\n        Note that the two consecutive\
    \ semi-colons  preceding \"Jones at\n        SEA\" mean that Jones is NOT a member\
    \ of the Gourmets group.\n     3. ORIGINATOR ITEMS\n     a. George Jones logs\
    \ into his Host as  \"Jones\".   He  sends  mail\n        himself.\n         \
    \   From:  Jones at Host\n        or\n            From:  George Jones <Jones at\

    \        logs  in  as  Secy  on  her  Host  (SHost) sends mail for him.\n    \
    \    Replies to the mail should go to George, of course.\n            From:  \
    \  George Jones <Jones at Host>\n            Sender:  Secy at SHost\n     c. George\
    \ Jones logs in as Group at Host.  He sends mail himself;\n        replies should\
    \ go to the Group mailbox.\n            From:  George Jones <Group at Host>\n\
    \     d. George Jones' secretary sends mail for George in his  capacity\n    \
    \    as a member of Group while logged in as Secy at Host.  Replies\n        should\
    \ go to Group.\n            From:   George Jones<Group at Host>\n            Sender:\
    \ Secy at Host\n        Note that there need not be a space between  \"Jones\"\
    \  and  the\n        \"<\",  but  adding a space enhances readability (as is the\
    \ case\n        in other examples).\n     e. George Jones asks his secretary \
    \ (Secy  at  Host)  to  send  a\n        message  for  him  in  his  capacity\

    \  himself   in   the\n        enumeration  of  Big-committee,  he  would  not\
    \  have gotten a\n        reply; the presence of the \"Reply-to:\"  field  SUPERSEDES\
