  - "Abstract\n   The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be carried\
    \ out\n   by various persons or entities.  The RFC Editor model presented in\n\
    \   this document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into\n   four\
    \ functions: The RFC Series Editor, the Independent Submission\n   Editor, the\
    \ RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher.  It also\n   introduces the RFC\
    \ Series Advisory Group and an (optional)\n   Independent Submission Stream Editorial\
    \ Board.  The model outlined\n   here is intended to increase flexibility and\
    \ operational support\n   options, provide for the orderly succession of the RFC\
    \ Editor, and\n   ensure the continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC\n\
    \   quality and timely processing, ensuring document accessibility,\n   reducing\
    \ costs, and increasing cost transparency.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community,\
    \ is concerned\n   with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series, orderly RFC\
    \ Editor\n   succession, maintaining RFC quality, and RFC document accessibility.\n\
    \   The IAB is also sensitive to the concerns of the IETF Administrative\n   Oversight\
    \ Committee (IAOC) about providing the necessary services in\n   a cost-effective\
    \ and efficient manner.\n   The definition of the RFC series is described in RFC\
    \ 4844 [1].\n   Section 3.1 of RFC 4844 defines \"RFC Editor\":\n | 3.1. RFC Editor\n\
    \ |\n |  Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC\n |\
    \  Series (the RFC Editor).  The task has grown, and the work now\n |  requires\
    \ the organized activity of several experts, so there are RFC\n |  Editors, or\
    \ an RFC Editor organization.  In time, there may be\n |  multiple organizations\
    \ working together to undertake the work\n |  required by the RFC Series.  For\
    \ simplicity's sake, and without\n |  attempting to predict how the role might\
    \ be subdivided among them,\n |  this document refers to this collection of experts\
    \ and organizations\n |  as the \"RFC Editor\".\n |\n |  The RFC Editor is an\
    \ expert technical editor and series editor,\n |  acting to support the mission\
    \ of the RFC Series.  As such, the RFC\n |  Editor is the implementer handling\
    \ the editorial management of the\n |  RFC Series, in accordance with the defined\
    \ processes.  In addition,\n |  the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and\
    \ prime mover in\n |  discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and\
    \ archiving\n |  RFCs.\n   RFC 4844 makes no attempt to explore the internal organization\
    \ of the\n   RFC Editor.  However, RFC 4844 envisions changes in the RFC Editor\n\
    \   organizational structure.  In discussion with the Internet community,\n  \
    \ the IAB considered changes that increase flexibility and operational\n   support\
    \ options, provide for the orderly succession of the RFC\n   Editor, and ensure\
    \ the continuity of the RFC series, while\n   maintaining RFC quality and timely\
    \ processing, ensuring document\n   accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing\
    \ cost transparency.  The\n   model set forth below is the result of those discussions,\
    \ and\n   examines the internal organization of the RFC Editor, while remaining\n\
    \   consistent with RFC 4844.\n   Note that RFC 4844 uses the term \"RFC Editor\
    \ function\" or \"RFC\n   Editor\" as the collective set of responsibilities for\
    \ which this memo\n   provides a model for internal organization.  This memo introduces\
    \ the\n   term \"RFC Series Editor\" or \"Series Editor\" for one of the\n   organizational\
    \ components.\n   While the IAB approved the initial version of this RFC Editor\
    \ model\n   on October 1, 2008, the model has received clarifications since. \
    \ It\n   should be noted that the publication of the document as an RFC does\n\
    \   not cast the model in stone, as the primary purpose of this document,\n  \
    \ throughout the publication process, is to encourage normal community\n   review\
    \ in order to ascertain consensus to work to this model as a\n   first step. \
    \ The document, and the resulting structures, will be\n   modified as needed through\
    \ normal procedures.  The IAB will continue\n   to monitor discussions within\
    \ the community about potential\n   adjustments to the RFC Editor model and recognizes\
    \ that the process\n   described in this document may need to be adjusted to align\
    \ with any\n   changes that result from such discussions, hence the version number\n\
    \   in the title.\n   In particular, the document will be reviewed after the various\n\
    \   transition periods and mechanisms specified in this version are\n   completed.\n"
- title: 2.  IAOC Implementation
  contents:
  - "2.  IAOC Implementation\n   The model is constructed in such a way that it allows\
    \ for all these\n   functions to be implemented jointly or under separate contractual\n\
    \   arrangements.  In fact, a bidder could put together a proposal that\n   includes\
    \ one or more subcontractors.  The reporting structure will\n   depend on the\
    \ manner that the contracts are awarded, and they are\n   subject to change over\
    \ time.  As a result, the model describes only\n   responsibilities, procedures,\
    \ and process.  The exact implementation\n   is a responsibility of the IAOC.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Expenses for the RFC Editor
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Expenses for the RFC Editor\n   The expenses discussed in this document\
    \ are not new expenses.  They\n   are part of the IASA budget.  Today, these expenses\
    \ are part of the\n   RFC Editor contract with the University of Southern California's\n\
    \   Information Sciences Institute.\n"

- title: 3.1.  RFC Series Editor
  contents:
  - "3.1.  RFC Series Editor\n   The RFC Series Editor is an individual who may have\
    \ assistants and\n   who will regularly be provided support from an advisory group\
    \ (see\n   Section 4.1).  The RSE is responsible for:\n   1.  Identifying appropriate\
    \ steps for RFC Series continuity;\n   2.  Exercising executive-level management\
    \ over the implementation of\n       policies, processes, and procedures established\
    \ to ensure the\n       quality and consistency for the RFC Series.  The RFC Series\n\
    \       Editor will work with the RSAG, and, where appropriate, the IAB\n    \
    \   and IAOC to develop new policy and see that contractual\n       agreements\
    \ are met;\n   3.  Taking proposed changes to the community, and working with\
    \ the\n       IAB so that the IAB can ensure that there is sufficient community\n\
    \       review before significant policies or policy changes are adopted;\n  \
    \ 4.  Coordinating with the IAB and/or IAOC and, together with the IAB\n     \
    \  and/or IAOC, participating in reviews of the RFC Publisher, RFC\n       Production\
    \ Center, and Independent Submission Editor functions to\n       ensure the above-mentioned\
    \ continuity;\n   5.  Developing, maintaining, and publishing the RFC Style Manual\
    \ for\n       use by authors, editors, the stream managers, the RFC Production\n\
    \       Center, and the RFC Publisher;\n   6.  Managing the RFC errata process;\n\
    \   7.  Liaising with the IAB;\n   8.  Overseeing consistency of RFCs with the\
    \ RFC Series and RFC Style\n       Manual.\n   There are many potential issues\
    \ with respect to RFC Series\n   continuity.  To name a few: look and feel of\
    \ the series, indexing\n   methodologies, accessibility of the publications, IPR\
    \ and copyright\n   issues, and formatting issues.  After identifying the appropriate\n\
    \   steps to address such issues, the implementation of those steps\n   resides\
    \ mostly with the RFC production and publishing functions.\n   Since the IAOC\
    \ maintains oversight of the implementation, the RFC\n   Series Editor is expected\
    \ to be invited and to participate in reviews\n   of that implementation.\n  \
    \ The RFC Series Editor is a senior technology professional with the\n   following\
    \ qualifications:\n   1.  Strong understanding of the IETF and RFC process.\n\
    \   2.  Executive management experience suitable to managing the\n       requirements\
    \ outlined elsewhere in this document and the many\n       aspects of this role,\
    \ and to coordinating the overall RFC Editor\n       process.\n   3.  Good understanding\
    \ of the English language and technical\n       terminology related to the Internet.\n\
    \   4.  Good communication skills.\n   5.  Experience with editorial processes.\n\
    \   6.  Independent worker.\n   7.  Experience as an RFC author desired.\n   There\
    \ are alternative selection methods for selecting the individual\n   to serve\
    \ as the RFC Series Editor:\n   The first alternative involves a Request for Proposal\
    \ (RFP) process\n   run by the IAOC.  The IAOC would seek a person with the listed\n\
    \   qualifications in a broadly distributed RFP.  The winner would be\n   selected\
    \ by the IAOC in consultation with the IAB, and then, the IAOC\n   would contract\
    \ for the services.  Contract terms, including length of\n   contract, extensions,\
    \ and renewals, shall be as provided in the RFP.\n   The opportunity to bid shall\
    \ be broadly available.  Fees and expenses\n   to support the administrative operation\
    \ of the RFC Series Editor\n   would be part of the awarded contract and be part\
    \ of the IASA budget.\n   The second alternative involves a nomination and confirmation\n\
    \   process.  Candidates are nominated, and then an individual with the\n   listed\
    \ qualifications is selected by the Internet community and\n   confirmed by the\
    \ IAB.  An approach similar to the one used by the IAB\n   to select an IAOC member\
    \ every other year (as described in\n   Appendix A) will be used.  Once the selection\
    \ is made, a contract\n   will be negotiated between the person selected and the\
    \ IAOC,\n   following the general model above.  Financial compensation and\n \
    \  expenses to support the administrative operation of the RFC Series\n   Editor\
    \ selected in this manner would be part of the IASA budget.\n   Based on an Request\
    \ for Information (RFI) issued by the IAOC in\n   December 2008, the IAOC recommended\
    \ that the second alternative is\n   chosen for the selection cycle to be completed\
    \ in 2009.\n"

- title: 4.1.1.  Charter
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Charter\n   The purpose of the RSAG is to provide expert, informed guidance\n\
    \   (chiefly, to the RSE) in matters affecting the RFC Series operation\n   and\
    \ development.  Such matters include, but are not limited to,\n   issues in operation\
    \ of the RFC model components, and consideration of\n   additional RFC streams,\
    \ to give a sense of the range of topics\n   covered.\n   The RSAG is chartered\
    \ by the IAB.  As such, it operates independently\n   of the IAB to fulfill that\
    \ charter, and provides periodic reports to\n   the IAB via the RSE.\n   The group\
    \ provides guidance to the RSE, who in turn addresses\n   immediate operational\
    \ issues or opportunities with the ISE,\n   Production Center, or Publisher. \
    \ In cases where these issues have\n   contractual side-effects, the RSE provides\
    \ guidance to the IETF\n   Administrative Director (IAD).  The RSAG also serves\
    \ to provide\n   advice to the RSE on longer-term, larger-scale developments for\
    \ the\n   RFC Series.  This informs the proposals the RSE takes to the\n   community\
    \ for discussion, and the IAD/IAOC as proposals for\n   implementation.\n   The\
    \ RSAG will assist the RSE in identifying and leading community\n   discussion\
    \ of important issues and opportunities facing the RFC\n   Series.  The IAB retains\
    \ its oversight role and is responsible for\n   ensuring that adequate community\
    \ discussion has been held on any such\n   significant topics.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Membership
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Membership\n   The RSAG full members are all at-large members, selected\
    \ for their\n   experience and interest in the RFC Series, to provide consistency\
    \ and\n   constancy of the RFC Series interpretation over time; the members do\n\
    \   not represent a particular RFC stream or any organizations.  In\n   particular,\
    \ there is no requirement or expectation that RSAG members\n   will be IAB members.\
    \  The RSAG members are proposed by the Series\n   Editor in consultation with\
    \ the sitting RSAG members, and then\n   confirmed and formally appointed by the\
    \ IAB.  In addition to these\n   full members, each RFC stream approver will appoint\
    \ a liaison to the\n   RSAG to provide context specific to their stream.  The\
    \ liaisons do\n   not have to be members of the stream approval bodies.  Initially,\n\
    \   there will be no IAOC or IAB liaison for their oversight role;\n   however,\
    \ as experience is gained, the IAOC, IAB, or RSAG may request\n   such liaisons.\n\
    \   The RSAG does not select or appoint the RSE, or any other component\n   of\
    \ the RFC Editor model, although it acts as an important resource\n   for informing\
    \ any selection process.\n   It is envisioned that the RSAG will be composed of\
    \ appointed full\n   members serving staggered 3 year terms, plus the RSE.  The\
    \ full\n   members will serve at the pleasure of the IAB -- appointed by the\n\
    \   IAB, and if necessary, removed by the IAB.\n   In order to provide continuity\
    \ and to assist with a smooth transition\n   of the RFC Editor function, the members\
    \ of the existing RFC Editor\n   Editorial Board who are willing to do so are\
    \ asked to serve as an\n   interim RSAG, effective as of the time of approval\
    \ of this document.\n   Within one year from the time the RFC Editor function\
    \ transitions to\n   the new model and after consideration of the operation of\
    \ the new\n   model in practice, the interim RSAG and RSE will formulate\n   recommendations\
    \ to the IAB about this model, regarding the regular\n   composition, size, and\
    \ selection process for the permanent RSAG in\n   particular.\n"
- title: 4.1.3.  Disagreements among RFC Editor Entities
  contents:
  - "4.1.3.  Disagreements among RFC Editor Entities\n   If during the execution of\
    \ their activities, a disagreement arises\n   over an implementation decision\
    \ made by one of the entities in the\n   model, any relevant party should first\
    \ request a review and\n   reconsideration of the decision.  If that party still\
    \ disagrees after\n   the reconsideration, that party may ask the RSE to decide\
    \ or,\n   especially if the RSE is involved, that party may ask the IAB Chair\n\
    \   (for a technical or procedural matter) or IAD (for an administrative\n   or\
    \ contractual one) to mediate or appoint a mediator to aid in the\n   discussions,\
    \ although neither is obligated to do so.  All parties\n   should work informally\
    \ and in good faith to reach a mutually\n   agreeable conclusion.\n   If such\
    \ a conclusion is not possible through those informal\n   processes, then the\
    \ matter must be registered with the RFC Series\n   Advisory Group.  The RSAG\
    \ may choose to offer advice to the RSE or\n   more general advice to the parties\
    \ involved and may ask the RSE to\n   defer a decision until it formulates its\
    \ advice.  However, if a\n   timely decision cannot be reached through discussion,\
    \ mediation, and\n   mutual agreement, the Series Editor is expected to make whatever\n\
    \   decisions are needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the RFC\n   Editor\
    \ function; those decisions are final.\n   RSE decisions of this type are limited\
    \ to the functioning of the\n   process and evaluation of whether current policies\
    \ are appropriately\n   implemented in the decision or need adjustment.  In particular,\
    \ it\n   should be noted that final decisions about the technical content of\n\
    \   individual documents are the exclusive responsibility of the stream\n   approvers\
    \ for those documents, as shown in the illustration in\n   Figure 1.\n   If a\
    \ disagreement or decision has immediate or future contractual\n   consequences,\
    \ the Series Editor must identify the issue to the IAOC\n   and, if the RSAG has\
    \ provided advice, forward that advice as well.\n   After the IAOC has notified\
    \ the IAB, the IAD as guided by the IAOC,\n   with advice provided by the Series\
    \ Editor, has the responsibility to\n   resolve these contractual issues.\n  \
    \ If informal agreements cannot be reached and formal RSAG review\n   and/or RSE\
    \ or stream approver decisions are required, the RSE must\n   identify the issues\
    \ involved to the community and report them to the\n   IAB in its oversight capacity.\
    \  The RSE and IAB shall mutually\n   develop a satisfactory mechanism for this\
    \ type of reporting when and\n   if it is necessary.\n   IAB and community discussion\
    \ of any patterns of disputes are expected\n   to inform future changes to Series\
    \ policies including possible\n   updates to this document.\n"

    \ RFC 4844 apply.  The\n   processes for the publication of documents must prevent\
    \ the\n   introduction of unapproved changes.  Since the RFC Editor maintains\n\
    \   the index of publications, sufficient security must be in place to\n   prevent\
    \ these published documents from being changed by external\n   parties.  The archive\
    \ of RFC documents, any source documents needed\n   to recreate the RFC documents,\
    \ and any associated original documents\n   (such as lists of errata, tools, and,\
    \ for some early items, non-\n   machine-readable originals) need to be secured\
    \ against failure of the\n   storage medium and other similar disasters.\n   The\

    \ of this RFC Editor model.\n"
