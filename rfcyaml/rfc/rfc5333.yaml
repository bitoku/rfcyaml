  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a system that
    uses DNS\n   (Domain Name System, RFC 1034 [2]) to translate telephone numbers,\n
    \  such as '+12025550100', into URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers, RFC\n   3986
    [3]), such as 'mailto:user@example.com'.  ENUM exists primarily\n   to facilitate
    the interconnection of systems that rely on telephone\n   numbers with those that
    use URIs to identify resources.  The ENUM\n   registration here could be used
    to allow phones, for example, to\n   check the free/busy status of a user in their
    address book or propose\n   a meeting with him or her from the user's phone number.\n
    \  The Guide to Internet Calendaring [10] describes the relationship\n   between
    various Internet calendaring specifications like this:\n   \"iCalendar [4] is
    the language used to describe calendar objects.\n   iTIP [5] [iCalendar Transport-Independent
    Interoperability Protocol]\n   describes a way to use the iCalendar language to
    do scheduling.  iMIP\n   [6] [iCalendar Message-Based Interoperability Protocol]
    describes how\n   to do iTIP scheduling via e-mail\".\n   Recently, another Standards
    Track protocol for calendar and\n   scheduling access has appeared.  CalDAV (Calendaring
    Extensions to\n   WebDAV) [7] is a WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and\n
    \  Versioning) [8] based mechanism for manipulating Internet calendars,\n   viewing
    free/busy lists, and via a planned scheduling extension [15],\n   could be used
    for proposing calendar events as well in the future.\n   The existing 'mailto:'
    URI scheme (defined in RFC 3986 [3]) is\n   already used to address iMIP compatible
    Calendar Services.  Likewise,\n   the existing 'http:' and 'https:' URI schemes
    (defined in RFC 2616\n   [11] and RFC 2818 [12]) are already used to address CalDAV
    compatible\n   Calendar Services.\n   This document registers Enumservices for
    scheduling and accessing\n   Internet calendaring information associated with
    an E.164 number.\n"

    scheme(s):\n      'mailto:'\n   Functional Specification:\n      This Enumservice
    indicates that the resource identified can be\n      addressed by the associated
    URI used for scheduling using Internet\n      calendaring via Internet mail with
    the iMIP [6] protocol.\n   Security considerations:\n      See Section 4.\n   Intended

    Subtypes:\n      \"http\"\n   URI scheme(s):\n      'http:'\n   Functional Specification:\n
    \     This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified can be\n      addressed
    by the associated URI in order to access a user's\n      calendar (for example
    free/busy status) using the CalDAV [7]\n      protocol for Internet calendaring.\n
    \  Security considerations:\n      See Section 4.\n   Intended usage:\n      COMMON\n
    \  Author:\n      Rohan Mahy (rohan@ekabal.com)\n   Enumservice Name:\n      \"ical-access\"\n
    \  Enumservice Type:\n      \"ical-access\"\n   Enumservice Subtypes:\n      \"https\"\n
    \  URI scheme(s):\n      'https:'\n   Functional Specification:\n      This Enumservice
    indicates that the resource identified can be\n      addressed by the associated
    URI in order to access a user's\n      calendar (for example free/busy status)
    using the CalDAV [7]\n      protocol for Internet calendaring.\n   Security considerations:\n
    \     See Section 4.\n   Intended usage:\n      COMMON\n   Author:\n      Rohan
    Mahy (rohan@ekabal.com)\n   Note: These Enumservices use a dash \"-\" in the Type
    strings.  To\n   allow for hierarchical concepts (as required in this case), some
    kind\n   of boundary needs to be in place.  Neither RFC 3761 [1] nor its\n   intended
    successor [17] foresee the concept of sub-subtyping.  The\n   natural solution
    to address this requirement is the usage of dash \"-\"\n   in Type strings, which
    is slightly contradictory to RFC 3761 [1].\n   However, its intended successors
    [16] [17] clearly allow a dash \"-\"\n   in Type strings, so that using \"-\"
    is seen as a practical way\n   forward.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) does not make policy
    decisions about\n   which records it provides to a DNS resolver.  All DNS records
    must be\n   assumed to be available to all inquirers at all times.  The\n   information
    provided within an ENUM record set must therefore be\n   considered open to the
    public -- which is a cause for some privacy\n   considerations.\n   Revealing
    a calendaring URI by itself is unlikely to introduce many\n   privacy concerns,
    although, depending on the structure of the URI, it\n   might reveal the full
    name or employer of the target.  The use of\n   anonymous URIs mitigates this
    risk.\n   As ENUM uses DNS, which in its current form is an insecure protocol,\n
    \  there is no mechanism for ensuring that the answer returned to a\n   query
    is authentic.  An analysis of threats specific to the\n   dependence of ENUM on
    the DNS is provided in RFC 3761 [1], and a\n   thorough analysis of threats to
    the DNS itself is covered in RFC 3833\n   [14].  Many of these problems are prevented
    when the resolver\n   verifies the authenticity of answers to its ENUM queries
    via DNSSEC\n   (DNS Security, RFC 4035 [9]) in zones where it is available.\n
    \  More serious security concerns are associated with potential attacks\n   against
    an underlying calendaring system (for example, unauthorized\n   modification or
    viewing).  For this reason, iTIP discusses a number\n   of security requirements
    (detailed in RFC 2446 [5]) that call for\n   authentication, integrity and confidentiality
    properties, and similar\n   measures to prevent such attacks.  Any calendaring
    protocol used in\n   conjunction with a URI scheme currently meets these requirements.\n
    \  The use of CalDAV with the 'https:' scheme makes use of TLS\n   (Transport
    Layer Security, RFC 5246 [13]) to provide server\n   authentication, confidentiality,
    and message integrity.\n   Unlike a traditional telephone number, the resource
    identified by an\n   calendaring URI is often already guessable, and it often
    requires\n   that users provide cryptographic credentials for authentication and\n
    \  authorization before calendar data can be exchanged.  Despite the\n   public
    availability of ENUM records, the use of this information to\n   reveal an unprotected
    calendaring resource is unlikely in practice.\n"
