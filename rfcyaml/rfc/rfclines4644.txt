Abstract This memo defines an extension to the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) to provide asynchronous (otherwise known as "streaming") transfer of articles.
This allows servers to transfer articles to other servers with much greater efficiency.
This document updates and formalizes the CHECK and TAKETHIS commands specified in RFC 2980 and deprecates the MODE STREAM command.
According to the NNTP specification [NNTP], a peer uses the IHAVE command to query whether a server wants a particular article.
Because the IHAVE command cannot be pipelined, the need to stop and wait for the remote end's response greatly restricts the throughput that can be achieved.
The ad hoc CHECK and TAKETHIS commands, originally documented in [NNTP COMMON], provide an alternative method of peer to peer article transfer that permits a more effective use of network bandwidth.
Due to their proven usefulness and wide deployment, they are formalized in this specification.
The ad hoc MODE STREAM command, also documented in [NNTP COMMON], is deprecated by this specification, but due to its ubiquity is documented here for backwards compatibility.
Conventions Used in this Document
The notational conventions used in this document are the same as those in [NNTP] and any term not defined in this document has the same meaning as in that one.
The key words "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].
This document assumes you familiarity with NNTP [NNTP].
In general, the connections described below are from one peer to another, but we will continue to use "client" to mean the initiator of the NNTP connection, and "server" to mean the other endpoint.
In the examples, commands from the client are indicated with [C], and responses from the server are indicated with [S].
This extension provides three new commands: MODE STREAM, CHECK, and TAKETHIS.
The capability label for this extension is STREAMING.
The STREAMING extension provides the same functionality as the IHAVE command ([NNTP] section 6.3.2) but splits the query and transfer functionality into the CHECK and TAKETHIS commands respectively.
This allows the CHECK and TAKETHIS commands to be pipelined ([NNTP] section 3.5) and provides for "streaming" article transfer.
A streaming client will often pipeline many CHECK commands and use the responses to construct a list of articles to be sent by a pipelined sequence of TAKETHIS commands, thus increasing the fraction of time spent transferring articles.
The CHECK and TAKETHIS commands utilize distinct response codes so that these commands can be intermingled in a pipeline and the response to any single command can be definitively identified by the client.
The client MAY send articles via TAKETHIS without first querying the server with CHECK.
The client SHOULD NOT send every article in this fashion unless explicitly configured to do so by the site administrator based on out of band information.
However, the client MAY use an adaptive strategy where it initially sends CHECK commands for all articles, but switches to using TAKETHIS without CHECK if most articles are being accepted (over 95% acceptance might be a reasonable metric in some configurations).
If the client uses such a strategy, it SHOULD also switch back to using CHECK on all articles if the acceptance rate ever falls much below the threshold.
Advertising the STREAMING Extension A server supporting the streaming commands described in this document will advertise the "STREAMING" capability label in response to the CAPABILITIES command ([NNTP] section 5.2).
The server MUST continue to advertise this capability after a client has issued the MODE STREAM command.
This capability MAY be advertised both before and after any use of the MODE READER command ([NNTP] section 5.3), with the same semantics.
Example of a client using CAPABILITIES and MODE STREAM on a mode  switching server: [C] CAPABILITIES [S] 101 Capability list:
[S] VERSION 2 [S] MODE READER [S] IHAVE
[S] LIST ACTIVE [S] STREAMING [S] .
203 Streaming permitted [C] CAPABILITIES [S] 101 Capability list:
[S] VERSION 2 [S] MODE READER [S] IHAVE
[S] LIST ACTIVE [S] STREAMING [S] .
[C] CAPABILITIES [S] 101 Capability list: [S]
[S] READER [S] POST [S] LIST ACTIVE NEWSGROUPS HEADERS [S] HDR [S] .
Command Historically this command was used by a client to discover if a server supported the CHECK and TAKETHIS commands.
This command is deprecated in favor of the CAPABILITIES discovery command and is only provided here for compatibility with legacy implementations [NNTP COMMON] of these transport commands.
New clients SHOULD use the CAPABILITIES command to check a server for support of the STREAMING extension but MAY use the MODE STREAM command for backwards compatibility with legacy servers that don't support the CAPABILITIES discovery command.
Servers MUST accept the MODE STREAM command for backwards compatibility with legacy clients that don't use the CAPABILITIES discovery command.
This command may be removed from a future version of this specification, therefore clients are urged to transition to the CAPABILITIES command wherever possible.
Usage Syntax MODE STREAM Responses 203
If a server supports this extension, it MUST return a 203 response to the MODE STREAM command (or 501 if an argument is given).
The MODE STREAM command MUST NOT affect the server state in any way (that is, it is not a mode change despite the name), therefore this command MAY be pipelined.
A server MUST NOT require that the MODE STREAM command be issued by the client before accepting the CHECK or TAKETHIS commands.
Examples Example of a client checking the ability to stream articles on a server which does not support this extension: [C] MODE STREAM [S] 501
Unknown MODE variant Example of a client checking the ability to stream articles on a server which supports this extension: [C] MODE STREAM [S]
Send article to be transferred 431 message
Transfer not possible; try again later 438 message id
Article not wanted Parameters message id
The first parameter of the 238, 431, and 438 responses MUST be the message id provided by the client as the parameter to CHECK.
The CHECK command informs the server that the client has an article with the specified message id.
If the server desires a copy of that article, a 238 response MUST be returned, indicating that the client may send the article using the TAKETHIS command.
If the server does not want the article (if, for example, the server already has a copy of it), a 438 response MUST be returned, indicating that the article is not wanted.
Finally, if the article isn't wanted immediately but the client should retry later if possible (if, for example, another client has offered to send the same article to the server), a 431 response MUST be returned.
The responses to CHECK are advisory; the server MUST NOT rely on the client to behave as requested by these responses.
Examples Example of a client checking whether the server would like a set of articles and getting a mixture of responses
Example of pipelining the CHECK commands in the previous example: [C] CHECK <i.am.an.article.you.will.want@example.com
Usage A client MUST NOT use this command unless the server advertises the STREAMING capability or returns a 203 response to the MODE STREAM command.
Article transferred OK 439 message
Transfer rejected; do not retry Parameters message id
The first parameter of the 239 and 439 responses MUST be the message id provided by the client as the parameter to TAKETHIS.
The TAKETHIS command is used to send an article with the specified message id to the server.
The article is sent immediately following the CRLF at the end of the TAKETHIS command line.
The client MUST send the entire article, including headers and body, to the server as a multi line data block ([NNTP] section 3.1.1).
The server MUST return either a 239 response, indicating that the article was successfully transferred, or a 439 response, indicating that the article was rejected.
If the server encounters a temporary error that prevents it from processing the article but does not want to reject the article, it MUST reply with a 400 response to the client and close the connection.
This function differs from the POST command in that it is intended for use in transferring already posted articles between hosts.
It SHOULD NOT be used when the client is a personal news reading program,
since use of this command indicates that the article has already been posted at another site and is simply being forwarded from another host.
However, despite this, the server MAY elect not to post or forward the article if, after further examination of the article, it deems it inappropriate to do so.
Reasons for such subsequent rejection of an article may include problems such as inappropriate newsgroups or distributions, disk space limitations, article lengths, garbled headers, and the like.
These are typically restrictions enforced by the server host's news software and not necessarily by the NNTP server itself.
The client SHOULD NOT assume that the article has been successfully transferred unless it receives an affirmative response from the server.
A lack of response (such as a dropped network connection or a network timeout) or a 400 response SHOULD be treated as a temporary failure and cause the transfer to be tried again later if possible.
Because some news server software may not immediately be able to determine whether an article is suitable for posting or forwarding, an NNTP server MAY acknowledge the successful transfer of the article (with a 239 response) but later silently discard it.
Examples Example of streaming two articles to another site (the first article is accepted and the second is rejected)

Augmented BNF Syntax for the STREAMING Extension
This section describes the formal syntax of the STREAMING extension using ABNF [ABNF].
It extends the syntax in section 9 of [NNTP], and non terminals not defined in this document are defined there.
The [NNTP] ABNF should be imported first before attempting to validate these rules.
This syntax extends the non terminal "command", which represents an NNTP command.
command  / check command / mode stream command / takethis command check command
This syntax extends the non terminal "command datastream", which represents the further material sent by the client in the case of streaming commands.
/ takethis datastream takethis datastream   encoded article 3.3.
This syntax extends the non terminal "initial response content", which represents an initial response line sent by the server.
initial response content  / response 238 content / response 239 content / response 431 content / response 438 content / response 439 content response 238 content
"238" SP message id response 239 content
"439" SP message id 3.4.
This syntax extends the non terminal "capability entry", which represents a capability that may be advertised by the server.
/ streaming capability streaming capability
This section contains a list of each new response code defined in this document and indicates whether it is multi line, which commands can generate it, what arguments it has, and what its meaning is.
Generated by: MODE STREAM Meaning:
send article to be transferred.
Response code 239 Generated by: TAKETHIS 1 argument:
Meaning: transfer not possible; try again later.
438 Generated by: CHECK 1 argument:
Generated by: TAKETHIS 1 argument:
Meaning: transfer rejected; do not retry.
No new security considerations are introduced by this extension, beyond those already described in the core specification [NNTP].
This section gives a formal definition of the STREAMING extension as required by Section 3.3.3 of [NNTP] for the IANA registry.
The STREAMING extension provides for streaming transfer of articles.
The capability label for this extension is "STREAMING".
The capability label has no arguments.
The extension defines three new commands, MODE STREAM, CHECK, and TAKETHIS, whose behavior, arguments, and responses are defined in Sections 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 respectively.
The extension does not associate any new responses with pre  existing NNTP commands.
The extension does not affect the behavior of a server or client other than via the new commands.
The extension does not affect the maximum length of commands or initial response lines.
The extension does not alter pipelining, and the MODE STREAM, CHECK, and TAKETHIS commands can be pipelined.
Use of this extension does not alter the capabilities list.
The extension does not cause any pre existing command to produce a 401, 480, or 483 response.
Use of the MODE READER command on a mode switching server may disable this extension.
