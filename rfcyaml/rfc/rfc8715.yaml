  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document captures the rationale for the changes introduced\
    \ in\n   [RFC8714].\n   At the time [RFC8714] was published, the changes to the\
    \ IETF\n   Administrative Support Activity, Version 2.0 (IASA 2.0) had an impact\n\

- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   The purpose of the IETF Trust is to acquire, hold, maintain,\
    \ and\n   license certain existing and future intellectual property and other\n\
    \   property used in connection with the administration of the IETF\n   [RFC8714].\
    \  The intellectual property is, for instance, rights that\n   the IETF contributors\
    \ grant for text in RFCs and Internet-Drafts.\n   The IETF Trust also manages\
    \ trademarks such as \"IETF\" and domain\n   names such as \"ietf.org\".  The\
    \ IETF Trust is also serving the broader\n   Internet community by holding domains\
    \ and trademarks associated with\n   the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)\
    \ [RFC7979].\n   The IETF Trust is a legal entity, registered in the Commonwealth\
    \ of\n   Virginia [Trust-FD].\n   Previously, the members of the IAOC also served\
    \ as ex officio\n   Trustees of the IETF Trust.  The founding documents specify\
    \ persons\n   eligible to become Trustees as having to be then-current members\
    \ of\n   the IAOC [Trust-FD].  The documents also specify that if for any\n  \
    \ reason there are fewer than three individuals serving as Trustees,\n   then\
    \ the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), or the IESG's\n   successor\
    \ as the leadership of the IETF, shall appoint one or more\n   individuals to\
    \ serve in a temporary capacity as Trustee(s) until\n   eligible persons can be\
    \ found.\n   In the previous system, there were eight voting members of the IAOC.\n\
    \   Two were named by the IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom), one by the\n   Internet\
    \ Engineering Steering Group (IESG), one by the Internet\n   Architecture Board\
    \ (IAB), and one by the Internet Society (ISOC)\n   Board of Trustees.  There\
    \ were three ex officio members via their\n   roles as IETF Chair, ISOC CEO, and\
    \ IAB Chair.  In addition, the IETF\n   Administrative Director (IAD) was a non-voting\
    \ IAOC member who also\n   served as one of the Trustees.\n"
- title: 3.  General Approach
  contents:
  - "3.  General Approach\n   There were two basic approaches to resolving the issue\
    \ with the\n   Trustees once the IAOC ceased to exist.  One approach would be\
    \ to\n   merge all IETF Trust functions in the new IASA structure and under\n\
    \   the new legal entity.  However, this memo advocates a second approach\n  \
    \ where the IETF Trust is kept independent.\n   The rationale for advocating the\
    \ second approach is, in part, to\n   minimize changes to the IETF Trust while\
    \ the IETF's administrative\n   structure is undergoing major change.  In addition,\
    \ the IETF Trust\n   and other administrative IETF processes are quite different.\
    \  While\n   very important, the IETF Trust is a low-activity entity where changes\n\
    \   are minimal and gradual, and there are no pressing issues.\n"
- title: 4.  Changing the Way Trustees Are Selected
  contents:
  - "4.  Changing the Way Trustees Are Selected\n   When the Trustees were serving\
    \ on both the IETF Trust and the IAOC,\n   many of the requirements for naming\
    \ a particular group of people were\n   driven by the IAOC's requirements.  For\
    \ the IETF Trust in the new\n   model, some of those arrangements were rethought,\
    \ both in terms of\n   the number and source of the Trustees, as well as the desired\n\
    \   qualifications and length of terms.\n   Several options were possible, of\
    \ course.  A newly designed selection\n   process could have been devised, but\
    \ in this document we argue for\n   limited change based largely on the fact that\
    \ a) the IETF Trust\n   arrangements worked generally well, b) the expected time\
    \ commitment\n   is expected to be modest, and c) the assets need very careful\n\
    \   management.\n   As a result, a smaller group of Trustees appeared sufficient.\n\
    \   In addition, the terms set for the Trustees selected from the IETF\n   community\
    \ could be longer than the two-year period typical of other\n   IETF bodies.\n\
    \   One could have continued the practice of having the chairs and CEOs\n   from\
    \ the IETF, IAB, and Internet Society be Trustees as well, but\n   this may not\
    \ be necessary.  In general, the tasks of the IETF Trust\n   are well defined,\
    \ and while there is a need for coordination, it does\n   not need to be at the\
    \ level of chairs or CEOs.\n   Given all this, one approach was to have Trustees\
    \ appointed by the\n   NomCom, the IESG, and the ISOC Board of Trustees.  (One\
    \ might also\n   have considered the IETF Administration LLC legal entity instead\
    \ of\n   the Internet Society for this role, but the Internet Society is\n   perhaps\
    \ more suitable for the role given their focus on the broad use\n   of the IETF\
    \ Trust assets and not merely administrative aspects.)\n   If the same principles\
    \ used for previous appointments continued to be\n   used, then appointments performed\
    \ by the NomCom would need to be\n   confirmed by another entity.  This could\
    \ be, for instance, either the\n   IESG or the IAB.  The IESG had previously been\
    \ the confirming body\n   for the IAOC, so it has been retained in that role for\
    \ the Trustees.\n"
- title: 5.  Transition
  contents:
  - "5.  Transition\n   When the new entity for the IETF Administration LLC was set\
    \ up, the\n   IAOC was expected to be discontinued soon thereafter.  Fortunately,\n\
    \   there was no pressing need to change all the components of the IAOC\n   and\
    \ its dependent organizations at the same time.  As discussed in\n   Section 2,\
    \ the IESG holds the ability to continue to name Trustees.\n   Once the updated\
    \ procedures were in place, the IETF Trust had its\n   management nominated in\
    \ the usual manner, and the IESG's exception\n   process was no longer needed.\n"
