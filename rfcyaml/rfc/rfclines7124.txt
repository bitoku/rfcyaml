Abstract This document updates RFC 5066.
It amends that specification by informing the Internet community about the transition of the EFM CU MIB module from the concluded IETF Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB Working Group to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
[RFC5066] defines two MIB modules:
EFM CU MIB, with a set of objects for managing 10PASS TS and 2BASE TL Ethernet in the First Mile Copper (EFMCu) interfaces; IF CAP STACK MIB, with a set of objects describing cross connect capability of a managed device with multi layer (stacked) interfaces, extending the stack management objects in the Interfaces Group MIB and the Inverted Stack Table MIB modules.
With the conclusion of the [HUBMIB] working group, the responsibility for the maintenance and further development of a MIB module for managing 2BASE TL and 10PASS TS interfaces has been transferred to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
In 2011, the IEEE developed the IEEE8023
EFM CU MIB module, based on the original EFM CU MIB module [RFC5066].
The current revision of IEEE8023 EFM CU MIB is defined in IEEE Std 802.3.1 2013
The IEEE8023 EFM CU MIB and EFM
CU MIB MIB modules can coexist.
Existing deployments of the EFM
CU MIB need not be upgraded, but operators using the MIB should expect that new equipment will use the IEEE8023 EFM CU MIB.
Please note that the IF CAP STACK MIB module was not transferred to IEEE and remains as defined in RFC 5066.
This memo provides an updated security considerations section for that module, since the original RFC did not list any security considerations for IF CAP STACK MIB. 2.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
Mapping between EFM CU MIB and IEEE8023
The current version of IEEE8023 EFM CU MIB, defined in IEEE Std 802.3.1 2013, has MODULE IDENTITY of ieee8023efmCuMIB with an object identifier allocated under the { iso(1) iso identified organization(3)
ieee802dot3(3) ieee802dot3dot1mibs(1) } sub tree.
The EFM CU MIB has MODULE IDENTITY of efmCuMIB with an object identifier allocated under the mib 2 sub tree.
The names of the objects in the first version of the IEEE8023 EFM CU MIB are identical to those in the EFM CU MIB.
However, since both MIB modules have different OID values, they can coexist, allowing the management of the newer IEEE MIB based devices alongside the legacy IETF MIB based devices.
Updating the MIB Modules With the transfer of the responsibility for maintenance and further development of the EFM
CU MIB module to the IEEE 802.3 working group,
the EFM CU MIB defined in RFC 5066 becomes the last version of that MIB module.
All further development of the EFM Copper Interfaces MIB will be done by the IEEE 802.3 working group in the IEEE8023 EFM CU MIB module.
Requests and comments pertaining to EFM Copper Interfaces MIB should be sent to the IEEE 802.3.1 task force, currently chartered with MIB development, via its mailing list [LIST802.3.1].
The IF CAP STACK MIB remains under IETF control and is currently maintained by the [OPSAWG] working group.
There are no managed objects defined in the IF CAP STACK MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
So, if this MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct SNMP SET operations.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
In particular, ifCapStackStatus and ifInvCapStackStatus can identify cross connect capability of multi layer (stacked) network interfaces, potentially revealing the underlying hardware architecture of the managed device.
It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
