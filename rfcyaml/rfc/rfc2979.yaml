  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines behavioral characteristics of and interoperability\n\
    \   requirements for Internet firewalls.  While most of these things may\n   seem\
    \ obvious, current firewall behavior is often either unspecified\n   or underspecified\
    \ and this lack of specificity often causes problems\n   in practice.  This requirement\
    \ is intended to be a necessary first\n   step in making the behavior of firewalls\
    \ more consistent across\n   implementations and in line with accepted IP protocol\
    \ practices.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Internet is being used for an increasing number of mission\n\
    \   critical applications.  Because of this many sites find isolated\n   secure\
    \ intranets insufficient for their needs, even when those\n   intranets are based\
    \ on and use Internet protocols.  Instead they find\n   it necessary to provide\
    \ direct communications paths between the\n   sometimes hostile Internet and systems\
    \ or networks which either deal\n   with valuable data, provide vital services,\
    \ or both.\n   The security concerns that inevitably arise from such setups are\n\
    \   often dealt with by inserting one or more \"firewalls\" on the path\n   between\
    \ the Internet and the internal network.  A \"firewall\" is an\n   agent which\
    \ screens network traffic in some way, blocking traffic it\n   believes to be\
    \ inappropriate, dangerous, or both.\n   Note that firewall functions are disjoint\
    \ from network address\n   translation (NAT) functions -- neither implies the\
    \ other, although\n   sometimes both are provided by the same device.  This document\
    \ only\n   discusses firewall functions.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements notation
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements notation\n   This document occasionally uses terms that appear\
    \ in capital letters.\n   When the terms \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   appear capitalized, they are being used to indicate\
    \ particular\n   requirements of this specification.  A discussion of the meanings\
    \ of\n   these terms appears in RFC 2119 [2].\n"
- title: 2.  Characteristics
  contents:
  - "2.  Characteristics\n   Firewalls either act as a protocol end point and relay\
    \ (e.g., a SMTP\n   client/server or a Web proxy agent), as a packet filter, or\
    \ some\n   combination of both.\n   When a firewall acts a protocol end point\
    \ it may\n    (1)   implement a \"safe\" subset of the protocol,\n    (2)   perform\
    \ extensive protocol validity checks,\n    (3)   use an implementation methodology\
    \ designed to minimize\n          the likelihood of bugs,\n    (4)   run in an\
    \ insulated, \"safe\" environment, or\n    (5)   use some combination of these\
    \ techniques in tandem.\n   Firewalls acting as packet filters aren't visible\
    \ as protocol end\n   points.  The firewall examines each packet and then\n  \
    \  (1)   passes the packet through to the other side unchanged,\n    (2)   drops\
    \ the packet entirely, or\n    (3)   handles the packet itself in some way.\n\
    \   Firewalls typically base some of their decisions on IP source and\n   destination\
    \ addresses and port numbers.  For example, firewalls may\n   (1)   block packets\
    \ from the Internet side that claim a source\n         address of a system on\
    \ the internal network,\n   (2)   block TELNET or RLOGIN connections from the\
    \ Internet to the\n         internal network,\n   (3)   block SMTP and FTP connections\
    \ to the Internet from internal\n         systems not authorized to send email\
    \ or move files,\n   (4)   act as an intermediate server in handling SMTP and\
    \ HTTP\n         connections in either direction, or\n   (5)   require the use\
    \ of an access negotiation and encapsulation\n         protocol such as SOCKS\
    \ [1] to gain access to the Internet, to\n         the internal network, or both.\n\
    \   (This list of decision criteria is only intended to illustrate the\n   sorts\
    \ of factors firewalls often consider; it is by no means\n   exhaustive, nor are\
    \ all firewall products able to perform all the\n   operations on this list.)\n"
- title: 3.  Firewall Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Firewall Requirements\n   Applications have to continue to work properly\
    \ in the presence of\n   firewalls.  This translates into the following transparency\
    \ rule:\n      The introduction of a firewall and any associated tunneling or\n\
    \      access negotiation facilities MUST NOT cause unintended failures\n    \
    \  of legitimate and standards-compliant usage that would work were\n      the\
    \ firewall not present.\n   A necessary corollary to this requirement is that\
    \ when such failures\n   do occur it is incumbent on the firewall and associated\
    \ software to\n   address the problem: Changes to either implementations of existing\n\
    \   standard protocols or the protocols themselves MUST NOT be necessary.\n  \
    \ Note that this requirement only applies to legitimate protocol usage\n   and\
    \ gratuitous failures -- a firewall is entitled to block any sort\n   of access\
    \ that a site deems illegitimate, regardless of whether or\n   not the attempted\
    \ access is standards-compliant.  This is, after all,\n   the primary reason to\
    \ have a firewall in the first place.\n   Also note that it is perfectly permissible\
    \ for a firewall to provide\n   additional facilities applications can use to\
    \ authenticate or\n   authorize various sorts of connections, and for the firewall\
    \ to be\n   configurable to require the use of such facilities.  The SOCKS\n \
    \  protocol [1] is one example of such a facility.  However, the\n   firewall\
    \ MUST also allow configurations where such facilities are not\n   required for\
    \ traversal.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Examples
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Examples\n   The following sections provide some examples of how the transparency\n\
    \   rule actually applies to some specific protocols.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Path MTU Discovery and ICMP
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Path MTU Discovery and ICMP\n   ICMP messages are commonly blocked at\
    \ firewalls because of a\n   perception that they are a source of security vulnerabilities.\
    \  This\n   often creates \"black holes\" for Path MTU Discovery [3], causing\n\
    \   legitimate application traffic to be delayed or completely blocked\n   when\
    \ talking to systems connected via links with small MTUs.\n   By the transparency\
    \ rule, a packet-filtering router acting as a\n   firewall which permits outgoing\
    \ IP packets with the Don't Fragment\n   (DF) bit set MUST NOT block incoming\
    \ ICMP Destination Unreachable /\n   Fragmentation Needed errors sent in response\
    \ to the outbound packets\n   from reaching hosts inside the firewall, as this\
    \ would break the\n   standards-compliant usage of Path MTU discovery by hosts\
    \ generating\n   legitimate traffic.\n   On the other hand, it's proper (albeit\
    \ unfriendly) to block ICMP Echo\n   and Echo Reply messages, since these form\
    \ a different use of the\n   network, or to block ICMP Redirect messages entirely,\
    \ or to block\n   ICMP DU/FN messages which were not sent in response to legitimate\n\
    \   outbound traffic.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  SMTP Extensions
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  SMTP Extensions\n   The original SMTP protocol [4] didn't provide a mechanism\
    \ for\n   negotiating protocol extensions.  When this was added [5], some\n  \
    \ firewall implementations reacted by simply adding the EHLO command to\n   the\
    \ list of accepted commands.  Unfortunately, this is not\n   sufficient: What\
    \ is necessary is for the firewall to scan the list of\n   EHLO responses and\
    \ only allow the ones the firewalls understands\n   through.  If this isn't done\
    \ the client and server can end up\n   agreeing to use an extension the firewalls\
    \ doesn't understand, which\n   can then lead to unnecessary protocol failures.\n"
- title: 4.  Application Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Application Requirements\n   Firewalls are a fact of life that application\
    \ protocols must face.\n   As such, application protocols SHOULD be designed to\
    \ facilitate\n   operation across firewalls, as long as such design choices don't\n\
    \   adversely impact the application in other ways.  In addition,\n   application\
    \ protocol specifications MAY include material defining\n   requirements firewalls\
    \ must meet to properly handle a given\n   application protocol.\n   Examples\
    \ of proper and improper application protocol design include:\n   (1)   Wrapping\
    \ a new protocol around HTTP and using port 80 because\n         it is likely\
    \ to be open isn't a good idea, since it will\n         eventually result in added\
    \ complexity in firewall handling of\n         port 80.\n   (2)   Defining a secure\
    \ subset of a protocol is a good idea since it\n         simplifies the firewall\
    \ design process.\n   (3)   Specificating an appropriate firewall traversal mechanism\
    \ if\n         one exists is a good idea.\n   (4)   Registering a separate port\
    \ for new protocols is a good idea.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Good security may occasionally result in interoperability\
    \ failures\n   between components.  This is understood.  However, this doesn't\
    \ mean\n   that gratuitous interoperability failures caused by security\n   components\
    \ are acceptable.\n   The transparency rule impacts security to the extent that\
    \ it\n   precludes certain simpleminded firewall implementation techniques.\n\
    \   Firewall implementors must therefore work a little harder to achieve\n   a\
    \ given level of security.  However, the transparency rule in no way\n   prevents\
    \ an implementor from achieving whatever level of security is\n   necessary. \
    \ Moreover, a little more work up front results in better\n   security in the\
    \ long run.  Techniques that do not interfere with\n   existing services will\
    \ almost certainly be more widely deployed than\n   ones that do interfere and\
    \ prevent people from performing useful\n   work.\n   Some firewall implementors\
    \ may claim that the burden of total\n   transparency is overly onerous and that\
    \ adequate security cannot be\n   achieved in the face of such a requirement.\
    \  And there is no question\n   that meeting the transparency requirement is more\
    \ difficult than not\n   doing so.\n   Nevertheless, it is important to remember\
    \ that the only perfectly\n   secure network is one that doesn't allow any data\
    \ through at all and\n   that the only problem with such a network is that it\
    \ is unusable.\n   Anything less is necessarily a tradeoff between usability and\n\
    \   security.  At present firewalls are being circumvented in ad hoc ways\n  \
    \ because they don't meet this transparency requirement and this\n   necessarily\
    \ weakens security dramatically.  In other words, the only\n   reason that some\
    \ firewalls remain in use is because they have\n   essentially been disabled.\
    \  As such, one reason to have a\n   transparency requirement is to IMPROVE security.\n"
