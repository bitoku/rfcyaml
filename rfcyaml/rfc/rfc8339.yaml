  - "1.  Introduction\n   A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) emulates the
    essential\n   attributes of a unidirectional P2MP Telecommunications service such\n
    \  as P2MP ATM over a Public Switched Network (PSN).  Requirements for\n   P2MP
    PWs are described in [RFC7338].  P2MP PWs are carried over a\n   P2MP MPLS LSP.
    \ The procedures for P2MP PW signaling using BGP are\n   described in [RFC7117];
    LDP for single segment P2MP PWs is described\n   in [RFC8338].  Many P2MP PWs
    can share the same P2MP MPLS LSP; this\n   arrangement is called an \"Aggregate
    P2MP Tree\".  An Aggregate P2MP\n   Tree requires an upstream-assigned label so
    that on the Leaf PE\n   (L-PE), the traffic can be associated with a Virtual Private
    Network\n   (VPN) or a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) instance.  When a P2MP\n
    \  MPLS LSP carries only one VPN or VPLS service instance, the\n   arrangement
    is called an \"Inclusive P2MP Tree\".  For an Inclusive\n   P2MP Tree, the P2MP
    MPLS LSP label itself can uniquely identify the\n   VPN or VPLS service being
    carried over the P2MP MPLS LSP.  The P2MP\n   MPLS LSP can also be used in the
    Selective P2MP Tree arrangement to\n   carry multicast traffic.  In a Selective
    P2MP Tree arrangement,\n   traffic to each multicast group in a VPN or VPLS instance
    is carried\n   by a separate unique P2MP LSP.  In an Aggregate Selective P2MP
    Tree\n   arrangement, traffic to a set of multicast groups from different VPN\n
    \  or VPLS instances is carried over the same shared P2MP LSP.\n   The P2MP MPLS
    LSPs are setup using either P2MP RSVP-TE [RFC4875] or\n   Multipoint LDP (mDLP)
    [RFC6388].  Mechanisms for fault detection and\n   isolation for data-plane failures
    for P2MP MPLS LSPs are specified in\n   [RFC6425].  This document describes a
    mechanism to detect data-plane\n   failures for P2MP PW carried over P2MP MPLS
    LSPs.\n   This document defines a new P2MP Pseudowire sub-TLV for the Target\n
    \  Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) Stack for P2MP PWs.  The P2MP\n   Pseudowire
    sub-TLV is added in the Target FEC Stack TLV by the\n   originator of the echo
    request at the Root PE (R-PE) to inform the\n   receiver at the Leaf PE (L-PE)
    of the P2MP PW being tested.\n   Support for multi-segment PWs is out of scope
    of this document.\n"

    2: P2MP PW\n   When an operator wants to perform a connectivity check for the
    P2MP\n   PW1, the operator initiates an LSP Ping echo request from Root PE\n   R-PE1,
    with the Target FEC Stack TLV containing the P2MP Pseudowire\n   sub-TLV in the
    echo request packet.  For an Inclusive P2MP Tree\n   arrangement, the echo request
    packet is sent over the P2MP MPLS LSP\n   with one of the following two encapsulation
    options:\n   o  {P2MP LSP label, GAL} MPLS label stack and IPv4 or IPv6 ACH.\n
    \  o  {P2MP LSP label} MPLS label stack and PW ACH.\n   For an Aggregate Inclusive
    Tree arrangement, the echo request packet\n   is sent over the P2MP MPLS LSP with
    one of the following two\n   encapsulation options:\n   o  {P2MP LSP label, P2MP

    PW ACH.\n   The intermediate P routers do MPLS label swap and replication based\n
    \  on the incoming MPLS LSP label.  Once the echo request packet reaches\n   L-PEs,
    L-PEs use the GAL and the IPv4/IPv6 ACH Channel header or PW\n   ACH as the case
    may be, to determine that the packet is an OAM\n   Packet.  The L-PEs process
    the packet and perform checks for the P2MP\n   Pseudowire sub-TLV present in the
