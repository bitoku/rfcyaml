This document contains the body parts defined in RFC 1495 for carrying image formats that were originally defined in MIME through an X.400 system.
It also documents the OIDs assigned to these data formats as FTAM body parts, which allow the MIME types to be converted to FTAM body parts; this will probably be more useful than the new body parts defined here.
Newly defined X.400 body parts 2.1.
The following Extended Body Part is defined for JPEG data streams.
EXTENDED BODY PART TYPE DATA

} while EMA's OID is { joint iso ccitt(2)
ema(113694) } making the total OID, numeric only { 2 16 840 1 113694 2 2 1 6 } 3.3.
