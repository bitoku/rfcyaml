    \  Engineering (RSVP-TE) [RFC2205] [RFC3209] signaling extensions for\n   reoptimizing
    loosely routed Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Traffic\n   Engineering (TE) Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs) [RFC4875] in a\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) or Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS)\n   [RFC3473] network.\n   A P2MP-TE LSP is comprised of one or more
    source-to-leaf (S2L)\n   sub-LSPs.  A loosely routed P2MP-TE S2L sub-LSP is defined
    as one\n   whose path does not contain the full explicit route identifying each\n
    \  node along the path to the egress node at the time of its signaling\n   by
    the ingress node.  Such an S2L sub-LSP is signaled with no\n   Explicit Route
    Object (ERO) [RFC3209], with an ERO that contains at\n   least one \"loose next
    hop\", or with an ERO that contains an abstract\n   node that identifies more
    than one node.  This is often the case with\n   inter-domain P2MP-TE LSPs where
    a Path Computation Element (PCE) is\n   not used [RFC5440].\n   As per [RFC4875],
    an ingress node may reoptimize the entire P2MP-TE\n   LSP tree by re-signaling
    all its S2L sub-LSPs using the\n   Make-Before-Break (MBB) method, or it may reoptimize
    an individual\n   S2L sub-LSP or a set of S2L sub-LSPs, i.e., an individual destination\n
    \  or a set of destinations, both using the Sub-Group-based\n   reoptimization
    method.\n   [RFC4736] defines an RSVP signaling procedure for reoptimizing the\n
    \  path(s) of loosely routed Point-to-Point (P2P) TE LSP(s).  The\n   mechanisms
    listed in [RFC4736] include a method for the ingress node\n   to trigger a new
    path re-evaluation request and a method for the\n   midpoint node to send a notification
    regarding the availability of a\n   preferred path.  This document discusses the
    application of those\n   mechanisms to the reoptimization of loosely routed P2MP-TE
    LSPs,\n   identifies issues in doing so, and defines procedures to address\n   them.\n
    \  For reoptimizing a group of S2L sub-LSPs in a tree using the\n   Sub-Group-based
    reoptimization method, an S2L sub-LSP descriptor list\n   can be used to signal
    one or more S2L sub-LSPs in an RSVP message.\n   This RSVP message may need to
    be semantically fragmented when a large\n   number of S2L sub-LSPs are added to
    the descriptor list.  This\n   document defines the notion of a fragment identifier
    to help\n   recipient nodes unambiguously reconstruct the fragmented S2L sub-LSP\n
    \  descriptor list.\n"

    - "3.2.  Existing Mechanism for Tree-Based P2MP-TE LSP Reoptimization\n   The
      mechanisms defined in [RFC4736] can be easily applied to trigger\n   the reoptimization
      of an individual S2L sub-LSP or a group of S2L\n   sub-LSPs.  However, to apply
      those mechanisms for triggering the\n   reoptimization of a P2MP-TE LSP tree,
      an ingress node needs to send\n   path re-evaluation requests on all (typically
      hundreds) of the\n   S2L sub-LSPs, and the midpoint LSR needs to send PathErrs
      with the\n   Notify error code for all S2L sub-LSPs.  Such mechanisms may lead
      to\n   the following issues:\n   o  A midpoint LSR that expands loose next hop(s)
      may have to\n      accumulate the received path re-evaluation request(s) for
      all S2L\n      sub-LSPs (e.g., by using a wait timer) and interpret them as
      a\n      reoptimization request for the whole P2MP-TE LSP tree.  Otherwise,\n
      \     a midpoint LSR may prematurely send a \"Preferable Path Exists\"\n      notification
      for one S2L sub-LSP or a subset of S2L sub-LSPs.\n   o  Similarly, the ingress
      node may have to heuristically determine\n      when to perform P2MP-TE LSP
      tree reoptimization and when to\n      perform S2L sub-LSP reoptimization.  For
      example, an\n      implementation may choose to delay reoptimization long enough
      to\n      allow all PathErrs to be received.  Such timer-based procedures\n
      \     may produce undesired results.\n   o  The ingress node that receives (un)solicited
      PathErr(s) with the\n      Notify error code for one or more individual S2L
      sub-LSPs may\n      prematurely start reoptimizing the subset of S2L sub-LSPs.\n
      \     However, as mentioned in [RFC4875], Section 14.2, such a\n      Sub-Group-based
      reoptimization procedure may result in data\n      duplication that can be avoided
      if the entire P2MP-TE LSP tree is\n      reoptimized using the MBB method with
      a different LSP-ID,\n      especially if the ingress node eventually receives
      PathErrs with\n      the Notify error code for all S2L sub-LSPs of the P2MP-TE\n
      \     LSP tree.\n   In order to address the above-mentioned issues and to align
      the\n   reoptimization of P2MP-TE LSPs with P2P LSPs [RFC4736], a mechanism\n
      \  is needed to trigger the reoptimization of the LSP tree by\n   re-signaling
      all S2L sub-LSPs with a different LSP-ID.  To meet this\n   requirement, this
      document defines RSVP-TE signaling extensions for\n   the ingress node to trigger
      the re-evaluation of the P2MP LSP tree on\n   every hop that has a next hop
      defined as a loose or abstract hop for\n   one or more S2L sub-LSP paths, and
      a midpoint LSR to signal to the\n   ingress node that a preferable LSP tree
      exists (compared to the\n   current path) or that the whole P2MP-TE LSP must
      be reoptimized\n   (because of maintenance required on the TE LSP path) (see\n
      \  Section 4.1).\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Existing Mechanism for Sub-Group-Based P2MP-TE LSP Reoptimization\n   Applying
      the procedures discussed in [RFC4736] in conjunction with\n   the Sub-Group-based
      reoptimization procedures ([RFC4875],\n   Section 14.2), an ingress node MAY
      trigger path re-evaluation\n   requests for a set of S2L sub-LSPs in a single
      Path message using an\n   S2L sub-LSP descriptor list.  Similarly, a midpoint
      LSR may send a\n   PathErr with Notify error code 25 and sub-code 6 (\"Preferable
      Path\n   Exists\") containing a list of S2L sub-LSPs transiting through the
      LSR\n   using an S2L sub-LSP descriptor list to notify the ingress node.\n   This
      method can be used for reoptimizing a sub-group of S2L sub-LSPs\n   within an
      LSP tree using the same LSP-ID.  This method can alleviate\n   the scaling issue
      associated with sending RSVP messages for\n   individual S2L sub-LSPs.  However,
      this procedure can lead to the\n   following issues when used to reoptimize
      the LSP tree:\n   o  A Path message that is intended to carry the path re-evaluation\n
      \     request as defined in [RFC4736] with a full list of S2L sub-LSPs\n      in
      an S2L sub-LSP descriptor list will be decomposed at branching\n      LSRs,
      and only a subset of the S2L sub-LSPs that are routed over\n      the same next
      hop will be added in the descriptor list of the Path\n      message propagated
      to downstream midpoint LSRs.  Consequently,\n      when a preferable path exists
      at such midpoint LSRs, the PathErr\n      with the Notify error code can only
      include the subset of S2L\n      sub-LSPs traversing the LSR.  In this case,
      at the ingress node\n      there is no way to distinguish which mode of reoptimization
      to\n      invoke, i.e., Sub-Group-based reoptimization using the same LSP-ID\n
      \     or tree-based reoptimization using a different LSP-ID.\n   o  An LSR may
      semantically fragment a large RSVP message (when a\n      combined message may
      not be large enough to fit all S2L sub-LSPs).\n      In this case, the ingress
      node may receive multiple PathErrs with\n      subsets of S2L sub-LSPs in each
      (due to either the combined Path\n      message getting fragmented or the combined
      PathErr message getting\n      fragmented) and would require additional logic
      to determine how to\n      reoptimize the LSP tree (for example, waiting for
      some time to\n      aggregate all possible PathErr messages before taking an
      action).\n      When fragmented, RSVP messages may arrive out of order, and
      the\n      receiver has no way of knowing the beginning and end of the S2L\n
      \     sub-LSP list.\n   In order to address the above-mentioned issues caused
      by semantic\n   fragmentation of an RSVP message, this document defines a new\n
      \  fragment identifier object for the S2L sub-LSP descriptor list when\n   combining
      a large number of S2L sub-LSPs in an RSVP message (see\n   Section 4.2).\n"

    - "4.1.  Tree-Based Reoptimization\n   To evaluate a P2MP-TE LSP tree on midpoint
      LSRs that expand loose\n   next hop(s), an ingress node MAY send a Path message
      with the\n   \"P2MP-TE Tree Re-evaluation Request\" flag set (bit number 14
      in the\n   Attribute Flags TLV) as defined in this document.  The ingress node\n
      \  selects one of the S2L sub-LSPs of the P2MP-TE LSP tree transiting a\n   midpoint
      LSR to trigger the re-evaluation request.  The ingress node\n   MAY send a re-evaluation
      request to each border LSR on the path of\n   the LSP tree.\n   A midpoint LSR
      that expands loose next hop(s) for one or more S2L\n   sub-LSP paths does the
      following upon receiving a Path message with\n   the \"P2MP-TE Tree Re-evaluation
      Request\" flag set:\n   o  The midpoint LSR MUST check for a preferable P2MP-TE
      LSP tree by\n      re-evaluating all S2L sub-LSPs that are expanded paths of
      the\n      loose next hops of the P2MP-TE LSP.\n   o  If a preferable P2MP-TE
      LSP tree is found, the midpoint LSR MUST\n      send to the ingress node an
      RSVP PathErr with Notify error code 25\n      [RFC3209] and sub-code 13 (\"Preferable
      P2MP-TE Tree Exists)\" as\n      defined in this document.  The midpoint LSR,
      in turn, SHOULD NOT\n      propagate the \"P2MP-TE Tree Re-evaluation Request\"
      flag in the\n      subsequent RSVP Path messages sent downstream for the re-evaluated\n
      \     P2MP-TE LSP.\n   o  If no preferable tree for P2MP-TE LSPs can be found,
      the midpoint\n      LSR that expands loose next hop(s) for one or more S2L sub-LSP\n
      \     paths MUST propagate the request downstream by setting the\n      \"P2MP-TE
      Tree Re-evaluation Request\" flag in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES\n      object of the
      RSVP Path message.\n   A midpoint LSR MAY send an unsolicited PathErr with the
      Notify error\n   code and the \"Preferable P2MP-TE Tree Exists\" sub-code to
      the ingress\n   node to notify the ingress node of a preferred P2MP-TE LSP tree
      when\n   it determines that it exists.  In this case, the midpoint LSR that\n
      \  expands loose next hop(s) for one or more S2L sub-LSP paths selects\n   one
      of the S2L sub-LSPs of the P2MP-TE LSP tree to send this PathErr\n   message
      to the ingress node.  The midpoint LSR SHOULD consider how\n   frequently it
      chooses to send such a PathErr, considering that both\n   (1) a PathErr may
      be lost during its transit to the ingress node and\n   (2) the ingress node
      may choose not to reoptimize the LSP when such a\n   PathErr is received.\n
      \  The sending of an RSVP PathErr with the Notify error code and the\n   \"Preferable
      P2MP-TE Tree Exists\" sub-code to the ingress node\n   notifies the ingress
      node of the existence of a preferable P2MP-TE\n   LSP tree, and upon receiving
      this PathErr, the ingress node SHOULD\n   trigger the reoptimization of the
      LSP, using the MBB method with a\n   different LSP-ID.\n"

      requests using the\n   procedures defined in [RFC4736] for a set of S2L sub-LSPs
      by\n   combining multiple Path messages using an S2L sub-LSP descriptor list\n
      \  [RFC4875].  An S2L sub-LSP descriptor list is created using a series\n   of
      S2L_SUB_LSP objects as defined in [RFC4875].  Similarly, a\n   midpoint LSR
      may send a PathErr with Notify error code 25 and\n   sub-code 6 (\"Preferable
      Path Exists\") containing a list of S2L\n   sub-LSPs transiting through the
      LSR using an S2L sub-LSP descriptor\n   list to notify the ingress node of preferable
      paths available.\n   The S2L_SUB_LSP_FRAG object defined in this document is
      optional,\n   with the following exceptions:\n   o  As per [RFC4875], Section
      5.2.3 (\"Transit Fragmentation of Path\n      State Information\"), when a Path
      message is not large enough to\n      fit all S2L sub-LSPs in the descriptor
      list, an LSR may\n      semantically fragment the message.  In this case, the
      LSR MUST add\n      the S2L_SUB_LSP_FRAG object defined in this document for
      each\n      fragment in the S2L sub-LSP descriptor to be able to rebuild the\n
      \     list from the received fragments that may arrive out of order.\n   o  In
      any other situation where an RSVP message needs to be\n      fragmented, an
      LSR MUST add the S2L_SUB_LSP_FRAG object for each\n      fragment in the S2L
      sub-LSP descriptor.\n   A midpoint LSR SHOULD wait to accumulate all S2L sub-LSPs
      before\n   attempting to re-evaluate a preferable path when a Path message for\n
      \  \"Path Re-evaluation Request\" is received with the S2L_SUB_LSP_FRAG\n   object.
      \ If a midpoint LSR does not receive all fragments of the Path\n   message (for
      example, when fragments are lost) within a configurable\n   time interval, it
      SHOULD trigger the re-evaluation of all S2L\n   sub-LSPs of the P2MP-TE LSP
      transiting on the node.  A midpoint LSR\n   MUST receive at least one fragment
      of the Path message to trigger\n   this behavior.\n   An ingress node SHOULD
      wait to accumulate all S2L sub-LSPs before\n   attempting to trigger reoptimization
      when a PathErr with the Notify\n   error code and the \"Preferable Path Exists\"
      sub-code is received with\n   an S2L_SUB_LSP_FRAG object.  If an ingress node
      does not receive all\n   fragments of the PathErr message (for example, when
      fragments are\n   lost) within a configurable time interval, it SHOULD trigger
      the\n   reoptimization of all S2L sub-LSPs of the P2MP-TE LSP transiting on\n
      \  the midpoint node that had sent the PathErr message.  An ingress node\n   MUST
      receive at least one fragment of the PathErr message to trigger\n   this behavior.\n
      \  The S2L_SUB_LSP_FRAG object defined in this document has a wider\n   applicability
      in addition to the P2MP-TE LSP reoptimization.  It can\n   also be used (in
      Path and Resv messages) to set up a new P2MP-TE LSP\n   and to send other PathErr
      messages as well as Path Tear and Resv Tear\n   messages for a set of S2L sub-LSPs.
      \ This is outside the scope of\n   this document.\n"

    the LSP\n   tree downstream of a node and to allow a midpoint LSR to notify the\n

    message.  As per [RFC4736], in the case of a P2MP-TE LSP S2L\n   sub-LSP spanning
