  contents:
  - "a.  DATA\n    A line of data is  composed  of  a  series  of  variable\n    length\
    \  code  words.   Each  code  word represents a run\n    length of either all\
    \ white or all black.  White runs and\n    black  runs alternate.  A total of\
    \ 1728 picture elements\n    represent one horizontal scanning line of  the  document\n\
    \    of  standard  A4  size.   In  order  to  insure that the\n    receiver maintains\
    \ color synchronization, all DATA lines\n    will  begin  with  a white run length\
    \ code word.  If the\n    (1728  picture elements or pels) are defined by the\
    \ code\n    words in Tables 1 and 2.  The  code  words  are  of  two\n    types:\
    \  Terminating  Code  words and Make Up Code words.\n    Each run length is represented\
    \ by either one Terminating\n    Code  word  or  one  Make  Up  Code  word  followed\
    \ by a\n    Terminating Code word.\n    Run lengths in the range of 0 to  63 \
    \ pels  are  encoded\n    with their appropriate Terminating Code word.  Note\
    \ that\n    there is a different list of code words  for  black  and\n    white\
    \ run lengths.\n    Run lengths in the range of 64 to 1728 pels are  encoded\n\
    \    first  by  the  Make  Up  Code word representing the run\n    length which\
    \ is equal to or shorter than that  required.\n    This  is  then  followed  by\
    \  the  Terminating Code word\n    representing the difference  between  the \
    \ required  run\n    length  and  the  run  length represented by the Make Up\n\
    \    Code.\n"

    \  is  a\n    unique  code word that can never be found within a valid\n    line\
    \ of  DATA;  therefore,  resynchronization  after  an\n    error burst is possible.\n\

    \  FILL.  FILL may be inserted between a line\n    of DATA and an EOL, but never\
    \ within  a  line  of  DATA.\n    Fill  must  be  added  to insure that each line\
    \ of DATA,\n    FILL, and EOL exceeds the minimum transmission time of a\n   \
    \ total   scanning  line  established  in  the  premessage\n    control procedure.\
    \  The maximum length for a single line\n    of  FILL  is  5  seconds,  after\
