- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The \"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Capability\
    \ URNs\"\n   registry [RFC6241] was set up with a registration policy of\n   \"\
    Standards Action\" [RFC5226], allowing registrations only from\n   Standards Track\
    \ RFCs.  This provided thorough review of the\n   specifications that are requesting\
    \ NETCONF Capability URNs.  It has\n   turned out to be desirable to allocate\
    \ capability URNs for certain\n   Experimental RFCs also, provided those specifications\
    \ are also\n   carefully reviewed.  The existing registration policy is, therefore,\n\
    \   unnecessarily strict, requiring exception handling by the IESG.  This\n  \
    \ document changes that registration policy to \"IETF Review\", which\n   also\
    \ allows registrations from certain well-reviewed Experimental\n   RFCs, or, for\
    \ example, corrections to registry errors from\n   Informational RFCs, with IETF\
    \ review and consensus.\n"
- title: 2.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has changed the registration policy for the\
    \ \"Network\n   Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Capability URNs\" registry to\
    \ \"IETF\n   Review\" and has added this document to the registry's reference\n\
    \   field.\n   Registrations made from RFCs that are not on the Standards Track\
    \ need\n   to be carefully reviewed through IETF Last Call and in consultation\n\
    \   with relevant working groups, such as NETCONF.  The Operations and\n   Management\
    \ Area Directors should confirm that the document has\n   received the appropriate\
    \ level of review during IESG Evaluation.\n"
