For several months BBN has been supplying ARPA with a monthly summary of "Host packets output."
In response to questions from several sites, ARPA has agreed to allow us to publish these statistics in RFC form also.
Attached are the traffic statistics for the month of July 1972.
Please note that the numbers given are either monthly totals or overall averages (i.e., based on 24 hours per day, seven days a week).
Thus, these numbers are not useful in determining peak traffic conditions.
