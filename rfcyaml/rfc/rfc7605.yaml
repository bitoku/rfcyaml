- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides information and advice to application\
    \ and\n   service designers on the use of assigned transport port numbers.  It\n\
    \   provides a detailed historical background of the evolution of\n   transport\
    \ port numbers and their multiple meanings.  It also provides\n   specific recommendations\
    \ to designers on how to use assigned port\n   numbers.  Note that this document\
    \ provides information to potential\n   port number applicants that complements\
    \ the IANA process described in\n   [RFC6335] (the sole document of BCP 165 before\
    \ this document), but it\n   does not change any of the port number assignment\
    \ procedures\n   described therein.  Because they are thus so closely related,\
    \ this\n   document and RFC 6335 are now known together as BCP 165.  This\n  \
    \ document is intended to address concerns typically raised during\n   Expert\
    \ Review (see [RFC5226]) of assigned port number applications,\n   but it is not\
    \ intended to bind those reviews.  RFC 6335 also\n   describes the interaction\
    \ between port experts and port requests in\n   IETF consensus documents.  Authors\
    \ of IETF consensus documents should\n   nevertheless follow the advice in this\
    \ document and can expect\n   comment on their port requests from the port experts\
    \ during IETF Last\n   Call or at other times when review is explicitly sought.\n"

- title: 3.  History
  contents:
  - "3.  History\n   The term 'port' was first used in [RFC33] to indicate a simplex\n\
    \   communication path from an individual process and originally applied\n   to\
    \ only the Network Control Program (NCP) connection-oriented\n   protocol.  At\
    \ a meeting described in [RFC37], an idea was presented\n   to decouple connections\
    \ between processes and links that they use as\n   paths and, thus, to include\
    \ numeric source and destination socket\n   identifiers in packets.  [RFC38] provides\
    \ further detail, describing\n   how processes might have more than one of these\
    \ paths and that more\n   than one path may be active at a time.  As a result,\
    \ there was the\n   need to add a process identifier to the header of each message\
    \ so\n   that incoming messages could be demultiplexed to the appropriate\n  \
    \ process.  [RFC38] further suggests that 32-bit numbers be used for\n   these\
    \ identifiers.  [RFC48] discusses the current notion of listening\n   on a specific\
    \ port number, but does not discuss the issue of port\n   number determination.\
    \  [RFC61] notes that the challenge of knowing\n   the appropriate port numbers\
    \ is \"left to the processes\" in general,\n   but introduces the concept of a\
    \ \"well-known\" port number for common\n   services.\n   [RFC76] proposes a \"\
    telephone book\" by which an index will allow port\n   numbers to be used by name,\
    \ but still assumes that both source and\n   destination port numbers are fixed\
    \ by such a system.  [RFC333]\n   proposes that a port number pair, rather than\
    \ an individual port\n   number, be used on both sides of the connection for demultiplexing\n\
    \   messages.  This is the final view in [RFC793] (and its predecessors,\n   including\
    \ [IEN112]), and brings us to their current meaning.\n   [RFC739] introduces the\
    \ notion of generic reserved port numbers for\n   groups of protocols, such as\
    \ \"any private RJE server\" [RFC739].\n   Although the overall range of such\
    \ port numbers was (and remains) 16\n   bits, only the first 256 (high 8 bits\
    \ cleared) in the range were\n   considered assigned.\n   [RFC758] is the first\
    \ to describe port numbers as being used for TCP\n   (previous RFCs all refer\
    \ to only NCP).  It includes a list of such\n   well-known port numbers, as well\
    \ as describes ranges used for\n   different purposes:\n      Decimal   Octal\
    \     Description\n      -----------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \      0-63      0-77      Network Wide Standard Function\n      64-127    100-177\
    \   Hosts Specific Functions\n      128-223   200-337   Reserved for Future Use\n\
    \      224-255   340-377   Any Experimental Function\n   In [RFC820], those range\
    \ meanings disappear, and a single list of\n   number assignments is presented.\
    \  This is also the first time that\n   port numbers are described as applying\
    \ to a connectionless transport\n   (e.g., UDP) rather than only connection-oriented\
    \ transports.\n   By [RFC900], the ranges appear as decimal numbers rather than\
    \ the\n   octal ranges used previously.  [RFC1340] increases this range from\n\
    \   0-255 to 0-1023 and begins to list TCP and UDP port number\n   assignments\
    \ individually (although the assumption was that once\n   assigned a port number\
    \ applies to all transport protocols, including\n   TCP, UDP, recently Stream\
    \ Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and\n   Datagram Congestion Control Protocol\
    \ (DCCP), as well as ISO-TP4 for a\n   brief period in the early 1990s).  [RFC1340]\
    \ also establishes the\n   Registered range of 1024-59151, though it notes that\
    \ it is not\n   controlled by the IANA (at that point).  The list provided by\n\
    \   [RFC1700] in 1994 remained the standard until it was declared\n   replaced\
    \ by an online version, as of [RFC3232] in 2002.\n"
- title: 4.  Current Port Number Use
  contents:
  - "4.  Current Port Number Use\n   RFC 6335 indicates three ranges of port number\
    \ assignments:\n      Binary         Hex\n      -----------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \      0-1023         0x0000-0x03FF  System (also Well-Known)\n      1024-49151\
    \     0x0400-0xBFFF  User (also Registered)\n      49152-65535    0xC000-0xFFFF\
    \  Dynamic (also Private)\n   System (also Well-Known) encompasses the range 0-1023.\
    \  On some\n   systems, use of these port numbers requires privileged access,\
    \ e.g.,\n   that the process run as 'root' (i.e., as a privileged user), which\
    \ is\n   why these are referred to as System port numbers.  The port numbers\n\
    \   from 1024-49151 denotes non-privileged services, known as User (also\n   Registered),\
    \ because these port numbers do not run with special\n   privileges.  Dynamic\
    \ (also Private) port numbers are not assigned.\n   Both System and User port\
    \ numbers are assigned through IANA, so both\n   are sometimes called 'registered\
    \ port numbers'.  As a result, the\n   term 'registered' is ambiguous, referring\
    \ either to the entire range\n   0-49151 or to the User port numbers.  Complicating\
    \ matters further,\n   System port numbers do not always require special (i.e.,\
    \ 'root')\n   privilege.  For clarity, the remainder of this document refers to\
    \ the\n   port number ranges as System, User, and Dynamic, to be consistent\n\
    \   with IANA process [RFC6335].\n"
- title: 5.  What is a Port Number?
  contents:
  - "5.  What is a Port Number?\n   A port number is a 16-bit number used for two\
    \ distinct purposes:\n   o  Demultiplexing transport endpoint associations within\
    \ an end host\n   o  Identifying a service\n   The first purpose requires that\
    \ each transport endpoint association\n   (e.g., TCP connection or UDP pairwise\
    \ association) using a given\n   transport between a given pair of IP addresses\
    \ use a different pair\n   of port numbers, but it does not require either coordination\
    \ or\n   registration of port number use.  It is the second purpose that\n   drives\
    \ the need for a common registry.\n   Consider a user wanting to run a web server.\
    \  That service could run\n   on any port number, provided that all clients knew\
    \ what port number\n   to use to access that service at that host.  Such information\
    \ can be\n   explicitly distributed -- for example, by putting it in the URI:\n\
    \      http://www.example.com:51509/\n   Ultimately, the correlation of a service\
    \ with a port number is an\n   agreement between just the two endpoints of the\
    \ association.  A web\n   server can run on port number 53, which might appear\
    \ as DNS traffic\n   to others but will connect to browsers that know to use port\
    \ number\n   53 rather than 80.\n   As a concept, a service is the combination\
    \ of ISO Layers 5-7 that\n   represents an application-protocol capability.  For\
    \ example, www\n   (port number 80) is a service that uses HTTP as an application\n\
    \   protocol and provides access to a web server [RFC7230].  However, it\n   is\
    \ possible to use HTTP for other purposes, such as command and\n   control.  This\
    \ is why some current services (HTTP, e.g.) are a bit\n   overloaded -- they describe\
    \ not only the application protocol, but a\n   particular service.\n   IANA assigns\
    \ port numbers so that Internet endpoints do not need\n   pairwise, explicit coordination\
    \ of the meaning of their port numbers.\n   This is the primary reason for requesting\
    \ port number assignment by\n   IANA -- to have a common agreement between all\
    \ endpoints on the\n   Internet as to the default meaning of a port number, which\
    \ provides\n   the endpoints with a default port number for a particular protocol\
    \ or\n   service.\n   Port numbers are sometimes used by intermediate devices\
    \ on a network\n   path, either to monitor available services, to monitor traffic\
    \ (e.g.,\n   to indicate the data contents), or to intercept traffic (to block,\n\
    \   proxy, relay, aggregate, or otherwise process it).  In each case, the\n  \
    \ intermediate device interprets traffic based on the port number.  It\n   is\
    \ important to recognize that any interpretation of port numbers --\n   except\
    \ at the endpoints -- may be incorrect, because port numbers are\n   meaningful\
    \ only at the endpoints.  Further, port numbers may not be\n   visible to these\
    \ intermediate devices, such as when the transport\n   protocol is encrypted (as\
    \ in network- or link-layer tunnels) or when\n   a packet is fragmented (in which\
    \ case only the first fragment has the\n   port number information).  Such port\
    \ number invisibility may\n   interfere with these capabilities, which are implemented\
    \ inside the\n   network and based on a port number.\n   Port numbers can also\
    \ be used for other purposes.  Assigned port\n   numbers can simplify end-system\
    \ configuration, so that individual\n   installations do not need to coordinate\
    \ their use of arbitrary port\n   numbers.  Such assignments may also have the\
    \ effect of simplifying\n   firewall management, so that a single, fixed firewall\
    \ configuration\n   can either permit or deny a service that uses the assigned\
    \ ports.\n   It is useful to differentiate a port number from a service name.\
    \  The\n   former is a numeric value that is used directly in transport protocol\n\
    \   headers as a demultiplexing and service identifier.  The latter is\n   primarily\
    \ a user convenience, where the default map between the two\n   is considered\
    \ static and resolved using a cached index.  This\n   document focuses on the\
    \ former because it is the fundamental network\n   resource.  Dynamic maps between\
    \ the two, i.e., using DNS SRV records,\n   are discussed further in Section 7.1.\n"
- title: 6.  Conservation
  contents:
  - "6.  Conservation\n   Assigned port numbers are a limited resource that is globally\
    \ shared\n   by the entire Internet community.  As of 2014, approximately 5850\
    \ TCP\n   and 5570 UDP port numbers had been assigned out of a total range of\n\
    \   49151.  As a result of past conservation, current assigned port use\n   is\
    \ small and the current rate of assignment avoids the need for\n   transition\
    \ to larger number spaces.  This conservation also helps\n   avoid the need for\
    \ IANA to rely on assigned port number reclamation,\n   which is practically impossible\
    \ even though procedurally permitted\n   [RFC6335].\n   IANA aims to assign only\
    \ one port number per service, including\n   variants [RFC6335], but there are\
    \ other benefits to using fewer port\n   numbers for a given service.  Use of\
    \ multiple assigned port numbers\n   can make applications more fragile, especially\
    \ when firewalls block a\n   subset of those port numbers or use ports numbers\
    \ to route or\n   prioritize traffic differently.  As a result:\n   >> Each assigned\
    \ port requested MUST be justified by the applicant as\n   an independently useful\
    \ service.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Guiding Principles
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Guiding Principles\n   This document provides recommendations for users\
    \ that also help\n   conserve assigned port number space.  Again, this document\
    \ does not\n   update [RFC6335] (originally the sole document of BCP 165), which\n\
    \   describes the IANA procedures for managing assigned transport port\n   numbers\
    \ and services, but rather augments it by now becoming part of\n   BCP 165 (i.e.,\
    \ BCP 165 now refers to both documents together).\n   Assigned port number conservation\
    \ is based on a number of basic\n   principles:\n   o  A single assigned port\
    \ number can support different functions over\n      separate endpoint associations,\
    \ determined using in-band\n      information.  An FTP data connection can transfer\
    \ binary or text\n      files, the latter translating line-terminators, as indicated\
    \ in-\n      band over the control port number [RFC959].\n   o  A single assigned\
    \ port number can indicate the Dynamic port\n      number(s) on which different\
    \ capabilities are supported, as with\n      passive-mode FTP [RFC959].\n   o\
    \  Several existing services can indicate the Dynamic port number(s)\n      on\
    \ which other services are supported, such as with Multicast DNS\n      (mDNS)\
    \ and portmapper [RFC1833] [RFC6762] [RFC6763].\n   o  Copies of some existing\
    \ services can be differentiated using in-\n      band information (e.g., URIs\
    \ in the HTTP Host field and TLS Server\n      Name Indication extension) [RFC7230]\
    \ [RFC6066].\n   o  Services requiring varying performance properties can already\
    \ be\n      supported using separate endpoint associations (connections or\n \
    \     other associations), each configured to support the desired\n      properties.\
    \  For example, a high-speed and low-speed variant can\n      be determined within\
    \ the service using the same assigned port.\n   Assigned port numbers are intended\
    \ to differentiate services, not\n   variations of performance, replicas, pairwise\
    \ endpoint associations,\n   or payload types.  Assigned port numbers are also\
    \ a small space\n   compared to other Internet number spaces; it is never appropriate\
    \ to\n   consume assigned port numbers to conserve larger spaces such as IP\n\
    \   addresses, especially where copies of a service represent different\n   endpoints.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Firewall and NAT Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Firewall and NAT Considerations\n   Ultimately, port numbers indicate services\
    \ only to the endpoints, and\n   any intermediate device that assigns meaning\
    \ to a value can be\n   incorrect.  End systems might agree to run web services\
    \ (HTTP) over\n   port number 53 (typically used for DNS) rather than port number\
    \ 80,\n   at which point a firewall that blocks port number 80 but permits port\n\
    \   number 53 would not have the desired effect.  Nonetheless, assigned\n   port\
    \ numbers are often used to help configure firewalls and other\n   port-based\
    \ systems for access control.\n   Using Dynamic port numbers, or explicitly indicated\
    \ port numbers\n   indicated in-band over another service (such as with FTP) often\n\
    \   complicates firewall and NAT interactions [RFC959].  FTP over\n   firewalls\
    \ often requires direct support for deep-packet inspection\n   (to snoop for the\
    \ Dynamic port number for the NAT to correctly map)\n   or passive-mode FTP (in\
    \ which both connections are opened from the\n   client side).\n"
- title: 7.  Considerations for Requesting Port Number Assignments
  contents:
  - "7.  Considerations for Requesting Port Number Assignments\n   Port numbers are\
    \ assigned by IANA by a set of documented procedures\n   [RFC6335].  The following\
    \ section describes the steps users can take\n   to help assist with responsible\
    \ use of assigned port numbers and with\n   preparing an application for a port\
    \ number assignment.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Is a port number assignment necessary?
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Is a port number assignment necessary?\n   First, it is useful to consider\
    \ whether a port number assignment is\n   required.  In many cases, a new number\
    \ assignment may not be needed.\n   The following questions may aid in making\
    \ this determination:\n   o  Is this really a new service or could an existing\
    \ service suffice?\n   o  Is this an experimental service [RFC3692]?  If so, consider\
    \ using\n      the current experimental ports [RFC2780].\n   o  Is this service\
    \ independently useful?  Some systems are composed\n      from collections of\
    \ different service capabilities, but not all\n      component functions are useful\
    \ as independent services.  Port\n      numbers are typically shared among the\
    \ smallest independently\n      useful set of functions.  Different service uses\
    \ or properties can\n      be supported in separate pairwise endpoint associations\
    \ after an\n      initial negotiation, e.g., to support software decomposition.\n\
    \   o  Can this service use a Dynamic port number that is coordinated\n      out-of-band?\
    \  For example:\n      o  By explicit configuration of both endpoints.\n     \
    \ o  By internal mechanisms within the same host (e.g., a\n         configuration\
    \ file, indicated within a URI or using\n         interprocess communication).\n\
    \      o  Using information exchanged on a related service: FTP [RFC959],\n  \
    \       SIP [RFC3261], etc.\n      o  Using an existing port discovery service:\
    \ portmapper [RFC1833],\n         mDNS [RFC6762] [RFC6763], etc.\n   There are\
    \ a few good examples of reasons that more directly suggest\n   that not only\
    \ is a port number assignment not necessary, but it is\n   directly counter-indicated:\n\
    \   o  Assigned port numbers are not intended to differentiate\n      performance\
    \ variations within the same service, e.g., high-speed\n      versus ordinary\
    \ speed.  Performance variations can be supported\n      within a single assigned\
    \ port number in context of separate\n      pairwise endpoint associations.\n\
    \   o  Additional assigned port numbers are not intended to replicate an\n   \
    \   existing service.  For example, if a device is configured to use a\n     \
    \ typical web browser, then the port number used for that service is\n      a\
    \ copy of the http service that is already assigned to port number\n      80 and\

    \ happens to use HTTP framing -- but is not primarily\n      accessed by a browser\
    \ -- might be a new service.  A good way to\n      tell is to ask, \"Can an unmodified\
    \ client of the existing service\n      interact with the proposed service?\"\
    .  If so, that service would\n      be a copy of an existing service and would\
    \ not merit a new\n      assignment.\n   o  Assigned port numbers not intended\
    \ for intra-machine\n      communication.  Such communication can already be supported\
    \ by\n      internal mechanisms (interprocess communication, shared memory,\n\
    \      shared files, etc.).  When Internet communication within a host is\n  \
    \    desired, the server can bind to a Dynamic port that is indicated\n      to\
    \ the client using these internal mechanisms.\n   o  Separate assigned port numbers\
    \ are not intended for insecure\n      versions of existing (or new) secure services.\
    \  A service that\n      already requires security would be made more vulnerable\
    \ by having\n      the same capability accessible without security.\n      Note\
    \ that the converse is different, i.e., it can be useful to\n      create a new,\
    \ secure service that replicates an existing insecure\n      service on a new\
    \ port number assignment.  This can be necessary\n      when the existing service\
    \ is not backward-compatible with security\n      enhancements, such as the use\
    \ of TLS [RFC5246] or DTLS [RFC6347].\n   o  Assigned port numbers are not intended\
    \ for indicating different\n      service versions.  Version differentiation should\
    \ be handled in-\n      band, e.g., using a version number at the beginning of\
    \ an\n      association (e.g., connection or other transaction).  This may not\n\
    \      be possible with legacy assignments, but all new services should\n    \
    \  incorporate support for version indication.\n   Some services may not need\
    \ assigned port numbers at all, e.g., SIP\n   allows voice calls to use Dynamic\
    \ ports [RFC3261].  Some systems can\n   register services in the DNS, using SRV\
    \ entries.  These services can\n   be discovered by a variety of means, including\
    \ mDNS, or via direct\n   query [RFC6762] [RFC6763].  In such cases, users can\
    \ more easily\n   request an SRV name, which are assigned first-come, first-served\
    \ from\n   a much larger namespace.\n   IANA assigns port numbers, but this assignment\
    \ is typically used only\n   for servers, i.e., the host that listens for incoming\
    \ connections or\n   other associations.  Clients, i.e., hosts that initiate connections\n\
    \   or other associations, typically refer to those assigned port numbers\n  \
    \ but do not need port number assignments for their endpoint.\n   Finally, an\
    \ assigned port number is not a guarantee of exclusive use.\n   Traffic for any\
    \ service might appear on any port number, due to\n   misconfiguration or deliberate\
    \ misuse.  Application and service\n   designers are encouraged to validate traffic\
    \ based on its content.\n"

    \ number consumption.\n   Although some may be cumbersome or inefficient, they\
    \ are nearly\n   always preferable to consuming additional port number assignments.\n\
    \   Such techniques include:\n   o  Use of a discovery service, either a shared\

- title: 7.3.  Picking an Assigned Port Number
  contents:
  - "7.3.  Picking an Assigned Port Number\n   Given a demonstrated need for a port\
    \ number assignment, the next\n   question is how to pick the desired port number.\
    \  An application for\n   a port number assignment does not need to include a\
    \ desired port\n   number; in that case, IANA will select from those currently\n\
    \   available.\n   Users should consider whether the requested port number is\
    \ important.\n   For example, would an assignment be acceptable if IANA picked\
    \ the\n   port number value?  Would a TCP (or other transport protocol) port\n\
    \   number assignment be useful by itself?  If so, a port number can be\n   assigned\
    \ to a service for one transport protocol where it is already\n   (or can be subsequently)\
    \ assigned to a different service for other\n   transport protocols.\n   The most\
    \ critical issue in picking a number is selecting the desired\n   range, i.e.,\
    \ System versus User port numbers.  The distinction was\n   intended to indicate\
    \ a difference in privilege; originally, System\n   port numbers required privileged\
    \ ('root') access, while User port\n   numbers did not.  That distinction has\
    \ since blurred because some\n   current systems do not limit access control to\
    \ System port numbers\n   and because some System services have been replicated\
    \ on User numbers\n   (e.g., IRC).  Even so, System port number assignments have\
    \ continued\n   at an average rate of 3-4 per year over the past 7 years (2007-2013),\n\
    \   indicating that the desire to keep this distinction continues.\n   As a result,\
    \ the difference between System and User port numbers\n   needs to be treated\
    \ with caution.  Developers are advised to treat\n   services as if they are always\
    \ run without privilege.\n   Even when developers seek a System port number assignment,\
    \ it may be\n   very difficult to obtain.  System port number assignment requires\n\
    \   IETF Review or IESG Approval and justification that both User and\n   Dynamic\
    \ port number ranges are insufficient [RFC6335].  Thus, this\n   document recommends\
    \ both:\n   >> Developers SHOULD NOT apply for System port number assignments\n\
    \   because the increased privilege they are intended to provide is not\n   always\
    \ enforced.\n   >> System implementers SHOULD enforce the need for privilege for\n\
    \   processes to listen on System port numbers.\n   At some future date, it might\
    \ be useful to deprecate the distinction\n   between System and User port numbers\
    \ altogether.  Services typically\n   require elevated ('root') privileges to\
    \ bind to a System port number,\n   but many such services go to great lengths\
    \ to immediately drop those\n   privileges just after connection or other association\
    \ establishment\n   to reduce the impact of an attack using their capabilities.\
    \  Such\n   services might be more securely operated on User port numbers than\
    \ on\n   System port numbers.  Further, if System port numbers were no longer\n\
    \   assigned, as of 2014 it would cost only 180 of the 1024 System values\n  \
    \ (17%), or 180 of the overall 49152 assigned (System and User) values\n   (<0.04%).\n"
- title: 7.4.  Support for Security
  contents:
  - "7.4.  Support for Security\n   Just as a service is a way to obtain information\
    \ or processing from a\n   host over a network, a service can also be the opening\
    \ through which\n   to compromise that host.  Protecting a service involves security,\n\
    \   which includes integrity protection, source authentication, privacy,\n   or\
    \ any combination of these capabilities.  Security can be provided\n   in a number\
    \ of ways, and thus:\n   >> New services SHOULD support security capabilities,\
    \ either directly\n   or via a content protection such as TLS [RFC5246] or Datagram\
    \ TLS\n   (DTLS) [RFC6347], or transport protection such as the TCP-AO\n   [RFC5925].\
    \  Insecure versions of new or existing secure services\n   SHOULD be avoided\
    \ because of the new vulnerability they create.\n   Secure versions of legacy\
    \ services that are not already security-\n   capable via in-band negotiations\
    \ can be very useful.  However, there\n   is no IETF consensus on when separate\
    \ ports should be used for secure\n   and insecure variants of the same service\
    \ [RFC2595] [RFC2817]\n   [RFC6335].  The overall preference is for use of a single\
    \ port, as\n   noted in Section 6 of this document and Section 7.2 of [RFC6335],\
    \ but\n   the appropriate approach depends on the specific characteristics of\n\
    \   the service.  As a result:\n   >> When requesting both secure and insecure\
    \ port assignments for the\n   same service, justification is expected for the\
    \ utility and safety of\n   each port as an independent service (Section 6). \
    \ Precedent (e.g.,\n   citing other protocols that use a separate insecure port)\
    \ is\n   inadequate justification by itself.\n   It's also important to recognize\
    \ that port number assignment is not\n   itself a guarantee that traffic using\
    \ that number provides the\n   corresponding service or that a given service is\
    \ always offered only\n   on its assigned port number.  Port numbers are ultimately\
    \ meaningful\n   only between endpoints and any service can be run on any port.\
    \  Thus:\n   >> Security SHOULD NOT rely on assigned port number distinctions\n\
    \   alone; every service, whether secure or not, is likely to be\n   attacked.\n\
    \   Applications for a new service that requires both a secure and\n   insecure\
    \ port may be found, on Expert Review, to be unacceptable, and\n   may not be\
    \ approved for allocation.  Similarly, an application for a\n   new port to support\
    \ an insecure variant of an existing secure\n   protocol may be found unacceptable.\
    \  In both cases, the resulting\n   security of the service in practice will be\
    \ a significant\n   consideration in the decision as to whether to assign an insecure\n\
    \   port.\n"

- title: 7.6.  Transport Protocols
  contents:
  - "7.6.  Transport Protocols\n   IANA assigns port numbers specific to one or more\
    \ transport\n   protocols, typically UDP [RFC768] and TCP [RFC793], but also SCTP\n\
    \   [RFC4960], DCCP [RFC4340], and any other standard transport protocol.\n  \
    \ Originally, IANA port number assignments were concurrent for both UDP\n   and\
    \ TCP, and other transports were not indicated.  However, to\n   conserve the\
    \ assigned port number space and to reflect increasing use\n   of other transports,\
    \ assignments are now specific only to the\n   transport being used.\n   In general,\
    \ a service should request assignments for multiple\n   transports using the same\
    \ service name and description on the same\n   port number only when they all\
    \ reflect essentially the same service.\n   Good examples of such use are DNS\
    \ and NFS, where the difference\n   between the UDP and TCP services are specific\
    \ to supporting each\n   transport.  For example, the UDP variant of a service\
    \ might add\n   sequence numbers and the TCP variant of the same service might\
    \ add\n   in-band message delimiters.  This document does not describe the\n \
    \  appropriate selection of a transport protocol for a service.\n   >> Service\
    \ names and descriptions for multiple transport port number\n   assignments SHOULD\
    \ match only when they describe the same service,\n   excepting only enhancements\
    \ for each supported transport.\n   When the services differ, it may be acceptable\
    \ or preferable to use\n   the same port number, but the service names and descriptions\
    \ should\n   be different for each transport/service pair, reflecting the\n  \
    \ differences in the services.  For example, if TCP is used for the\n   basic\
    \ control protocol and UDP for an alarm protocol, then the\n   services might\
    \ be \"name-ctl\" and \"name-alarm\".  A common example is\n   when TCP is used\
    \ for a service and UDP is used to determine whether\n   that service is active\
    \ (e.g., via a unicast, broadcast, or multicast\n   test message) [RFC1122]. \
    \ IANA has, for several years, used the\n   suffix \"-disc\" in service names\
    \ to distinguish discovery services,\n   such as are used to identify endpoints\
    \ capable of a given service.\n   >> Names of discovery services SHOULD use an\
    \ identifiable suffix; the\n   suggestion is \"-disc\".\n   Some services are\
    \ used for discovery, either in conjunction with a\n   TCP service or as a stand-alone\
    \ capability.  Such services will be\n   more reliable when using multicast rather\
    \ than broadcast (over IPv4)\n   because IP routers do not forward \"all nodes\"\
    \ broadcasts (all 1's,\n   i.e., 255.255.255.255 for IPv4) and have not been required\
    \ to support\n   subnet-directed broadcasts since 1999 [RFC1812] [RFC2644].\n\
    \   This issue is relevant only for IPv4 because IPv6 does not support\n   broadcast.\n\
    \   >> UDP over IPv4 multi-host services SHOULD use multicast rather than\n  \
    \ broadcast.\n   Designers should be very careful in creating services over transports\n\
    \   that do not support congestion control or error recovery, notably\n   UDP.\
    \  There are several issues that should be considered in such\n   cases, as summarized\
    \ in Table 1 in [RFC5405].  In addition, the\n   following recommendations apply\
    \ to service design:\n   >> Services that use multipoint communication SHOULD\
    \ be scalable and\n   SHOULD NOT rely solely on the efficiency of multicast transmission\n\
    \   for scalability.\n   >> Services SHOULD NOT use UDP as a performance enhancement\

  contents:
  - "7.7.  When to Request an Assignment\n   Assignments are typically requested when\
    \ a user has enough\n   information to reasonably answer the questions in the\
    \ IANA\n   application.  IANA applications typically take up to a few weeks to\n\
    \   process, with some complex cases taking up to a month.  The process\n   typically\
    \ involves a few exchanges between the IANA Ports Expert\n   Review team and the\
    \ applicant.\n   An application needs to include a description of the service,\
    \ as well\n   as to address key questions designed to help IANA determine whether\n\
    \   the assignment is justified.  The application should be complete and\n   not\
    \ refer solely to an Internet-Draft, RFC, website, or any other\n   external documentation.\n\
    \   Services that are independently developed can be requested at any\n   time,\
    \ but are typically best requested in the last stages of design\n   and initial\
    \ experimentation, before any deployment has occurred that\n   cannot easily be\
    \ updated.\n   >> Users MUST NOT deploy implementations that use assigned port\n\
    \   numbers prior their assignment by IANA.\n   >> Users MUST NOT deploy implementations\
    \ that default to using the\n   experimental System port numbers (1021 and 1022\
    \ [RFC4727]) outside a\n   controlled environment where they can be updated with\
    \ a subsequent\n   assigned port [RFC3692].\n   Deployments that use unassigned\
    \ port numbers before assignment\n   complicate IANA management of the port number\
    \ space.  Keep in mind\n   that this recommendation protects existing assignees,\
    \ users of\n   current services, and applicants for new assignments; it helps\
    \ ensure\n   that a desired number and service name are available when assigned.\n\
    \   The list of currently unassigned numbers is just that -- *currently*\n   unassigned.\
    \  It does not reflect pending applications.  Waiting for\n   an official IANA\
    \ assignment reduces the chance that an assignment\n   request will conflict with\
    \ another deployed service.\n   Applications made through Internet-Draft posting\
    \ or RFC publication\n   (in any stream) typically use a placeholder (\"PORTNUM\"\
    ) in the text,\n   and implementations use an experimental port number until a\
    \ final\n   assignment has been made [RFC6335].  That assignment is initially\n\
    \   indicated in the IANA Considerations section of the document, which\n   is\
    \ tracked by the RFC Editor.  When a document has been approved for\n   publication,\
    \ that request is forwarded to IANA for handling.  IANA\n   will make the new\
    \ assignment accordingly.  At that time, IANA may\n   also request that the applicant\
    \ fill out the application form on\n   their website, e.g., when the RFC does\
    \ not directly address the\n   information expected as per [RFC6335].  \"Early\"\
