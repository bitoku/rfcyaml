  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the plan to transition responsibility\
    \ for\n   bridging-related MIB modules from the IETF Bridge MIB WG to the IEEE\n\
    \   802.1 WG, which develops the bridging technology the MIB modules are\n   designed\
    \ to manage.  The current Bridge MIB WG documents are\n   o  \"Definitions of\
    \ Managed Objects for Bridges\" [RFC4188],\n   o  \"Definitions of Managed Objects\
    \ for Bridges with Rapid Spanning\n      Tree Protocol\" [RFC4318]\n   o  \"Definitions\
    \ of Managed Objects for Bridges with Traffic Classes,\n      Multicast Filtering,\
    \ and Virtual LAN Extensions\" [RFC4363], and\n   o  \"Definitions of Managed\
    \ Objects for Source Routing Bridges\"\n      [RFC1525].\n   This document is\
    \ meant to establish some clear expectations between\n   IETF and IEEE about the\
    \ transition of Bridge MIB WG MIB modules to\n   the IEEE 802.1 WG, so that the\
    \ plan can be reviewed by the IESG, IAB,\n   IETF, and IEEE.  Some case-by-case\
    \ situations might arise, which will\n   be handled by the appropriate liaisons,\
    \ but this document describes\n   the general strategy.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Motivation\n   Having SNMP MIB modules to provide management functionality\
    \ for its\n   technologies is important for the 802.1 community, so it needs to\n\
    \   charter this work as part of the Project Authorization Requests\n   (PARs)\
    \ for each new project, to ensure that resources are being\n   mobilized for execution.\
    \  This is also true with respect to MIB\n   support for already completed 802.1\
    \ projects - maintenance projects\n   need to include the development of SNMP\
    \ MIB modules.\n   The IESG has mandated that IETF WGs that produce a protocol\
    \ are also\n   required to develop the corresponding MIB module rather than leave\n\
    \   that to \"the SNMP experts\" to do later.  Part of the motivation was\n  \
    \ obviously to make the protocols more manageable, but part of the\n   motivation\
    \ was also balancing the workload better and getting the\n   content experts more\
    \ involved in the management design.  If such work\n   comes into the IETF from\
    \ other standards development organizations\n   (SDOs), then we encourage the\
    \ other SDO to bring in subject matter\n   expertise to work with us, or, even\
    \ better, to take the lead\n   themselves.\n   The manpower problem is certainly\
    \ an aspect that is relevant.  IEEE\n   802 MIB documents could be developed in\
    \ the IETF, but only if the\n   subject matter experts come to IETF to participate\
    \ in (lead) the\n   work.  The content experts need to be more involved in the\
    \ MIB module\n   development, and resources need to be dedicated to completing\
    \ the\n   work, whether editing is done in the IEEE or the IETF.  The IETF\n \
    \  finds it acceptable if other organizations (like IEEE 802) do MIB\n   documents\
    \ themselves, and the IETF offers to help review them from an\n   SNMP/MIB/Structure\
    \ of Management Information (SMI) perspective.  This\n   is true even after the\
    \ transition, since quality MIB modules are\n   important for smooth management\
    \ of the Internet and the technologies\n   it runs on.\n"

- title: 2.1.  New MIB PARs
  contents:
  - "2.1.  New MIB PARs\n   The IEEE-SA Standards Board New Standards Committee (NesCom)\
    \ deals\n   with the Projects Approval Requests; see\n   http://standards.ieee.org/board/nes/.\
    \  PARs are roughly the\n   equivalent of IETF Working Group Charters and include\
    \ information\n   concerning the scope, purpose, and justification for standardization\n\
    \   projects.\n   Following early discussions concerning the transfer of MIB work\
    \ from\n   the IETF Bridge MIB WG to the IEEE 802.1 WG, the development of SMIv2\n\
    \   MIB modules associated with IEEE 802.1 projects has been included\n   within\
    \ the scope of the work of new projects.\n   The latest Project Approval Requests\
    \ (PAR) of the 802.1 projects,\n   starting with the P802.1ah (Provider Backbone\
    \ Bridges) approved in\n   December 2004, include explicit text on this respect.\n\
    \   For example, the PAR form of the IEEE 802.1ah, Provider Backbone\n   Bridges\
    \ [PAR-IEEE802.1ah], includes in Section 13, \"Scope of Proposed\n   Project\"\
    , an explicit reference to 'support management including\n   SNMP'.\n   Although\
    \ it is not mandatory that the MIB development work be\n   specified explicitly\
    \ in a new PAR to have the work done (see work\n   done in IEEE 802.1AB [IEEE802.1AB]\
    \ and IEEE 802.1AE [IEEE802.1AE]),\n   it is recommended that IEEE 802.1 WG PARs\
    \ include explicit wording in\n   the scope section wherever there is a need for\
    \ MIB development as\n   part of the standard.\n   Since the IETF Bridge MIB WG\
    \ does not intend to develop MIB modules\n   in the future, submitters of new\
    \ work in the bridge management space\n   should be directed to the IEEE 802.1\
    \ WG, and it should be recommended\n   that they not publish their proposed MIB\
    \ modules as Internet-Drafts.\n"
- title: 2.2.  IEEE MIB Modules in ASCII Format
  contents:
  - "2.2.  IEEE MIB Modules in ASCII Format\n   Making MIB modules freely and openly\
    \ available in an ASCII format\n   will be a critical factor in having the SNMP\
    \ community accept the\n   transfer of 802.1 MIB development from IETF Bridge\
    \ MIB WG to IEEE\n   802.1 WG.  Although 802.1 can certainly decide to publish\
    \ MIB modules\n   only in the PDF format that they use for their documents, without\n\
    \   publishing an ASCII version, most network management systems can\n   import\
    \ a MIB module that is in ASCII format but not one in PDF\n   format.  Not publishing\
    \ an ASCII version of the MIB module would\n   negatively impact implementers\
    \ and deployers of MIB modules and would\n   make IETF review of MIB modules more\
    \ difficult.\n   The 802.1 WG web site requires a password for access to standards\
    \ in\n   development.  The WG has started making the MIB module portion of\n \
    \  their documents available as separate ASCII files during project\n   development\
    \ and allowing IETF participants to access these documents\n   for pre-standard\
    \ review purposes.\n   IEEE 802 has a policy whereby approved specifications are\
    \ available\n   for a fee for the first six months after approval, and freely\n\
    \   available six months after they are approved.  Once the specification\n  \
    \ is approved, the ASCII version of the MIB module is made freely\n   available\
    \ on the 802.1 WG website (see\n   http://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/MIBs/\
    \ or\n   http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/MIBS.html).\n   There may be some issues\
    \ about what gets included in the freely\n   available specification.  The SMIv2\
    \ MIB module alone will probably be\n   insufficient; some discussion of the structure\
    \ of the MIB, the\n   relationship to other MIB modules, and security considerations\
    \ will\n   also need to be made available to ensure appropriate implementation\n\
    \   and deployment of the MIB module within the Internet environment.\n   For\
    \ most implementers, the freely available specification six months\n   after approval\
    \ will be adequate.\n"
- title: 2.3.  OID Registration for New MIB Modules
  contents:
  - "2.3.  OID Registration for New MIB Modules\n   The IETF and IEEE 802 have separate\
    \ registration branches (arcs) in\n   the Object Identifier (OID) tree.  The Bridge\
    \ MIB modules are\n   registered under the IETF branch, and some assignments are\
    \ maintained\n   by IANA.  The administration of the IEEE 802 arc is documented\
    \ in\n   [IEEE.802b].\n   As the IEEE 802.1 WG updates the IEEE 802.1 standards,\
    \ the changes\n   may include needed modifications to supplement the existing\
    \ tables.\n   This can be handled by developing an IEEE MIB module that augments\n\
    \   the existing tables, or that reuses the indexing of the existing\n   tables.\
    \  The new modules can be registered under the 802.1\n   registration branch,\
    \ as was done with the 802.1X MIB module.\n   When the changes only require the\
    \ addition of one or two objects to\n   the existing MIB modules, it may seem\
    \ simpler for the 802.1 WG to\n   define additional managed objects within the\
    \ IANA-controlled\n   registration tree.  This approach is not recommended because\
    \ of the\n   difficulties of coordinating the changes between the two\n   organizations,\
    \ and of working the changes through the processes while\n   trying to remain\
    \ timely for each organization.  Such additions would\n   probably require approval\
    \ by the Area Directors of Operations and\n   Management after IETF MIB Doctor\
    \ review.  This would create\n   dependencies between the work of the two organizations,\
    \ and it might\n   generate special cases for IANA to prevent the IEEE from being\
    \ bogged\n   down by IETF processes.\n   The approach of developing an IEEE MIB\
    \ module and defining a new\n   compliance clause is simpler than dealing with\
    \ such dependencies.\n   We need a balance between disruption to existing implementations\
    \ and\n   efficiency in making changes.  Keeping the existing trees in their\n\
    \   place minimizes disruption to existing implementations.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Transferring Current Bridge MIB WG Documents\n   During review of the legal\
    \ issues associated with transferring Bridge\n   MIB WG documents to the IEEE\
    \ 802.1 WG, it was concluded that the IETF\n   does not have sufficient legal\
    \ authority to make the transfer without\n   the consent of the document authors.\n\
    \   RFC1286, RFC1493, and RFC1525 apparently precede any specific IETF\n   document\
    \ describing the copyright and intellectual property rights\n   that authors grant\
    \ to the IETF.  RFC2674 falls under RFC 2026\n   [RFC2026] rules.  The three recent\
    \ updates, [RFC4188], [RFC4318], and\n   [RFC4363], fall under BCP 78, as documented\
    \ in RFC3978 [RFC3978].\n   To permit them to perform maintenance and development\
    \ of derivations\n   works from documents containing the BRIDGE-MIB [RFC4188],\
    \ P-BRIDGE-\n   MIB, Q-BRIDGE-MIB [RFC4363], and RSTP-MIB [RFC4318], the IEEE\
    \ 802.1\n   WG will need to get permission from the authors and/or the companies\n\
    \   to whom the authors have assigned their intellectual property rights\n   in\
    \ these documents.\n   The IETF legal counsel for IPR matters and the IEEE Standards\n\
    \   Association Manager of Standards Intellectual Property have agreed\n   upon\
    \ a sample letter for use by the IEEE 802.1 WG to request the\n   necessary permissions\
    \ from the authors, which is shown in Appendix B.\n   The Bridge MIB WG chairs\
    \ reviewed the author lists for the documents\n   and provided the list of authors\
    \ and their last known addresses and\n   the documents with which they were associated\
    \ to the IEEE Standards\n   Association Manager of Standards Intellectual Property.\n\
    \   The IETF will retain all the rights granted at the time of\n   publication\
    \ in the published RFCs.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Updating IETF MIB Modules
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Updating IETF MIB Modules\n   The updates to the Bridge MIB WG documents\
    \ addressed changes\n   documented in 802.1t, 802.1u, 802.1v, and 802.1w.  These\
    \ amendments\n   were merged with 802.1D-1998 by the IEEE 802.1 WG to form\n \
    \  802.1D-2004.  The Bridge MIB WG did not address changes that resulted\n   from\
    \ that merger of documents.\n   The 802.1 WG will need to work through the management\
    \ objects in the\n   existing documents to determine whether they are consistent\
    \ with new\n   emerging specifications, including 802.1D-2004.  During the final\n\
    \   work on these documents in the Bridge MIB WG, there were some issues\n   that\
    \ we decided not to resolve, which allows them to be dealt with as\n   part of\
    \ the future work in the 802.1 WG.\n   Work on the following items was deferred\
    \ to the IEEE:\n   o  The 'autoEdgePort' parameter (802.1D-2004 clause 17.3.3).\n\
    \   o  The BridgeID object.\n   o  References to 802.1D-1998 were not updated\
    \ to 802.1D-2004.\n   o  Some objects in RFC4363 may have been obsoleted in 802.1D-2004\n\
    \   o  Description of dot1dPortOutboundAccessPriority seems wrong, but it\n  \
    \    followed the description in 802.1D-1998.\n   o  An issue was raised concerning\
    \ dot1dTpPortInFrames and\n      dot1dTpPortOutFrames.  This is an issue left\
    \ over from RFC 1493.\n   It was thought that the IEEE might be able to write\
    \ separate\n   documents containing updates to their technologies, such as 802.1Q,\n\
    \   and to include a separate MIB module to augment the IETF MIB modules.\n  \
    \ However, recent changes to the IEEE standards are expected to require\n   that\
    \ the way the MIB tables are INDEXED be changed, which is not\n   allowed under\
    \ SMI rules, so the IEEE will need to rewrite the MIB\n   modules and assign object\
    \ identifiers under the ieee802 branch.\n   For backwards compatibility, the existing\
    \ IETF documents will still\n   be valid and remain unchanged.\n   If an 802.1\
    \ WG document must update or obsolete the IETF version of a\n   Bridge MIB document,\
    \ the 802.1 WG can create and submit an internet-\n   draft to the IESG to be\
    \ published as an RFC that points to the openly\n   available IEEE copy and the\
    \ IEEE standard.  The IESG would need to\n   approve the publication of the RFC.\
    \  The RFC status would be\n   reflected in the RFC-INDEX and also in the database,\
    \ so it will be\n   reflected on the RFC-Editor web page.  Thus, we don't have\
    \ a problem\n   with synchronization between the copies being published.\n"

    \ allows definitions to be clarified in a manner that can actually\n   alter the\
    \ semantics of a managed variable somewhat, such as by\n   changing the range.\
    \  SMI rules generally prevent changing the\n   semantics of defined MIB objects\
    \ without obsoleting the current\n   object and replacing it with an object with\
    \ a new descriptor and OID\n   registration.  It is expected that, once both an\
    \ IEEE MIB definition\n   and the \"managed variable\" descriptions are in the\
    \ same document,\n   this problem will go away, as IEEE can update both at the\
    \ same time\n   in the approved manner.\n   The need to fix a description in an\
    \ IETF Bridge MIB module in a\n   manner that would not be SMI legal would precipitate\
    \ the need to\n   define an IEEE MIB module, which might copy and replace the\
    \ whole\n   IETF MIB module or just add the necessary objects.  Copying the IETF\n\
    \   MIB module, changing the descriptors, and reassigning new IEEE OIDs\n   would\
    \ not be backwards compatible, and existing applications would\n   need to be\
    \ updated to access the new objects.  Therefore it is\n   recommended that the\
    \ IETF MIB module not be copied and modified\n   unless doing so is really necessary.\n\
    \   The current practice in the 802.1 WG is to define the management\n   variables\
    \ and then a mapping table to associated MIB module objects\n   (as shown above).\
    \  The 802.1 WG could redefine the mapping from an\n   IEEE managed variable to\
    \ a new IEEE MIB object if the 802.1\n   management variable semantics changed,\
    \ thus allowing the 802.1 WG to\n   'do it right' by SMI rules, supplementing\
    \ the old MIB object with a\n   new one.  An updated mapping would be reflected\
    \ in the compliance\n   clause of the supplemental SMIv2 MIB module; it may be\
    \ desirable to\n   document the old mapping information in the description clause\
    \ of the\n   new object in the SMIv2 MIB module.\n   Often, the mapping of 802\
    \ variables to MIB objects isn't a 1:1\n   mapping and doesn't have to be.  In\
    \ the future, 802.1 variables may\n   be invented with Web-based services in mind,\
    \ but today the primary\n   focus is on SNMP usage, and incorporating MIB modules\
    \ into the specs\n   themselves will likely further that focus.  The level of\
    \ redirection\n   that exists today between 802 variables and MIB objects might\
    \ be\n   useful for the transition process when 802.1 management variable\n  \
    \ semantics are changed and MIB objects are supplemented.\n   The existing Bridge\
    \ documents represent the current state of bridging\n   management, and the documents\
    \ contain compliance clauses describing\n   the current requirements to be compliant\
    \ to the IETF standards.  As\n   the IEEE develops addition MIB modules, new compliance\
    \ clauses will\n   define the new \"state of the art\", without needing to obsolete\
    \ the\n   old MIB objects or the old compliance clauses.  Therefore, the plan\n\
    \   is that the current Bridge MIB modules will be \"frozen in time\", and\n \
    \  updated only via the development of independent MIB modules by the\n   802.1\
    \ WG.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  Introduction\n   The leaders of the Bridge MIB WG, 802.1 WG, IETF O&M area,\
    \ and IEEE\n   802 project have discussed having IETF MIB Doctors review IEEE\
    \ 802\n   developed MIB modules.  This is a loose offering.\n   The expectation\
    \ is that IETF will maintain a group of MIB Doctors who\n   can review IEEE 802\
    \ - developed MIB modules, when a MIB Doctor is\n   available and willing to do\
    \ such review.  It is the choice of\n   individual MIB Doctors to provide technical\
    \ advice and MIB Doctor\n   reviews, and it is the willingness of the 802.1 editors\
    \ and the\n   support of the 802.1 chairs that determine whether the advice is\n\
    \   accepted.  This is not as formalized as it is in the IETF.\n   In the IETF,\
    \ the O&M area directors get \"pushed\" by other area\n   directors to have MIB\
    \ module documents reviewed by MIB Doctors when\n   they start to come to WG Last\
    \ Call, IETF Last Call, and certainly no\n   later than when they appear on the\
    \ IESG agenda.  This demand requires\n   prioritization of requests for MIB Doctor\
    \ reviews by the area\n   directors and prioritization by MIB Doctors when deciding\
    \ whether to\n   accept a request to review documents.\n   When there are many\
    \ IETF MIB documents in the queue and an IEEE MIB\n   module document comes along\
    \ for review, it will be the choice of the\n   individual MIB Doctors whether\

- title: 5.2.  Review Guidelines
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Review Guidelines\n   The IETF has developed Guidelines for Authors and\
    \ Reviewers of MIB\n   Documents [RFC4181] so that authors and other WG members\
    \ can check\n   their document against the guidelines before requesting a MIB\
    \ Doctor\n   review.  The 802.1 WG editor should use the RFC4181 guidelines before\n\
    \   requesting a MIB Doctor review.\n   RFC4181 also intended to help editors\
    \ by guiding MIB Doctors, so\n   reviews by different MIB Doctors will remain\
    \ fairly consistent.  Each\n   MIB Doctor has his or her own \"pet peeves\", and\
    \ RFC4181 can help an\n   editor know whether a review point is based on the consensus\
    \ of the\n   MIB Doctors, or on a pet peeve.\n   Many SMI constraints, IETF editing\
    \ constraints, and best current\n   practices are discussed in RFC4181.  However,\
    \ many aspects of good\n   MIB design (e.g., table fate-sharing, good index choices)\
    \ are more\n   art than science and are not discussed in the guidelines.  Those\n\
    \   might be more useful to other SDOs (and IETF editors) than guidelines\n  \
    \ relating to IETF boilerplate requirements.  The MIB Doctors have\n   discussed\
    \ starting a design guidelines document.\n   RFC4181 was used for reviewing the\
    \ 802.1AB [IEEE802.1AB] and 802.1AE\n   [IEEE802.1AE] documents.  During those\
    \ reviews, there were some\n   anomalies about the IEEE use of the guidelines\
    \ that we need to\n   evaluate further.\n   For example, in the IETF boilerplates,\
    \ some of the terms have\n   different meanings in IETF and IEEE, and different\
    \ editing style\n   guidelines are being used by the different bodies.  It would\
    \ be good\n   to develop an 802 MIB boilerplate that is consistent with the IETF\n\
    \   boilerplate, in purpose if not in terminology.\n   The IETF uses [RFC4181]\
    \ as a reference document for IETF documents\n   containing MIB modules.  It is\
    \ recommended that in time IEEE 802.1 WG\n   develop its own guidelines for IEEE\
    \ MIB modules review.  Until this\n   happens, Section 3 (General Documentation\
    \ Guidelines) and Section 4\n   (SMIv2 Guidelines) in RFC4181 can be used, with\
    \ the following\n   exceptions and modifications:\n   o  In the introductory paragraphs\
    \ of Section 3, the list of sections\n      that must be included in a MIB document\
    \ should be adapted to the\n      IEEE needs and style guide.\n   o  Sections\
    \ 3.1 through 3.4 apply as in the IETF document, with the\n      mention that\
    \ the IETF boilerplate could be edited to comply to the\n      IEEE needs and\
    \ style guide.\n   o  Section 3.5 (IANA Considerations) does not apply but may\
    \ be\n      replaced by a section with IEEE recommendations on naming and OID\n\
    \      space assignments.\n   o  Sections 3.6 does not apply.\n   o  Section 3.7\
    \ (Copyright Notices) does not apply and may be replaced\n      with text corresponding\
    \ to the IEEE copyright rules.  The\n      exception is the case where a document\
    \ was originally issued by\n      the IETF, and then taken over by the IEEE, in\
    \ which case, unless\n      the document authors agree otherwise, notices concerning\
    \ the IETF\n      copyrights (as described in Section 3.7) and IEEE copyrights\
    \ must\n      be included.\n   o  Section 3.8 (Intellectual Property) does not\
    \ apply and may be\n      replaced with a notice reflecting the intellectual property\
    \ rules\n      of the IEEE.\n   o  Sections 4.1 and 4.2 apply as in the IETF document.\n\
    \   o  Section 4.3 (Naming Hierarchy) applies with changes related to the\n  \
    \    OID root of the IEEE 802.1 MIB modules.\n   o  Sections 4.4 to 4.8 apply\
    \ as in the IETF document\n   o  Section 4.9 applies, but some interesting problems\
    \ may arise if\n      IETF-designed modules are being taken over and continued\
    \ by the\n      IEEE.  In order to comply to the requirement, the IEEE should\n\
    \      continue to work and maintain the MIB module in the IETF OID\n      space.\n\
    \   An IETF MIB document template that contains all the required\n   sections,\
    \ following RFC Editor guidelines and the MIB review\n   guidelines, is under\
    \ development to help editors get started\n   developing a MIB module document.\
    \  The template will help MIB Doctors\n   check new MIB modules more efficiently\
    \ by providing the most up-to-\n   date MIB module boilerplate, with sections\
    \ in the preferred order,\n   suggestions for what to include in certain sections,\
    \ and the\n   references required to support boilerplate text.  It is recommended\n\
    \   that the IEEE 802.1 WG establish a comparable template, following the\n  \
    \ IEEE editing guidelines and the RFC4181 guidelines, where\n   appropriate.\n\
    \   Such an IEEE template could simply be the management clause of an\n   802.1\
    \ document, to be filled in with technology-specific information.\n   In 802.1AB,\
    \ the MIB clause was restructured to include modified IETF\n   boilerplates and\
    \ security considerations.  This might be a good start\n   on such an IEEE template.\
    \  It would be helpful to MIB Doctors and\n   editors if the unmodified template\
    \ was available in ASCII format for\n   automated comparison to a document in\
    \ development, to verify that the\n   appropriate boilerplate text is being used.\n\
    \   When the 802.1 WG creates a PAR for 802.1 Bridge MIB maintenance, the\n  \
    \ creation of such a template might be included in the PAR.\n   The IETF MIB documents\
    \ include the following text relative to the\n   Internet Management Framework\
    \ as part of the standard boilerplate:\n      For a detailed overview of the documents\
    \ that describe the current\n      Internet-Standard Management Framework, please\
    \ refer to Section 7\n      of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n      Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store,\n      termed the Management Information\
    \ Base, or MIB.  MIB objects are\n      generally accessed through the Simple\
    \ Network Management Protocol\n      (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using\
    \ the mechanisms\n      defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).\
    \  This\n      memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which\n\
    \      is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579\n      [RFC2579],\
    \ and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].\n   It is recommended that the IEEE 802.1 standards\
    \ that contain MIB\n   modules include a similar sub-section in the MIB section\
    \ of the IEEE\n   document, and the appropriate references in their reference\
    \ section.\n   If IEEE 802.1 WG wants to craft its own guidelines, based on RFC4181,\n\
    \   it will need to get the author's permission.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Review Format
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Review Format\n   The 802.1 WG uses a template for comments, in the following\
    \ format,\n   so the onus to provide new text is on the reviewer, not on the\n\
    \   editor.\n   NAME:\n   COMMENT TYPE:\n         [E=Editorial, ER=Editorial Required]\n\

    \ CHANGES END:\n   MIB Doctor reviews in the IETF are typically done in simple\
    \ text\n   email and often contain a long list of review comments.  MIB Doctor\n\
    \   reviews sometimes raise a general design issue rather than an issue\n   with\
    \ specific text, and some MIB Doctor comments refer to \"global\"\n   problems,\
    \ such as many objects that do not specify persistence\n   requirements.\n   For\
    \ global problems, IETF MIB Doctors are not required to provide the\n   replacement\
    \ text for each of these instances when doing 802.1 MIB\n   module reviews.  For\
    \ example, if the naming of objects does not\n   follow recommended conventions\
    \ throughout the document, the MIB\n   Doctor can point out the relevant clause\
    \ in RFC4181 without\n   suggesting each replacement object name.  This is an\
    \ important\n   concession to the IETF MIB Doctors, to better suit the nature\
    \ of\n   their reviews, even though this puts the onus on the editor to fix\n\
    \   the problem without explicit suggested changes.\n   During the transition,\
    \ the chair and vice-chair of the 802.1 WG are\n   willing to accept simple emails,\
    \ as long as they give enough\n   information to understand what the problem is\
    \ and how to fix it.  The\n   comments should include a problem description, a\
    \ suggested\n   resolution, and a page and line number.  It would be helpful if\n\
    \   comments are submitted in the preferred format, since this makes it\n   easier\
    \ for the editor to understand exactly what is being requested,\n   to log the\
    \ comment for review, and to review the comment in the\n   meeting environment.\
    \  The majority of MIB comments can usually be\n   handled outside the official\
    \ balloting process.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Review Weight
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Review Weight\n   In the IETF, MIB Doctor review happens as part of the\
    \ process of\n   approving a standard.  When a document is submitted to the IESG\
    \ for\n   approval as a standard, the area director/IESG requests a MIB Doctor\n\
    \   review.  Failure to pass the review can stop forward progress of a\n   document\
    \ in the standardization process at the discretion of the area\n   director. \
    \ MIB Doctors take their role seriously and perform detailed\n   reviews.\n  \
    \ In the IEEE, the board that approves a standard is separate from the\n   802.1\
    \ WG, and the reviews MIB Doctors will do according to this\n   transition plan\
    \ are done within the 802.1 WG.  So a MIB Doctor review\n   in the 802.1 WG is\
    \ akin to an IETF WG chair asking for a MIB Doctor\n   to sanity-check the work,\
    \ rather than to a formal \"MIB Doctor\n   review\".\n   Formally, comments from\
    \ any origin carry the same weight in 802.1;\n   even voting status in the WG\
    \ doesn't make one's comments more weighty\n   than those of a non-voter.  The\
    \ 802.1 WG is not permitted to ignore\n   any comments, regardless of origin.\
    \  Serious comments are always\n   taken seriously and never ignored.\n   The\
    \ IEEE typically requires that comments be officially submitted in\n   a specific\
    \ format, including proposed replacement text, which is then\n   reviewed at the\
    \ meetings, and the decisions are documented in\n   disposition documents.  These\
    \ comments and dispositions are available\n   from the 802.1 private website.\
    \  IETF participants can be given the\n   password to the website by the 802.1\
    \ WG chair, so that they can see\n   previous and current comments and dispositions.\n\
    \   We should not give the impression that the IEEE documents have\n   received\
    \ the organized, coordinated, and formalized MIB Doctor review\n   as done in\
    \ the IETF, if such review is done on an ad hoc basis, and\n   not necessarily\
    \ as part of the advancement process.  We need to be\n   clear what is said, because\
    \ the phrase \"This document has passed MIB\n   Doctor review\" has quite some\
    \ weight in the IETF.  We need to clarify\n   whether to describe the reviews\
    \ done as having been done by an \"IETF\n   MIB Doctor\" or \"IEEE 802 MIB Doctor\"\
    , or by a generic \"MIB Doctor\".\n   MIB Doctor reviews be copied to the document\
    \ editor, and to the 802.1\n   chair.\n"

  contents:
  - "9.  Intellectual Property Considerations\n   On November 29, 2005, a teleconference\
    \ was held that included Jorge\n   Contreras, Scott Bradner, Bernard Aboba, Bert\
    \ Wijnen, and David\n   Harrington, to discuss the Intellectual Property Issues.\
    \  The\n   following is a summary of the conclusions:\n   The IETF/ISOC gets a\
    \ non-exclusive copyright license from RFC authors\n   so that the IETF can publish\
    \ RFCs, let third parties translate RFCs\n   into other languages, let third parties\
    \ reproduce RFCs as-is and\n   create derivative works within the IETF standard\
    \ process.  The\n   author(s) retain all of their rights other than the right\
    \ to withdraw\n   the permission for the IETF to do the above.\n   If anyone (including\
    \ the IEEE) wants to reproduce any RFC as-is, he\n   or she can do so without\
    \ any specific permission, but it has to be\n   \"as-is\" (and that includes the\
    \ ISOC copyright notice) since the right\n   for third parties to reproduce RFCs\
    \ is part of the rights the IETF\n   gets from the author(s).\n   The author(s)\
    \ of a RFC can tell another group (e.g., the IEEE) that\n   the other group can\
    \ produce its own versions of the RFC, since the\n   IETF does not get from the\
    \ author(s) the right to stop them from\n   doing so.\n   If the author(s) give\
    \ another group the permission to create\n   derivative works, this has nothing\
    \ (legally) to do with the IETF,\n   since the agreement is just between the author(s)\
    \ and the other\n   group.  Because of that, there is no reason for an ISOC copyright\
    \ to\n   appear, since the new document is not an IETF document.  It would be\n\
    \   nice if the other group were to include a note to say that their\n   document\
    \ is based on RFC XXXX, and the authors can insist on that if\n   they want to,\
    \ but the IETF has no formal role in granting\n   permissions, so the IETF cannot\
    \ require the pointer to the RFC.\n   There is a desire to ensure that the IETF\
    \ has sufficient rights to do\n   derivatives of its own works.  If the IETF decides,\
    \ as part of a\n   liaison arrangement with another SDO, to hand over maintenance\
    \ of a\n   specification to them, and if the authors give the other SDO\n   permission\
    \ to create derivative works, the IETF still retains the\n   permission granted\
    \ by the authors to create derivative works within\n   the IETF standard process.\n\
    \   The IETF strongly recommends that any derivative works developed by\n   another\
    \ standards body DO acknowledge that the work builds on prior\n   IETF work, with\
    \ reference to the RFC(s) the work derives from.  MIB\n   modules compliant to\
    \ the IETF Best Current Practices documented in\n   RFC4181 contain REVISION clauses\
    \ that document how/where earlier\n   versions were published.\n   On January\
    \ 11, 2006, another teleconference was held, to review the\n   legal issues with\
    \ Claudio M. Stanziola, the IEEE Standards\n   Association Manager of Standards\
    \ Intellectual Property.  As a result\n   of that discussion, the IETF Legal Counsel\
    \ on IPR matters has crafted\n   a sample document that other SDOs may use as\
    \ a guideline for\n   producing their own documents on \"how to ask the question\"\
    \ to solicit\n   authors' permissions.  The template is included in this document\
    \ in\n   Appendix B.\n"
