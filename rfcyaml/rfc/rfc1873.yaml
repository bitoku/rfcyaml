    \   This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\n   community.\
    \  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any\n   kind.  Discussion\
    \ and suggestions for improvement are requested.\n   Distribution of this memo\
    \ is unlimited.\nAbstract\n   When using MIME [MIME] to encapsulate a structured\
    \ object that\n   consist of many elements, for example an SGML [SGML] document,\
    \ a\n   single element may occur several times.  An encapsulation normally\n \
    \  maps each of the structured objects elements to a MIME entity.  It is\n   useful\
    \ to include elements that occur multiple time exactly once.  To\n   accomplish\
    \ that and to preserve the object structure it is desirable\n   to unambiguously\
    \ refer to another body part of the same message.\n   The existing MIME Content-Type\
    \ Message/External-Body access-types\n   allow a MIME entity (body-part) to refer\
    \ to an object that is not in\n   the message by specifying how to access that\
    \ object.  The Content-ID\n   access method described in this document provides\
    \ the capability to\n   refer to an object within the message.\n1. Introduction\n\
    \   Consider a MIME multipart entity several of whose body parts contain\n   the\
    \ same data (body) but different parameters or Content-* headers.\n   Representing\
    \ those body parts without duplicating the data in each\n   one promotes efficient\
    \ use of resources (bandwidth and storage\n   space).  To achieve these benefits\
    \ an access-type is defined that\n   permits one message part to refer to another\
    \ one in the same message.\n2. The Content-ID Access Type\n2.1 Registration Information\n\
    \       MIME access-type name:   content-id\n       Required parameters:     none\n\
    \       Optional parameters:     none\n       Published specification: this document\n\

    \             Ed Levinson <ELevinson@accurate.com>\n       Additional requirements:\n\
    \       The content-id header of the access-type=content-id MIME\n       entity\
    \ must match (be identical to) exactly one content-id\n       in the same message,\
    \ excluding other access-type=content-id\n       entities.  Thus, the content-id\
    \ access type can only occur\n       within a multipart message and can refer\
    \ to another body\n       part anywhere in the same message.\n       A MIME User\
    \ Agent (MUA) constructs the resultant MIME body\n       part as described below.\
    \  We call the access-type=content-id\n       MIME entity the referring body part\
    \ and the MIME body part\n       to which it refers, the one with the matching\
    \ content-id,\n       the referenced body part.  The MIME entity that results\
    \ from\n       content-id access type consists of:\n   (a) the referenced body\
    \ part's content-type header,\n   (b) the referring body part's headers except\
    \ its content-type\n       header,\n   (c) any headers in the referenced body\
    \ part not in the referring\n       one,\n   (d)  the line separating the headers\
    \ from the body, and\n   (e)  the referenced body part's body.\n2.2 Example Usage\n\
    \   The following example shows a message that consists of two identical\n   images.\n\
    \            MIME-Version: 1.0\n            Content-Type: Multipart/Mixed;\n \
    \              boundary=tiger-lily\n            --tiger-lily\n            Content-Type:\
    \ image/jpeg\n            Content-ID: <950323.1552@XIson.com>\n            AAAcdb...\n\
    \            --tiger-lily\n            Content-type: Message/External-Body;\n\
    \               access-type=content-id\n            Content-ID: <950323.1552@XIson.com>\n\
    \            Content-Description:\n               This body part is duplicated\
    \ by reference\n            --tiger-lily--\n       The equivalent MIME entity\
    \ for the second body part is:\n            --tiger-lily\n            Content-Type:\
    \ image/jpeg\n            Content-ID: <950323.1552@XIson.com>\n            Content-Description:\n\
    \               This body part is duplicated by reference\n            AAAcdb...\n\
    \            --tiger-lily\n3. Security Considerations\n   The content-id access-type\
    \ does not impact the security of messages\n   or systems.  The referenced MIME\
    \ entity may have security\n   implications.\n4. References\n   [822]       Crocker,\
