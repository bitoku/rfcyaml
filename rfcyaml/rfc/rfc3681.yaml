- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document discusses the need for delegation of the\n   E.F.F.3.IP6.ARPA\
    \ DNS zone in order to enable reverse lookups for\n   6bone addresses, and makes\
    \ specific recommendations for the process\n   needed to accomplish this.\n"
- title: 1.  6bone and DNS
  contents:
  - "1.  6bone and DNS\n   The 6bone, whose address space was allocated by [RFC2471],\
    \ has\n   provided a network for IPv6 experimentation for numerous purposes for\n\
    \   seven years.  Up to the present time, reverse lookups for 6bone\n   addresses\
    \ have been accomplished through IP6.INT.  It is now\n   important that the thousands\
    \ of 6bone users be able to update their\n   IPv6 software to use IP6.ARPA [RFC3152].\n\
    \   Although the 6bone has a limited life, as a phaseout plan is being\n   discussed\
    \ at the IETF at this time [I-D.fink-6bone-phaseout], there\n   is likely to be\
    \ 2.5 to 3.5 more years of operation.  During this\n   remaining 6bone lifetime\
    \ IP6.ARPA reverse lookup services for the\n   3ffe::/16 address space are required.\n\
    \   Discussions have been underway between the 6bone and RIR communities,\n  \
    \ about having the RIRs perform this service.  It was agreed at the San\n   Francisco\
    \ IETF meeting in March 2003 that it was more practical for\n   the 6bone to provide\
    \ this service for itself.  This would relieve the\n   RIRs of the costs of providing\
    \ this service, yet still provide the\n   IP6.ARPA authority the ability to terminate\
    \ the service when the\n   planned 6bone termination date is reached (currently\
    \ anticipated to\n   be June 6, 2006).\n   The current planning within the 6bone\
    \ operational community is to\n   provide new inet6num attributes in the 6bone\
    \ registry database for\n   top level 6bone address space holders to request delegation\
    \ to their\n   reverse path servers.\n"
- title: 2.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   This memo requests that the IANA delegate the E.F.F.3.IP6.ARPA\
    \ domain\n   to the 6bone, as will be described in instructions to be provided\
    \ by\n   the IAB.  Names within this zone are to be further delegated within\n\
    \   the top level 6bone ISPs (known as pTLAs) in accordance with the\n   delegation\
    \ of 6bone 3FFE::/16 address space.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   While DNS spoofing of address to name mapping\
    \ has been exploited in\n   IPv4, delegation of the E.F.F.3.IP6.ARPA zone creates\
    \ no new threats\n   to the security of the internet.\n"
