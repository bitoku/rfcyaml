  contents:
  - "1.3.  Rationale for CDN Interconnection\n   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)\
    \ are used to deliver content because\n   they can:\n   o  improve the experience\
    \ for the End User; for instance delivery has\n      lower latency (decreased\
    \ round-trip-time and higher throughput\n      between the user and the delivery\
    \ server) and better robustness\n      (ability to use multiple delivery servers),\n\
    \   o  reduce the network operator's costs; for instance, lower delivery\n   \
    \   cost (reduced bandwidth usage) for cacheable content,\n   o  reduce the Content\
    \ Service Provider's (CSP) internal\n      infrastructure costs, such as data\
    \ center capacity, space, and\n      electricity consumption, as popular content\
    \ is delivered\n      externally through the CDN rather than through the CSP's\
    \ own\n      servers.\n   Indeed, many Network Service Providers (NSPs) and Enterprise\
    \ Service\n   Providers are deploying or have deployed their own CDNs.  Despite\
    \ the\n   potential benefits of interconnecting CDNs, today each CDN is a\n  \
    \ stand-alone network.  The objective of CDN Interconnection is to\n   overcome\
    \ this restriction; the interconnected CDNs should be able to\n   collectively\
    \ behave as a single delivery infrastructure.\n   An example is depicted in Figure\
    \ 1, where two CDN Providers establish\n   a CDN Interconnection.  The Content\
    \ Service Provider CSP-1 reaches an\n   agreement with CDN Provider 'A' for the\
    \ delivery of its content.\n   Independently, CDN Provider 'A' and CDN Provider\
    \ 'B' agree to\n   interconnect their CDNs.\n   When a given User Agent requests\
    \ content from CSP-1, CDN-A may\n   consider that delivery by CDN-B is appropriate,\
    \ for instance, because\n   CDN-B is an Access CDN and the user is directly attached\
    \ to it.\n   Through the CDN Interconnection arrangements put in place between\n\
    \   CDN-A and CDN-B (as a result of the CDN Interconnection agreement\n   established\
    \ between CDN Provider 'A' and CDN Provider 'B'), CDN-A can\n   redirect the request\
    \ to CDN-B and the content is actually delivered\n   to the User Agent by CDN-B.\n\
    \   The End User benefits from this arrangement through a better Quality\n   of\
    \ Experience (QoE, see [RFC6390]), because the content is delivered\n   from a\
    \ nearby Surrogate (e.g., lower latency, bottlenecks avoided).\n   CDN Provider\
    \ 'A' benefits because it does not need to deploy such an\n   extensive CDN, while\
    \ CDN Provider 'B' may receive some compensation\n   for the delivery.  CSP-1\
    \ benefits because it only needs to make one\n   business agreement and one technical\
    \ arrangement with CDN Provider\n   'A', but its End Users get a service quality\
    \ as though CSP-1 had also\n   gone to the trouble of making a business agreement\
    \ and technical\n   arrangement with CDN Provider 'B'.\n    +-------+ +-------+\n\

    \ the example, another Content Service Provider, CSP-2, may\n   also reach an\
    \ agreement with CDN Provider 'A'.  However, CSP-2 may\n   not want its content\
    \ to be distributed by CDN Provider B; for\n   example, CSP-2 may not want to\
    \ distribute its content in the area\n   where CDN Provider 'B' operates.  This\
    \ example illustrates that\n   policy considerations are an important part of\
    \ CDNI.\n"
- title: 2.  Footprint Extension Use Cases
  contents:
  - "2.  Footprint Extension Use Cases\n   Footprint extension is expected to be a\
    \ major use case for CDN\n   Interconnection.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Geographic Extension
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Geographic Extension\n   In this use case, the CDN Provider wants to extend\
    \ the geographic\n   distribution that it can offer to its CSPs:\n   o  without\
    \ compromising the quality of delivery.\n   o  without incurring additional transit\
    \ and other network costs that\n      would result from serving content from geographically\
    \ or\n      topologically remote Surrogates.\n   o  without incurring the cost\
    \ of deploying and operating Surrogates\n      and the associated CDN infrastructure\
    \ that may not be justified in\n      the corresponding geographic region (e.g.,\
    \ because of relatively\n      low delivery volume, or conversely because of the\
    \ high investments\n      that would be needed to satisfy the high volume).\n\
    \   If there are several CDN Providers that have a geographically limited\n  \
    \ footprint (e.g., restricted to one country), or do not serve all End\n   Users\
    \ in a geographic area, then interconnecting their CDNs enables\n   these CDN\
    \ Providers to provide their services beyond their own\n   footprint.\n   As an\
    \ example, suppose a French CSP wants to distribute its TV\n   programs to End\
    \ Users located in France and various countries in\n   North Africa.  It asks\
    \ a French CDN Provider to deliver the content.\n   The French CDN Provider's\
    \ network only covers France, so it makes an\n   agreement with another CDN Provider\
    \ that covers North Africa.\n   Overall, from the CSP's perspective, the French\
    \ CDN Provider provides\n   a CDN service for both France and North Africa.\n\
    \   In addition to video, this use case applies to other types of content\n  \
    \ such as automatic software updates (browser updates, operating system\n   patches,\
    \ virus database update, etc.).\n"
- title: 2.2.  Inter-Affiliates Interconnection
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Inter-Affiliates Interconnection\n   The previous section describes the\
    \ case of geographic extension\n   between CDNs operated by different entities.\
    \  A large CDN Provider\n   may have several subsidiaries that each operate their\
    \ own CDN (which\n   may rely on different CDN technologies, see Section 4.2).\
    \  In certain\n   circumstances, the CDN Provider needs to make these CDNs interoperate\n\
    \   to provide consistent service to its customers on the whole\n   collective\
    \ footprint.\n"
- title: 2.3.  ISP Handling of Third-Party Content
  contents:
  - "2.3.  ISP Handling of Third-Party Content\n   Consider an ISP carrying to its\
    \ subscribers a lot of content that\n   comes from a third-party CSP and that\
    \ is injected into the ISP's\n   network by an Authoritative CDN Provider.  There\
    \ are mutual benefits\n   to the ISP (acting as an Access CDN), the Authoritative\
    \ CDN, and the\n   CSP that would make a case for establishing a CDNI agreement.\
    \  For\n   example:\n   o  allowing the CSP to offer improved QoE and QoE services\
    \ to\n      subscribers, for example, reduced content startup time or\n      increased\
    \ video quality and resolution of adaptive streaming\n      content.\n   o  allowing\
    \ the Authoritative CDN to reduce hardware capacity and\n      footprint, by using\
    \ the ISP caching and delivery capacity.\n   o  allowing the ISP to reduce traffic\
    \ load on some segments of the\n      network by caching inside of the ISP network.\n\
    \   o  allowing the ISP to influence and/or control the traffic ingress\n    \
    \  points.\n   o  allowing the ISP to derive some incremental revenue for transport\n\
    \      of the traffic and to monetize QoE services.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Nomadic Users
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Nomadic Users\n   In this scenario, a CSP wishes to allow End Users who\
    \ move between\n   access networks to continue to access their content.  The motivation\n\
    \   of this case is to allow nomadic End Users to maintain access to\n   content\
    \ with a consistent QoE across a range of devices and/or\n   geographic regions.\n\
    \   This use case covers situations like:\n   o  End Users moving between different\
    \ access networks, which may be\n      located within the same geographic region\
    \ or different geographic\n      regions.\n   o  End Users switching between different\
    \ devices or delivery\n      technologies, as discussed in Section 4.\n   Consider\

    \  Ordinarily, when End User A accesses content via\n   ISP A (her \"home ISP\"\
    ), the content is delivered from CDN-A, which in\n   this example is within ISP\
    \ A's network.\n   However, while End User A is not connected to ISP A's network,\
    \ for\n   example, because it is connected to a WiFi provider or mobile\n   network,\
    \ End User A can also access the same content.  In this case,\n   End User A may\
    \ benefit from accessing the same content delivered by\n   an alternate CDN (CDN-B),\

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Overload Handling and Dimensioning\n   A CDN is likely to be dimensioned\
    \ to support an expected maximum\n   traffic load.  However, unexpected spikes\
    \ in content popularity\n   (flash crowd) may drive load beyond the expected peak.\
    \  The prime\n   recurrent time peaks of content distribution may differ between\
    \ two\n   CDNs.  Taking advantage of the different traffic peak times, a CDN\n\
    \   may interconnect with another CDN to increase its effective capacity\n   during\
    \ the peak of traffic.  This brings dimensioning savings to the\n   CDNs, as they\
    \ can use each other's resources during their respective\n   peaks of activity.\n\
    \   Offload also applies to planned situations in which a CDN Provider\n   needs\
    \ CDN capacity in a particular region during a short period of\n   time.  For\
    \ example, a CDN can offload traffic to another CDN for the\n   duration of a\
    \ specific maintenance operation or for the distribution\n   of a special event,\
    \ as in the scenario depicted in Figure 3.  For\n   instance, consider a TV channel\
    \ that is the distributor for a major\n   event, such as a celebrity's wedding\
    \ or a major sport competition,\n   and this TV channel has contracted particular\
    \ CDNs for the delivery.\n   The CDNs (CDN-A and CDN-B) that the TV channel uses\
    \ for delivering\n   the content related to this event are likely to experience\
    \ a flash\n   crowd during the event and will need to offload traffic, while other\n\
    \   CDNs (CDN-C) will support a more typical traffic load and be able to\n   handle\
    \ the offloaded traffic.\n   In this use case, the Delivering CDN on which requests\
    \ are offloaded\n   should be able to handle the offloaded requests.  Therefore,\
    \ the uCDN\n   might require information on the dCDNs to be aware of the amount\

    \ be able to guarantee service continuity\n   during partial failures (e.g., failure\
    \ of some Surrogates).  In\n   partial failure scenarios, a CDN Provider has at\
    \ least three options:\n   1.  if possible, use internal mechanisms to redirect\
    \ traffic onto\n       surviving equipment,\n   2.  depending on traffic management\

    \   The ability to support content acquisition resiliency is an important\n  \

    \ be better equipped\n   to both distribute load between origin servers and attempt\
    \ content\n   acquisition from alternate content sources when acquisition failures\n\
    \   occur.  When normal content acquisition fails, a CDN may need to try\n   other\
    \ content source options, for example:\n   o  an upstream CDN may acquire content\
    \ from an alternate CSP origin\n      server,\n   o  a downstream CDN may acquire\
    \ content from an alternate Surrogate\n      within an upstream CDN,\n   o  a\
    \ downstream CDN may acquire content from an alternate upstream\n      CDN, or\n\
    \   o  a downstream CDN may acquire content directly from the CSP's\n      origin\
    \ server.\n   Though content acquisition protocols are beyond the scope of CDNI,\n\
    \   the selection of content acquisition sources should be considered and\n  \
    \ facilitated.\n"

  - "4.1.  Device and Network Technology Extension\n   In this use case, the CDN Provider\
    \ may have the right geographic\n   footprint, but may wish to extend the supported\
    \ range of devices and\n   User Agents or the supported range of delivery technologies.\
    \  In this\n   case, a CDN Provider may interconnect with a CDN that offers services\n\
    \   that:\n   o  the CDN Provider is not willing to provide, or\n   o  its own\
    \ CDN is not able to support.\n   The following examples illustrate this use case:\n\
    \   1.  CDN-A cannot support a specific delivery protocol.  For instance,\n  \
    \     CDN-A may interconnect with CDN-B to serve a proportion of its\n       traffic\
    \ that requires HTTPS [RFC2818].  CDN-A may use CDN-B's\n       footprint (which\
    \ may overlap with its own) to deliver HTTPS\n       without needing to deploy\
    \ its own infrastructure.  This case\n       could also be true of other formats,\
    \ delivery protocols (e.g.,\n       the Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP), the\
    \ Real Time Streaming\n       Protocol (RTSP), etc.), and features (specific forms\
    \ of\n       authorization such as tokens, per session encryption, etc.).\n  \
    \ 2.  CDN-A has a footprint covering traditional fixed-line broadband\n      \
    \ and wants to extend coverage to mobile devices.  In this case,\n       CDN-A\
    \ may contract and interconnect with CDN-B, who has both:\n       *  a physical\
    \ footprint inside the mobile network,\n       *  the ability to deliver content\
    \ over a protocol that is\n          required by specific mobile devices.\n  \
    \ 3.  CDN-A only supports IPv4 within its infrastructure but wants to\n      \
    \ deliver content over IPv6.  CDN-B supports both IPv4 and IPv6\n       within\
    \ its infrastructure.  CDN-A interconnects with CDN-B to\n       serve out its\
    \ content over native IPv6 connections.\n   These cases can apply to many CDN\
    \ features that a given CDN Provider\n   may not be able to support or not be\
    \ willing to invest in, and thus,\n   that the CDN Provider would delegate to\
    \ another CDN.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Technology and Vendor Interoperability
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Technology and Vendor Interoperability\n   A CDN Provider may deploy a\
    \ new CDN to run alongside its existing CDN\n   as a simple way of migrating its\
    \ CDN service to a new technology.  In\n   addition, a CDN Provider may have a\
    \ multi-vendor strategy for its CDN\n   deployment.  Finally, a CDN Provider may\
    \ want to deploy a separate\n   CDN for a particular CSP or a specific network.\
    \  In all these\n   circumstances, CDNI benefits the CDN Provider, as it simplifies\
    \ or\n   automates some inter-CDN operations (e.g., migrating the request\n  \
    \ routing function progressively).\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3.  QoE and QoS Improvement\n   Some CSPs are willing to pay a premium for\
    \ enhanced delivery of\n   content to their End Users.  In some cases, even if\
    \ the CDN Provider\n   could deliver the content to the End Users, it would not\
    \ meet the\n   CSP's service-level requirements.  As a result, the CDN Provider\
    \ may\n   establish a CDN Interconnection agreement with another CDN Provider\n\
    \   that can provide the expected QoE to the End User, e.g., via an\n   Access\
    \ CDN that is able to deliver content from Surrogates located\n   closer to the\
    \ End User and with the required service level.\n"
- title: 5.  Enforcement of Content Delivery Policy
  contents:
  - "5.  Enforcement of Content Delivery Policy\n   An important aspect common to\
    \ all the above use cases is that CSPs\n   typically want to enforce content delivery\
    \ policies.  A CSP may want\n   to define content delivery policies that specify\
    \ when, how, and/or to\n   whom the CDN delivers content.  These policies apply\
    \ to all\n   interconnected CDNs (uCDNs and dCDNs) in the same or similar way\
    \ that\n   a CSP can define content delivery policies for content delivered by\
    \ a\n   single, non-interconnected CDN.  Appendix A provides examples of CSP-\n\
    \   defined policies.\n"

- title: A.1.  Content Delivery Policy Enforcement
  contents:
  - "A.1.  Content Delivery Policy Enforcement\n   The content distribution policies\
    \ that a CSP attaches to a content\n   asset may depend on many criteria.  For\
    \ instance, distribution\n   policies for audiovisual content often combine constraints\
    \ of varying\n   levels of complexity and sophistication, for example:\n   o \
    \ temporal constraints (e.g., available for 24 hours, available 28\n      days\
    \ after DVD release, etc.),\n   o  user agent platform constraints (e.g., mobile\
    \ device platforms,\n      desktop computer platforms, set-top-box platforms,\
    \ etc.),\n   o  resolution-based constraints (e.g., high definition vs. standard\n\
    \      definition encodings),\n   o  user agent identification or authorization,\n\
    \   o  access network constraints (e.g., per NSP), and\n   o  IP geo-blocking\
    \ constraints (e.g., for a given coverage area).\n   CSPs may use sophisticated\
    \ policies in accordance with their business\n   model.  However, the enforcement\
    \ of those policies does not\n   necessarily require that the delivery network\
    \ understand the policy\n   rationales or how policies apply to specific content\
    \ assets.  Content\n   delivery policies may be distilled into simple rules that\
    \ can be\n   commonly enforced across all dCDNs.  These rules may influence dCDN\n\
    \   delegation and Surrogate selection decisions, for instance, to ensure\n  \
    \ that the specific rules (e.g., time-window, geo-blocking, pre-\n   authorization\
    \ validation) can indeed be enforced by the Delivering\n   CDN.  In turn, this\
    \ can guarantee to the CSP that content delivery\n   policies are properly applied.\n\

    \   for delivery of their content, especially in the case where a secured\n  \
    \ content transmission is required (e.g., must use HTTPS).  CSPs may\n   also\

- title: A.3.  Branding
  contents:
  - "A.3.  Branding\n   Preserving the branding of the CSP throughout delivery is\
    \ often\n   important to the CSP.  CSPs may desire to offer content services\n\
    \   under their own name, even when the associated CDN service involves\n   other\
    \ CDN Providers.  For instance, a CSP may desire to ensure that\n   content is\
    \ delivered with URIs appearing to the End Users under the\n   CSP's own domain\
    \ name, even when the content delivery involves\n   separate CDN Providers.  The\
    \ CSP may wish to prevent the delivery of\n   its content by specific dCDNs that\
    \ lack support for such branding\n   preservation features.\n   Analogous cases\
    \ exist when the uCDN wants to offer CDN services under\n   its own branding even\
    \ if dCDNs are involved, and so it restricts the\n   delivery delegation to a\
    \ chain that preserves its brand visibility.\n"
