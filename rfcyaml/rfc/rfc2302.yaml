    \   section as background information, the reader is directed to the\n   original\
    \ TIFF specification [TIFF] to obtain complete feature and\n   technical details.\n\
    \ 2.1 TIFF Scope\n   TIFF describes image data that typically comes from scanners,\
    \ frame\n   grabbers, and paint- and photo-retouching programs. TIFF is not a\n\
    \   printer language or page description language. The purpose of TIFF is\n  \
    \ to describe and store raster image data.  A primary goal of TIFF is\n   to provide\
    \ a rich environment within which applications can exchange\n   image data. This\
    \ richness is required to take advantage of the\n   varying capabilities of scanners\
    \ and other imaging devices.  Though\n   TIFF is a rich format, it can easily\
    \ be used for simple scanners and\n   applications as well because the number\
    \ of required fields is small.\n"
- title: 2.2 TIFF Features
  contents:
  - "2.2 TIFF Features\n   Some of the features of TIFF (from [TIFF]) are:\n    -\
    \ TIFF is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color,\n      and\
    \ full-color image data in several color spaces.\n    - TIFF includes a number\
    \ of compression schemes that allow\n      developers to choose the best space\
    \ or time tradeoff for their\n      applications.\n    - TIFF is designed to be\
    \ extensible and to evolve gracefully as new\n      needs arise.\n    - TIFF allows\
    \ the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or\n      special-purpose information.\n"

- title: 3.1 image/tiff
  contents:
  - "3.1 image/tiff\n   The image/tiff content-type was previously defined in RFC\
    \ 1528 as\n   containing TIFF 6.0 encoded image data, with specific reference\
    \ made\n   to a subset known as TIFF Class F.  This document re-defines the\n\
    \   original image/tiff definition to refer to all of the profiles and\n   extensions\
    \ that build on TIFF 6.0 [TIFF] encoded image data,\n   consistent with existing\
    \ practice for TIFF aware Internet\n   applications.  This definition is further\
    \ enhanced by introducing the\n   new \"application parameter\" (section 3.2)\
    \ to enable identification of\n   a specific subset of TIFF and TIFF extensions\
    \ for the encoded image\n   data.\n"
- title: 3.2 Application parameter
  contents:
  - "3.2 Application parameter\n   There are cases where it may be useful to identify\
    \ the application\n   applicable to the content of an image/tiff body.  Typically,\
    \ this\n   would be used to assist the recipient in dispatching a suitable\n \
    \  rendering package to handle the display or processing of the image\n   file.\
    \  As a result, an optional \"application\" parameter is defined\n   for image/tiff\
    \ to identify a particular application's subset of TIFF\n   and TIFF extensions\
    \ for the encoded image data, if it is known.  No\n   values are defined in this\
    \ document.\n   Example using a fictional value 'foo':\n                 Content-type:\
    \ image/tiff; application=foo\n   There is no default value for application, as\
    \ the absence of the\n   application parameter indicates that the encoded TIFF\
    \ image is\n   Baseline TIFF or that it is not necessary to identify the\n   application.\
    \   It is up to the recipient's implementation to\n   determine the application\
    \ (if necessary) and render the image to the\n   user.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Registration
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Registration\n   To: ietf-types@iana.org\n   Subject: Registration of\
    \ Standard MIME media type image/tiff\n   MIME media type name: image\n   MIME\
    \ subtype name: tiff\n   Required parameters: none\n   Optional parameters: application\n\
    \      There is no format specified for the value of this parameter\n      in\
    \ addition to that specified by [MIME1].  Various\n      applications of TIFF\
    \ may define values as required.  New\n      values should be defined in standards\
    \ track RFCs and the\n      values should be registered with IANA, using the\n\
    \      registration form included in Appendix A.  There is no\n      default value\
    \ for application, as the absence of the\n      application parameter indicates\
    \ that the encoded TIFF image\n      is Baseline TIFF or that it is not necessary\
    \ to identify the\n      application.  It is up to the implementation to determine\n\
    \      the application (if necessary) and render the image to the\n      user.\n\
    \   Encoding considerations: Binary or Base-64 generally preferred\n   Security\
    \ considerations:\n      TIFF utilizes a structure which can store image data\
    \ and\n      attributes of this image data.   The fields defined in the\n    \
    \  TIFF specification are of a descriptive nature and provide\n      information\
    \ that is useful to facilitate viewing and\n      rendering of images by a recipient.\
    \  As such, the fields\n      currently defined in the TIFF specification do not\
    \ in\n      themselves create additional security risks, since the\n      fields\
    \ are not used to induce any particular behavior by\n      the recipient application.\n\
    \      TIFF has an extensible structure, so that it is\n      theoretically possible\
    \ that fields could be defined in the\n      future which could be used to induce\
    \ particular actions on\n      the part of the recipient, thus presenting additional\n\
    \      security risks, but this type of capability is not\n      supported in\
    \ the referenced TIFF specification. Indeed, the\n      definition of fields which\
    \ would include such processing\n      instructions is inconsistent with the goals\
    \ and spirit of\n      the TIFF specification.\n   Interoperability considerations:\n\
    \      The ability of implementations to handle all the defined\n      applications\
    \ (or profiles within applications) of TIFF may\n      not be ubiquitous.  As\
    \ a result, implementations may decode\n      and attempt to display the encoded\
    \ TIFF image data only to\n      determine that the image cannot be rendered.\
    \  The presence\n      of the application parameter may aid in allowing this\n\
    \      determination before dispatching for rendering.  However, it\n      should\
    \ be noted that the parameter value is not intended to\n      convey levels of\
    \ capabilities for a particular application.\n   Published specification:\n  \
