  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines the NAS-Filter-Rule attribute within
    the Remote\n   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS).  This attribute has
    the\n   same functionality as the Diameter NAS-Filter-Rule AVP (400) defined\n
    \  in [RFC4005], Section 6.6, and the same syntax as an IPFilterRule\n   defined
    in [RFC3588], Section 4.3.  This attribute may prove useful\n   for provisioning
    of filter rules.\n   While [RFC2865], Section 5.11, defines the Filter-Id attribute
    (11),\n   it requires that the Network Access Server (NAS) be pre-populated\n
    \  with the desired filters.  However, in situations where the server\n   operator
    does not know which filters have been pre-populated, it is\n   useful to specify
    filter rules explicitly.\n"

    - "1.3.  Attribute Interpretation\n   If a NAS conforming to this specification
      receives an Access-Accept\n   packet containing a NAS-Filter-Rule attribute
      that it cannot apply,\n   it MUST act as though it had received an Access-Reject.
      \ [RFC3576]\n   requires that a NAS receiving a Change of Authorization Request\n
      \  (CoA-Request) reply with a CoA-NAK if the Request contains an\n   unsupported
      attribute.  It is RECOMMENDED that an Error-Cause\n   attribute with value set
      to \"Unsupported Attribute\" (401) be included\n   in the CoA-NAK.  As noted
      in [RFC3576], authorization changes are\n   atomic so that this situation does
      not result in session termination,\n   and the pre-existing configuration remains
      unchanged.  As a result,\n   no accounting packets should be generated because
      of the CoA-Request.\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  NAS-Filter-Rule Attribute\n   Description\n   This attribute indicates filter
    rules to be applied for this user.\n   Zero or more NAS-Filter-Rule attributes
    MAY be sent in Access-Accept,\n   CoA-Request, or Accounting-Request packets.\n
    \  The NAS-Filter-Rule attribute is not intended to be used concurrently\n   with
    any other filter rule attribute, including Filter-Id (11) and\n   NAS-Traffic-Rule
    [Traffic] attributes.  NAS-Filter-Rule and NAS-\n   Traffic-Rule attributes MUST
    NOT appear in the same RADIUS packet.\n   If a NAS-Traffic-Rule attribute is present,
    a NAS implementing this\n   specification MUST silently discard any NAS-Filter-Rule
    attributes\n   that are present.  Filter-Id and NAS-Filter-Rule attributes SHOULD\n
    \  NOT appear in the same RADIUS packet.  Given the absence in [RFC4005]\n   of
    well-defined precedence rules for combining Filter-Id and NAS-\n   Filter-Rule
    attributes into a single rule set, the behavior of NASes\n   receiving both attributes
    is undefined, and therefore a RADIUS server\n   implementation cannot assume a
    consistent behavior.\n   Where multiple NAS-Filter-Rule attributes are included
    in a RADIUS\n   packet, the String field of the attributes are to be concatenated
    to\n   form a set of filter rules.  As noted in [RFC2865], Section 2.3, \"the\n
    \  forwarding server MUST NOT change the order of any attributes of the\n   same
    type\", so that RADIUS proxies will not reorder NAS-Filter-Rule\n   attributes.\n
    \  A summary of the NAS-Filter-Rule Attribute format is shown below.\n   The fields
    are transmitted from left to right.\n    0                   1                   2

    \  Type\n      92\n   Length\n      >=3\n   String\n      The String field is
    one or more octets.  It contains filter rules\n      in the IPFilterRule syntax
    defined in [RFC3588], Section 4.3, with\n      individual filter rules separated
    by a NUL (0x00).  A NAS-Filter-\n      Rule attribute may contain a partial rule,
    one rule, or more than\n      one rule.  Filter rules may be continued across
    attribute\n      boundaries, so implementations cannot assume that individual\n
    \     filter rules begin or end on attribute boundaries.\n      The set of NAS-Filter-Rule
    attributes SHOULD be created by\n      concatenating the individual filter rules,
    separated by a NUL\n      (0x00) octet.  The resulting data should be split on
    253-octet\n      boundaries to obtain a set of NAS-Filter-Rule attributes.  On\n
    \     reception, the individual filter rules are determined by\n      concatenating
    the contents of all NAS-Filter-Rule attributes, and\n      then splitting individual
    filter rules with the NUL octet (0x00)\n      as a delimiter.\n"

  - "4.  Diameter Considerations\n   [RFC4005], Section 6.6, defines the NAS-Filter-Rule
    AVP (400) with\n   the same functionality as the RADIUS NAS-Filter-Rule attribute.
    \ In\n   order to support interoperability, Diameter/RADIUS gateways will need\n
    \  to be configured to translate RADIUS attribute 92 to Diameter NAS-\n   Filter-Rule
    AVP (400) and vice versa.\n   When translating Diameter NAS-Filter-Rule AVPs to
    RADIUS NAS-Filter-\n   Rule attributes, the set of NAS-Filter-Rule attributes
    is created by\n   concatenating the individual filter rules, separated by a NUL
    octet.\n   The resulting data SHOULD then be split on 253-octet boundaries.\n
    \  When translating RADIUS NAS-Filter-Rule attributes to Diameter NAS-\n   Filter-Rule
    AVPs, the individual rules are determined by\n   concatenating the contents of
    all NAS-Filter-Rule attributes, and\n   then splitting individual filter rules
    with the NUL octet as a\n   delimiter.  Each rule is then encoded as a single
    Diameter NAS-\n   Filter-Rule AVP.\n   Note that a translated Diameter message
    can be larger than the\n   maximum RADIUS packet size (4096 bytes).  Where a Diameter/RADIUS\n
    \  gateway receives a Diameter message containing a NAS-Filter-Rule AVP\n   that
    is too large to fit into a RADIUS packet, the Diameter/RADIUS\n   gateway will
    respond to the originating Diameter peer with a Result-\n   Code AVP with the
    value DIAMETER_RADIUS_AVP_UNTRANSLATABLE (5018),\n   and with a Failed-AVP AVP
    containing the NAS-Filter-Rule AVP.  Since\n   repairing the error will probably
    require re-working the filter\n   rules, the originating peer should treat the
    combination of a\n   Result-Code AVP with value DIAMETER_RADIUS_AVP_UNTRANSLATABLE
    and a\n   Failed-AVP AVP containing a NAS-Filter-Rule AVP as a terminal error.\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification does not create any new registries.\n
    \  This document uses the RADIUS [RFC2865] namespace, see\n   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types>.
    \ One value has been\n   allocated in the section \"RADIUS Attribute Types\".
    \ The RADIUS\n   attribute for which a value has been assigned is:\n      92 -
    NAS-Filter-Rule\n   This document also utilizes the Diameter [RFC3588] namespace.
    \ A\n   Diameter Result-Code AVP value for the\n   DIAMETER_RADIUS_AVP_UNTRANSLATABLE
    error has been allocated.  Since\n   this is a permanent failure, the allocation
    (5018) is in the 5xxx\n   range.\n"
  title: 5.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This specification describes the use of RADIUS
    for purposes of\n   authentication, authorization and accounting.  Threats and
    security\n   issues for this application are described in [RFC3579] and [RFC3580];\n
    \  security issues encountered in roaming are described in [RFC2607].\n   This
    document specifies a new attribute that can be included in\n   existing RADIUS
    packets, which are protected as described in\n   [RFC3579] and [RFC3576].  See
    those documents for a more detailed\n   description.\n   The security mechanisms
    supported in RADIUS and Diameter are focused\n   on preventing an attacker from
    spoofing packets or modifying packets\n   in transit.  They do not prevent an
    authorized RADIUS/Diameter server\n   or proxy from modifying, inserting, or removing
    attributes with\n   malicious intent.  Filter attributes modified or removed by
    a\n   RADIUS/Diameter proxy may enable a user to obtain network access\n   without
    the appropriate filters; if the proxy were also to modify\n   accounting packets,
    then the modification would not be reflected in\n   the accounting server logs.\n
    \  Since the RADIUS protocol currently does not support capability\n   negotiation,
    a RADIUS server cannot automatically discover whether a\n   NAS supports the NAS-Filter-Rule
    attribute.  A legacy NAS not\n   compliant with this specification may silently
    discard the NAS-\n   Filter-Rule attribute while permitting the user to access
    the\n   network.  This can cause users to improperly receive unfiltered\n   access
    to the network.  As a result, the NAS-Filter-Rule attribute\n   SHOULD only be
    sent to a NAS that is known to support it.\n"
