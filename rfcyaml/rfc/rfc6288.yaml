  - "1.  Introduction\n   The DGIWG is a multi-national body responsible to the Defence\n\
    \   organizations of member nations for coordinated advice and policy\n   recommendations\
    \ on standards and practices for geospatial information\n   and support services.\
    \  The DGIWG creates standards and recommended\n   practices required to enable\
    \ the provision, exchange, and\n   exploitation of geospatial information.  It\
    \ supports the requirements\n   of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\
    \ and the other\n   alliances that its member nations participate in, including\n\
    \   peacekeeping sanctioned by the United Nations.\n   The DGIWG has defined,\
    \ and continues to define, standards, processes,\n   and procedures for the use\
    \ of international standards in the DGIWG\n   community.\n   The DGIWG geospatial\
    \ standards are built upon the generic and\n   abstract standards for geographic\
    \ information defined by the\n   International Organization for Standardization\
    \ (ISO) TC/211 technical\n   committee.  The DGIWG makes use of the service specifications\n\
    \   endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).\n   The DGIWG defines information\
    \ components for use in the development\n   of product specifications and application\
    \ schemas for military\n   geospatial data.  The DGIWG also establishes service\
    \ specifications,\n   encoding formats, and testing methodologies to meet military\n\
    \   geospatial intelligence requirements.\n   Some of the solutions being developed\
    \ by the DGIWG need XML\n   namespaces that are managed so that they are unique\
    \ and persistent.\n   To assure that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration\
    \ of a\n   specific Namespace ID (NID) for use by the DGIWG was deemed\n   appropriate.\
    \  Therefore, a full and complete registration will follow\n   the namespace specification\
    \ process as defined in [RFC3406].  For the\n   processes that the DGIWG uses\
    \ to manage this and other registries,\n   see the \"DGIWG Terminology Register\
    \ Technical Specification\" document\n   [STD-DP-07-024-ed1.0.1].\n"

    \   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n      The Namespace Specific String (NSS)\
    \ of all URNs that use the\n      \"dgiwg\" NID will have the following structure:\n\
    \         urn:dgiwg:{DGIWGresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}\n      where the\
    \ \"DGIWGresource\" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to\n      the URN syntax\
    \ requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class\n      of resource type.\
    \  Each resource type has a specific labeling\n      scheme that is covered by\
    \ \"ResourceSpecificString\", which also\n      conforms to the naming requirements\
    \ of [RFC2141].  The only\n      exception is that the character \":\" shall not\
    \ be used as part of\n      the \"DGIWGresource\" string.  This is to avoid possible\
    \ confusion.\n      Further, \"DGIWGresource\" is case sensitive.\n      The DGIWG\
    \ maintains a naming authority, the DGIWG Registration\n      System (DRS), that\
    \ will manage the assignment of \"DGIWGresources\"\n      and the specific registration\
    \ values assigned for each resource\n      class.  Other DGIWG standards documents\
    \ will define the\n      \"ResourceSpecificStrings\" for a given \"DGIWGresource\"\
    .\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      The DGIWG defines a number of specific\
    \ lists of information\n      elements that can be combined with the models in\
    \ product\n      specifications and application schema.  These are maintained\
    \ by\n      the DGIWG.  More information about the DRS, and the registration\n\
    \      activities and procedures to be followed, can be found in the\n      document\
    \ \"DGIWG Terminology Register Technical Specification\"\n      [STD-DP-07-024-ed1.0.1],\
    \ which provides the procedures for the\n      DGIWG registration of geographical\
    \ items.\n      https://portal.dgiwg.org/files/?artifact_id=5438&format=doc. \
    \ This\n      is a stable URI.  Additional information may be found at\n     \
    \ http://www.dgiwg.org/dgiwg/htm/registers/registers.htm.\n   Identifier uniqueness\
    \ considerations:\n      The DRS will manage resources using the \"dgiwg\" NID\
    \ and will be\n      the authority for managing the resource type identifiers\
    \ and\n      subsequent strings associated with them.  In the associated\n   \
    \   procedures, the DRS will ensure the uniqueness of the strings or\n      shall\
    \ permit secondary responsibility for management of well-\n      defined sub-trees.\
    \  URNs issued by the DRS may not be reassigned.\n      The DGIWG may permit use\
    \ of experimental type values that will not\n      be registered.  As a consequence,\
    \ multiple users may end up using\n      the same value for separate uses.  As\
    \ experimental usage is only\n      intended for testing purposes, this should\
    \ not be a real issue.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n      The DRS\
    \ will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of\n      the \"dgiwg\"\
    \ NID.  The DRS will establish a registry for\n      DGIWGresources.  Each DGIWGresource\
    \ will have a separate\n      description in the registry and may have its own\
    \ sub-registry.\n      The registries and information will be published and maintained\
    \ by\n      the DRS on its web site.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n \
    \     As defined in the DGIWG Terminology Register Technical\n      Specification,\
    \ the DRS will provide procedures for registration of\n      each type of resource\
    \ that it maintains.  Each such resource may\n      have three types of registration\
    \ activities:\n         1. Registered values associated with DGIWG specifications\
    \ or\n            services\n         2. Registration of values or sub-registries\
    \ to other entities\n         3. Name models to be used for experimental purposes\n\
    \   Process for identifier resolution:\n      The namespace is not listed with\
    \ a Resolution Discovery System\n      (RDS); this is not relevant.\n   Rules\
    \ for Lexical Equivalence:\n      No special considerations; the rules for lexical\
    \ equivalence of\n      [RFC2141] apply.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n  \
    \    No special considerations.\n   Validation mechanism:\n      None specified.\
    \  URN assignment will be handled by procedures\n      implemented in support\
    \ of DRS activities.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"

- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   The Defence Geospatial Information Working Group\
    \ is developing a\n   variety of applications and services.  Some of these services\
    \ require\n   that supporting information (e.g., data descriptions, attributes,\n\
    \   etc.) be fully specified.  For proper operation, descriptions of the\n   needed\
    \ supporting information must exist and be available in a\n   unique, reliable,\
    \ and persistent manner.  These dependencies provide\n   the basis of need for\
    \ namespaces, in one form or another.\n   As the work is ongoing and the Defence\
    \ Geospatial Information Working\n   Group covers many technical areas, the possibility\
    \ of binding to\n   various other namespace repositories has been deemed impractical.\n\
    \   Each object or description, as defined by the DGIWG, could possibly\n   be\
    \ related to multiple different other namespaces, so further\n   conflicts of\
    \ association could occur.  Thus, the intent is to utilize\n   the Defence Geospatial\
    \ Information Working Group Registration System,\n   operated by the DGIWG, as\
    \ the naming authority for DGIWG-defined\n   objects and descriptions.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   The objects and descriptions required for registration\
    \ services\n   defined by the DGIWG are publicly available for use by other\n\
    \   organizations.  The DGIWG will provide public access and support for\n   name\
    \ requests by other organizations.  This support can be enabled in\n   a timely\
    \ and responsive fashion as new objects and descriptions are\n   produced.  These\
    \ will be enabled in a fashion similar to current IANA\n   processes.  A description\
    \ of the DGIWG collaboration process is\n   available on the DGIWG website: http://www.dgiwg.org/dgiwg/.\n\
    \   Due to DGIWG coordination with other standards organizations and the\n   use\
    \ of standards from other standards organizations, there is a need\n   to avoid\
    \ duplicate or replicated names, such as those for coordinate\n   reference systems.\
    \  In order to coordinate the consistent use of\n   names and namespaces, the\
    \ DGIWG has formal relationships with both\n   the OGC and with ISO.  As long\
    \ as having consistent names and\n   namespaces across these organizations does\
    \ have security implications\n   for certain classes of applications (see below),\
    \ then shared names\n   and namespaces will be used.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   For many applications that use DGIWG standards\
    \ and terminology, there\n   are no additional security considerations other than\
    \ those normally\n   associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general\
    \ (which are\n   described in [RFC1737], [RFC2141], and [RFC3406]).  However,\
    \ for a\n   certain class of applications related to war fighter and peacekeeping\n\
    \   operations, there is a high level of importance for having secure\n   methods\
    \ to access locations once the URN resolution has taken place\n   (i.e., after\
    \ the name-to-location resolution).  In these cases,\n   agreed-upon military\
    \ command and control (C2) security, including\n   authentication and authorization,\
    \ shall be considered.  However, the\n   majority of communications in a military\
    \ environment, just as in any\n   environment, are low-level un-secure or minimally\
    \ secure information.\n   The Internet is well used, and a URN is necessary for\
    \ compatible web\n   services.\n"
