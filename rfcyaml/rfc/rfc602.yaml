  - "           \"The Stockings Were Hung by the Chimney with Care\"\nThe ARPA Computer\
    \ Network is susceptible to security violations for at least\nthe three following\
    \ reasons:\n(1)  Individual sites, used to physical limitations on machine access,\
    \ have\n     not yet taken sufficient precautions toward securing their systems\n\
    \     against unauthorized remote use.  For example, many people still use\n \
    \    passwords which are easy to guess:  their fist names, their initials,\n \
    \    their host name spelled backwards, a string of characters which are\n   \
    \  easy to type in sequence (e.g. ZXCVBNM).\n(2)  The TIP allows access to the\
    \ ARPANET to a much wider audience than\n     is thought or intended.  TIP phone\
    \ numbers are posted, like those\n     scribbled hastily on the walls of phone\
    \ booths and men's rooms.  The\n     TIP required no user identification before\
    \ giving service.  Thus,\n     many people, including those who used to spend\
    \ their time ripping off\n     Ma Bell, get access to our stockings in a most\
    \ anonymous way.\n(3)  There is lingering affection for the challenge of breaking\n\
    \     someone's system.  This affection lingers despite the fact that\n     everyone\
    \ knows that it's easy to break systems, even easier to\n     crash them.\nAll\
    \ of this would be quite humorous and cause for raucous eye\nwinking and elbow\
    \ nudging, if it weren't for the fact that in\nrecent weeks at least two major\
    \ serving hosts were crashed\nunder suspicious circumstances by people who knew\
    \ what they\nwere risking; on yet a third system, the system wheel password\n\
    was compromised -- by two high school students in Los Angeles\nno less.\nWe suspect\
    \ that the number of dangerous security violations is\nlarger than any of us know\
    \ is growing.  You are advised\nnot to sit \"in hope that Saint Nicholas would\
    \ soon be there\".\n"
