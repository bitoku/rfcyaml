  - "Introduction\n   This RFC defines the format of new Resource Records (RRs) for\
    \ the\n   Domain Name System (DNS), and reserves corresponding DNS type\n   mnemonics\
    \ and numerical codes.  The definitions are in three\n   independent sections:\
    \ (1) location of AFS database servers, (2)\n   location of responsible persons,\
    \ and (3) representation of X.25 and\n   ISDN addresses and route binding.  All\
    \ are experimental.\n   This RFC assumes that the reader is familiar with the\
    \ DNS [3,4].  The\n   data shown is for pedagogical use and does not necessarily\
    \ reflect\n   the real Internet.\n"
- title: 1. AFS Data Base location
  contents:
  - "1. AFS Data Base location\n   This section defines an extension of the DNS to\
    \ locate servers both\n   for AFS (AFS is a registered trademark of Transarc Corporation)\
    \ and\n   for the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing\n   Environment\
    \ (DCE) authenticated naming system using HP/Apollo's NCA,\n   both to be components\
    \ of the OSF DCE.  The discussion assumes that\n   the reader is familiar with\
    \ AFS [5] and NCA [6].\n   The AFS (originally the Andrew File System) system\
    \ uses the DNS to\n   map from a domain name to the name of an AFS cell database\
    \ server.\n   The DCE Naming service uses the DNS for a similar function: mapping\n\
    \   from the domain name of a cell to authenticated name servers for that\n  \
    \ cell.  The method uses a new RR type with mnemonic AFSDB and type\n   code of\
    \ 18 (decimal).\n   AFSDB has the following format:\n   <owner> <ttl> <class>\
    \ AFSDB <subtype> <hostname>\n   Both RDATA fields are required in all AFSDB RRs.\
    \  The <subtype> field\n   is a 16 bit integer.  The <hostname> field is a domain\
    \ name of a host\n   that has a server for the cell named by the owner name of\
    \ the RR.\n   The format of the AFSDB RR is class insensitive.  AFSDB records\
    \ cause\n   type A additional section processing for <hostname>.  This, in fact,\n\
    \   is the rationale for using a new type code, rather than trying to\n   build\
    \ the same functionality with TXT RRs.\n   Note that the format of AFSDB in a\
    \ master file is identical to MX.\n   For purposes of the DNS itself, the subtype\
    \ is merely an integer.\n   The present subtype semantics are discussed below,\
    \ but changes are\n   possible and will be announced in subsequent RFCs.\n   In\
    \ the case of subtype 1, the host has an AFS version 3.0 Volume\n   Location Server\
    \ for the named AFS cell.  In the case of subtype 2,\n   the host has an authenticated\
    \ name server holding the cell-root\n   directory node for the named DCE/NCA cell.\n\
    \   The use of subtypes is motivated by two considerations.  First, the\n   space\
    \ of DNS RR types is limited.  Second, the services provided are\n   sufficiently\
    \ distinct that it would continue to be confusing for a\n   client to attempt\
    \ to connect to a cell's servers using the protocol\n   for one service, if the\
    \ cell offered only the other service.\n   As an example of the use of this RR,\
    \ suppose that the Toaster\n   Corporation has deployed AFS 3.0 but not (yet)\
    \ the OSF's DCE.  Their\n   cell, named toaster.com, has three \"AFS 3.0 cell\
    \ database server\"\n   machines: bigbird.toaster.com, ernie.toaster.com, and\n\
    \   henson.toaster.com.  These three machines would be listed in three\n   AFSDB\
    \ RRs.  These might appear in a master file as:\n   toaster.com.   AFSDB   1 bigbird.toaster.com.\n\
    \   toaster.com.   AFSDB   1 ernie.toaster.com.\n   toaster.com.   AFSDB   1 henson.toaster.com.\n\
    \   As another example use of this RR, suppose that Femto College (domain\n  \
    \ name femto.edu) has deployed DCE, and that their DCE cell root\n   directory\
    \ is served by processes running on green.femto.edu and\n   turquoise.femto.edu.\
    \  Furthermore, their DCE file servers also run\n   AFS 3.0-compatible volume\
    \ location servers, on the hosts\n   turquoise.femto.edu and orange.femto.edu.\
    \  These machines would be\n   listed in four AFSDB RRs, which might appear in\
    \ a master file as:\n   femto.edu.   AFSDB   2 green.femto.edu.\n   femto.edu.\
    \   AFSDB   2 turquoise.femto.edu.\n   femto.edu.   AFSDB   1 turquoise.femto.edu.\n\
    \   femto.edu.   AFSDB   1 orange.femto.edu.\n"
- title: 2. Responsible Person
  contents:
  - "2. Responsible Person\n   The purpose of this section is to provide a standard\
    \ method for\n   associating responsible person identification to any name in\
    \ the DNS.\n   The domain name system functions as a distributed database which\n\
    \   contains many different form of information.  For a particular name\n   or\
    \ host, you can discover it's Internet address, mail forwarding\n   information,\
    \ hardware type and operating system among others.\n   A key aspect of the DNS\
    \ is that the tree-structured namespace can be\n   divided into pieces, called\
    \ zones, for purposes of distributing\n   control and responsibility.  The responsible\
    \ person for zone database\n   purposes is named in the SOA RR for that zone.\
    \  This section\n   describes an extension which allows different responsible\
    \ persons to\n   be specified for different names in a zone.\n"
- title: 2.1. Identification of the guilty party
  contents:
  - "2.1. Identification of the guilty party\n   Often it is desirable to be able\
    \ to identify the responsible entity\n   for a particular host.  When that host\
    \ is down or malfunctioning, it\n   is difficult to contact those parties which\
    \ might resolve or repair\n   the host.  Mail sent to POSTMASTER may not reach\
    \ the person in a\n   timely fashion.  If the host is one of a multitude of workstations,\n\
    \   there may be no responsible person which can be contacted on that\n   host.\n\
    \   The POSTMASTER mailbox on that host continues to be a good contact\n   point\
    \ for mail problems, and the zone contact in the SOA record for\n   database problem,\
    \ but the RP record allows us to associate a mailbox\n   to entities that don't\
    \ receive mail or are not directly connected\n   (namespace-wise) to the problem\
    \ (e.g., GATEWAY.ISI.EDU might want to\n   point at HOTLINE@BBN.COM, and GATEWAY\
    \ doesn't get mail, nor does the\n   ISI zone administrator have a clue about\
    \ fixing gateways).\n"
- title: 2.2. The Responsible Person RR
  contents:
  - "2.2. The Responsible Person RR\n   The method uses a new RR type with mnemonic\
    \ RP and type code of 17\n   (decimal).\n   RP has the following format:\n   <owner>\
    \ <ttl> <class> RP <mbox-dname> <txt-dname>\n   Both RDATA fields are required\
    \ in all RP RRs.\n   The first field, <mbox-dname>, is a domain name that specifies\
    \ the\n   mailbox for the responsible person.  Its format in master files uses\n\
    \   the DNS convention for mailbox encoding, identical to that used for\n   the\
    \ RNAME mailbox field in the SOA RR.  The root domain name (just\n   \".\") may\
    \ be specified for <mbox-dname> to indicate that no mailbox is\n   available.\n\
    \   The second field, <txt-dname>, is a domain name for which TXT RR's\n   exist.\
    \  A subsequent query can be performed to retrieve the\n   associated TXT resource\
    \ records at <txt-dname>.  This provides a\n   level of indirection so that the\
    \ entity can be referred to from\n   multiple places in the DNS.  The root domain\
    \ name (just \".\") may be\n   specified for <txt-dname> to indicate that the\
    \ TXT_DNAME is absent,\n   and no associated TXT RR exists.\n   The format of\
    \ the RP RR is class insensitive.  RP records cause no\n   additional section\
    \ processing.  (TXT additional section processing\n   for <txt-dname> is allowed\
    \ as an option, but only if it is disabled\n   for the root, i.e., \".\").\n \
    \  The Responsible Person RR can be associated with any node in the\n   Domain\
    \ Name System hierarchy, not just at the leaves of the tree.\n   The TXT RR associated\
    \ with the TXT_DNAME contain free format text\n   suitable for humans.  Refer\
    \ to [4] for more details on the TXT RR.\n   Multiple RP records at a single name\
    \ may be present in the database.\n   They should have identical TTLs.\n   EXAMPLES\n\

- title: 3. X.25 and ISDN addresses, Route Binding
  contents:
  - "3. X.25 and ISDN addresses, Route Binding\n   This section describes an experimental\
    \ representation of X.25 and\n   ISDN addresses in the DNS, as well as a route\
    \ binding method,\n   analogous to the MX for mail routing, for very large scale\
    \ networks.\n   There are several possible uses, all experimental at this time.\n\
    \   First, the RRs provide simple documentation of the correct addresses\n   to\
    \ use in static configurations of IP/X.25 [11] and SMTP/X.25 [12].\n   The RRs\
    \ could also be used automatically by an internet network-layer\n   router, typically\
    \ IP.  The procedure would be to map IP address to\n   domain name, then name\
    \ to canonical name if needed, then following RT\n   records, and finally attempting\
    \ an IP/X.25 call to the address found.\n   Alternately, configured domain names\
    \ could be resolved to identify IP\n   to X.25/ISDN bindings for a static but\
    \ periodically refreshed routing\n   table.\n   This provides a function similar\
    \ to ARP for wide area non-broadcast\n   networks that will scale well to a network\
    \ with hundreds of millions\n   of hosts.\n   Also, a standard address binding\
    \ reference will facilitate other\n   experiments in the use of X.25 and ISDN,\
    \ especially in serious\n   inter-operability testing.  The majority of work in\
    \ such a test is\n   establishing the n-squared entries in static tables.\n  \
    \ Finally, the RRs are intended for use in a proposal [13] by one of\n   the authors\
    \ for a possible next-generation internet.\n"
- title: 3.1. The X25 RR
  contents:
  - "3.1. The X25 RR\n   The X25 RR is defined with mnemonic X25 and type code 19\
    \ (decimal).\n   X25 has the following format:\n   <owner> <ttl> <class> X25 <PSDN-address>\n\
    \   <PSDN-address> is required in all X25 RRs.\n   <PSDN-address> identifies the\
    \ PSDN (Public Switched Data Network)\n   address in the X.121 [10] numbering\
    \ plan associated with <owner>.\n   Its format in master files is a <character-string>\
    \ syntactically\n   identical to that used in TXT and HINFO.\n   The format of\
    \ X25 is class insensitive.  X25 RRs cause no additional\n   section processing.\n\
    \   The <PSDN-address> is a string of decimal digits, beginning with the\n   4\
    \ digit DNIC (Data Network Identification Code), as specified in\n   X.121. National\
    \ prefixes (such as a 0) MUST NOT be used.\n   For example:\n   Relay.Prime.COM.\
    \  X25       311061700956\n"
- title: 3.2. The ISDN RR
  contents:
  - "3.2. The ISDN RR\n   The ISDN RR is defined with mnemonic ISDN and type code\
    \ 20 (decimal).\n   An ISDN (Integrated Service Digital Network) number is simply\
    \ a\n   telephone number.  The intent of the members of the CCITT is to\n   upgrade\
    \ all telephone and data network service to a common service.\n   The numbering\
    \ plan (E.163/E.164) is the same as the familiar\n   international plan for POTS\
    \ (an un-official acronym, meaning Plain\n   Old Telephone Service).  In E.166,\
    \ CCITT says \"An E.163/E.164\n   telephony subscriber may become an ISDN subscriber\
    \ without a number\n   change.\"\n   ISDN has the following format:\n   <owner>\
    \ <ttl> <class> ISDN <ISDN-address> <sa>\n   The <ISDN-address> field is required;\
    \ <sa> is optional.\n   <ISDN-address> identifies the ISDN number of <owner> and\
    \ DDI (Direct\n   Dial In) if any, as defined by E.164 [8] and E.163 [7], the\
    \ ISDN and\n   PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) numbering plan.  E.163\n\
    \   defines the country codes, and E.164 the form of the addresses.  Its\n   format\
    \ in master files is a <character-string> syntactically\n   identical to that\
    \ used in TXT and HINFO.\n   <sa> specifies the subaddress (SA).  The format of\
    \ <sa> in master\n   files is a <character-string> syntactically identical to\
    \ that used in\n   TXT and HINFO.\n   The format of ISDN is class insensitive.\
    \  ISDN RRs cause no\n   additional section processing.\n   The <ISDN-address>\
    \ is a string of characters, normally decimal\n   digits, beginning with the E.163\
    \ country code and ending with the DDI\n   if any.  Note that ISDN, in Q.931,\
    \ permits any IA5 character in the\n   general case.\n   The <sa> is a string\
    \ of hexadecimal digits.  For digits 0-9, the\n   concrete encoding in the Q.931\
    \ call setup information element is\n   identical to BCD.\n   For example:\n \
    \  Relay.Prime.COM.   IN   ISDN      150862028003217\n   sh.Prime.COM.      IN\
    \   ISDN      150862028003217 004\n   (Note: \"1\" is the country code for the\
    \ North American Integrated\n   Numbering Area, i.e., the system of \"area codes\"\
    \ familiar to people\n   in those countries.)\n   The RR data is the ASCII representation\
    \ of the digits.  It is encoded\n   as one or two <character-string>s, i.e., count\
    \ followed by\n   characters.\n   CCITT recommendation E.166 [9] defines prefix\
    \ escape codes for the\n   representation of ISDN (E.163/E.164) addresses in X.121,\
    \ and PSDN\n   (X.121) addresses in E.164.  It specifies that the exact codes\
    \ are a\n   \"national matter\", i.e., different on different networks.  A host\n\
    \   connected to the ISDN may be able to use both the X25 and ISDN\n   addresses,\
    \ with the local prefix added.\n"
- title: 3.3. The Route Through RR
  contents:
  - "3.3. The Route Through RR\n   The Route Through RR is defined with mnemonic RT\
    \ and type code 21\n   (decimal).\n   The RT resource record provides a route-through\
    \ binding for hosts\n   that do not have their own direct wide area network addresses.\
    \  It is\n   used in much the same way as the MX RR.\n   RT has the following\
    \ format:\n   <owner> <ttl> <class> RT <preference> <intermediate-host>\n   Both\
    \ RDATA fields are required in all RT RRs.\n   The first field, <preference>,\
    \ is a 16 bit integer, representing the\n   preference of the route.  Smaller\
    \ numbers indicate more preferred\n   routes.\n   <intermediate-host> is the domain\
    \ name of a host which will serve as\n   an intermediate in reaching the host\
    \ specified by <owner>.  The DNS\n   RRs associated with <intermediate-host> are\
    \ expected to include at\n   least one A, X25, or ISDN record.\n   The format\
    \ of the RT RR is class insensitive.  RT records cause type\n   X25, ISDN, and\
    \ A additional section processing for <intermediate-\n   host>.\n   For example,\n\
    \   sh.prime.com.      IN   RT   2    Relay.Prime.COM.\n                     \
    \ IN   RT   10   NET.Prime.COM.\n   *.prime.com.       IN   RT   90   Relay.Prime.COM.\n\
    \   When a host is looking up DNS records to attempt to route a datagram,\n  \
    \ it first looks for RT records for the destination host, which point\n   to hosts\
    \ with address records (A, X25, ISDN) compatible with the wide\n   area networks\
    \ available to the host.  If it is itself in the set of\n   RT records, it discards\
    \ any RTs with preferences higher or equal to\n   its own.  If there are no (remaining)\
    \ RTs, it can then use address\n   records of the destination itself.\n   Wild-card\
    \ RTs are used exactly as are wild-card MXs.  RT's do not\n   \"chain\"; that\
    \ is, it is not valid to use the RT RRs found for a host\n   referred to by an\
    \ RT.\n   The concrete encoding is identical to the MX RR.\n"
