  - "1.  Introduction\n   Increasingly, large ISPs are encountering issues with P2P\
    \ traffic.\n   The transfer of static, delay-tolerant data between nodes on the\n\
    \   Internet is a well-understood problem, but traditional management of\n   fairness\
    \ at the transport level is under strain from applications\n   designed to achieve\
    \ the best end-user transfer rates.  At peak times,\n   this results in networks\
    \ running near absolute capacity, causing all\n   traffic to incur delays; the\
    \ applications that bear the brunt of this\n   additional latency are real-time\
    \ applications like Voice over IP\n   (VoIP) and Internet gaming.  To explore\
    \ how IETF standards work could\n   be useful in addressing these issues, the\
    \ Real-time Applications and\n   Infrastructure area directors organized a \"\
    P2P Infrastructure\"\n   workshop and invited contributions from subject matter\
    \ experts in the\n   problem and solution spaces.\n   The goals of the workshop\
    \ were twofold: to understand the technical\n   problems that ISPs and end users\
    \ are experiencing as a result of high\n   volumes of P2P traffic, and to begin\
    \ to understand how the IETF may\n   be helpful in addressing these problems.\
    \  Gaining an understanding of\n   where in the IETF this work might be pursued\
    \ and how to extract\n   feasible work items were highlighted as important tasks\
    \ in pursuit of\n   the latter goal.  The workshop's focus was on engineering\
    \ solutions\n   that promise some imminent benefit to the Internet as a whole,\
    \ as\n   opposed to longer-term research or closed proprietary solutions.\n  \
    \ While public policy must inform work in this space, crafting or\n   debating\
    \ public policy was outside the scope of the workshop.\n   Position papers were\
    \ solicited in the weeks prior to the workshop,\n   and a limited number of speakers\
    \ were invited to present their views\n   at the workshop based on these submissions.\
    \  This report is a summary\n   of all participants' contributions.  The program\
    \ committee and\n   participant list are attached in Appendices A and B, respectively.\n\
    \   The agenda of the workshop can be found in Appendix C.  A link to the\n  \
    \ presentations given at the workshop and the position papers submitted\n   prior\
    \ to the workshop is in Appendix D.\n   The workshop showcased the IETF community's\
    \ recognition of the impact\n   of P2P and other high-volume applications on the\
    \ Internet as a whole.\n   Participants welcomed the opportunity to discuss potential\n\
    \   standardization work that network operators, applications providers,\n   and\
    \ end users would all find mutually beneficial.  Two transport-\n   related work\
    \ items gained significant traction: designing a protocol\n   for very deferential\
    \ end-to-end congestion control for delay-tolerant\n   applications, and producing\
    \ an informational document about the\n   reasoning behind and effects of applications\
    \ opening multiple\n   transport connections at once.  A separate area of interest\
    \ that\n   emerged at the workshop focused on improving peer selection by having\n\
    \   networks make more information available to applications.  Finally,\n   presenters\
    \ also covered traditional approaches to multiple service-\n   tier queuing such\
    \ as Diffserv.\n"

  - "2.  Scoping of the Problem and Solution Spaces\n   The genesis for the Peer-to-Peer\
    \ Infrastructure (P2PI) workshop grew\n   in large part out of specific pain points\
    \ that ISPs are experiencing\n   as a result of high volumes of P2P traffic. \
    \ However, several\n   workshop participants felt that the IETF should approach\
    \ a more\n   general space of problems, of which P2P-related congestion may be\n\
    \   merely one instance.\n   For example, high-volume applications besides P2P,\
    \ whether they\n   already exist or have yet to be developed, could cause congestion\n\
    \   issues similar to those caused by P2P.  The general class of\n   congestion\
    \ problems attributable to always-on, high-volume\n   applications require the\
    \ development of solutions that are reasonable\n   for operators, applications,\
    \ and subscribers.  And while much\n   attention has been paid to congestion on\
    \ access links, increased\n   traffic volumes could impact other parts of the\
    \ network.  Although\n   the workshop focused primarily on the specific causes\
    \ and effects of\n   current P2P traffic volumes, it will likely be useful in\
    \ the future\n   for the IETF to consider how to pursue solutions to these larger\n\
    \   problems.\n   Obtaining more data about Internet congestion may also be a\
    \ helpful\n   step before the IETF pursues solutions.  This data collection could\n\
    \   focus on where in the network congestion is occurring, its duration\n   and\
    \ frequency, its effects, and its root causes.  Although individual\n   service\
    \ providers expressed interest in sharing congestion data,\n   strategies for\
    \ reliably and regularly obtaining and disseminating\n   such data on a broad\
    \ scale remain elusive.\n"

    \ of one specific\n   network operator's view of P2P-induced congestion, Jason\

    \   approach to management of P2P traffic.\n"
- title: 3.1.  DOCSIS Architecture and Upstream Contention
  contents:
  - "3.1.  DOCSIS Architecture and Upstream Contention\n   In the Data Over Cable\
    \ Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)\n   architecture [DOCSIS] that is used\
    \ for many cable systems, there may\n   be a single Cable Modem Termination System\
    \ (CMTS) serving hundreds or\n   thousands of residential cable customers.  Each\
    \ CMTS has multiple\n   DOCSIS domains, each of which typically has a single downstream\
    \ link\n   and a number of upstream links.  Each CMTS is connected through a\n\
    \   hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) network to subscribers' cable modems.\n   The limiting\
    \ resource in this architecture is usually bandwidth, so\n   bandwidth is typically\
    \ the measure used for capacity planning.  As\n   with all networks, congestion\
    \ manifests itself when instantaneous\n   load exceeds available capacity.\n \
    \  In the upstream direction, any cable modem connected to a CMTS can\n   make\
    \ a request to the CMTS to transmit, and requests are randomized\n   to minimize\
    \ collisions.  With many cable modems issuing requests at\n   once, the requests\
    \ may collide, resulting in delays.  DOCSIS does not\n   specify a size for cable\
    \ modem buffers, but buffer delays of one to\n   four seconds have been observed\
    \ with various cable modems from\n   different vendors.\n   Once the CMTS has\
    \ granted a cable modem the ability to transmit its\n   data PDU, the modem can\
    \ piggyback its next request on top of that\n   data PDU.  In situations with\
    \ a lot of upstream traffic, piggybacking\n   happens more often, which sends\
    \ heavy upstream users to the front of\n   the CMTS queue, ahead of interactive\
    \ but less-upstream-intensive\n   applications.  For example, if the CMTS is granting\
    \ requests\n   approximately every one to three milliseconds, then a cable modem\n\
    \   transmitting data for a service like VoIP with a packetization delay\n   of\
    \ 20-30 milliseconds may get into contention with another modem on\n   the same\
    \ CMTS that is constantly transmitting upstream and\n   piggybacking each new\
    \ request.  This may explain how heavy upstream\n   users ultimately dominate\
    \ the pipe over more interactive\n   applications.  Consequentially, it is imperative\
    \ that assessments of\n   the problem space and potential solutions are mindful\
    \ of the\n   influence that specific layer-2 networks may exert on the behavior\
    \ of\n   Internet traffic, especially when considering the alleviation of\n  \
    \ congestion in an access network.\n"
- title: 3.2.  TCP Flow Fairness and Service Flows
  contents:
  - "3.2.  TCP Flow Fairness and Service Flows\n   How TCP flow fairness applies to\
    \ upstream requests to the CMTS is an\n   open question.  A CMTS sees many service\
    \ flows, each of which could\n   be a single TCP flow or many TCP flows (or UDP).\
    \  The CMTS is not\n   aware of the source or destination IP address of a packet\
    \ until it\n   has already been transmitted upstream, so those cannot be used\
    \ to\n   impose flow fairness.\n   A particular cable modem can have multiple\
    \ service flows defined.\n   For example, a modem that is also a VoIP endpoint\
    \ can provision a\n   service flow for VoIP that would allow VoIP traffic to avoid\
    \ the\n   upstream request process to the CMTS (and thereby avoid contention\n\
    \   with other modems).  The service flow would have upstream capacity\n   provisioned\
    \ for it.  The modem would have a separate service flow for\n   best efforts traffic.\
    \  Some ISPs provision such a flow for their own\n   VoIP offerings; others allow\
    \ subscribers to pay extra to have\n   particular traffic assigned to a provisioned\
    \ service flow.\n   It may also be possible for an ISP to provision such a flow\
    \ on the\n   fly when it recognizes the need for it.  Diffserv [RFC2475] bits\
    \ set\n   by the customer premises equipment could be used to classify flows,\n\
    \   for example.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Service Provider Responses
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Service Provider Responses\n   In 2005, ISP customers began increasingly\
    \ complaining about the\n   performance of delay-sensitive traffic (VoIP and gaming),\
    \ due in part\n   to the issues arising out of the DOCSIS architecture as described\n\
    \   above.  At the same time, ISPs were seeing heavy growth in P2P\n   traffic\
    \ and an increasing correlation between high levels of P2P\n   activity and packet\
    \ loss.\n   In responding to this situation, cable ISPs have several avenues to\n\
    \   pursue.  The newest generation of the DOCSIS specification, DOCSIS\n   3.0,\
    \ enables faster transfer rates than most cable systems currently\n   support.\
    \  While the rollout of DOCSIS 3.0 will provide additional\n   capacity, it will\
    \ likely not obviate the need for congestion\n   management in an environment\
    \ where client software is designed to\n   maximize bandwidth consumption regardless\
    \ of available capacity.\n   Congestion management can take many forms; Jason\
    \ and Rich explained\n   the new protocol-agnostic approach that Comcast is currently\n\
    \   trialing.  Prior to these trials, all traffic was marked as \"best\n   efforts\"\
    .  During the trials, all traffic is re-classified as\n   \"priority\".  When\
    \ a CMTS is approaching peak congestion on a\n   particular upstream or downstream\
    \ port (the \"Near Congestion State\"),\n   some subscribers will have traffic\
    \ re-classified as \"best efforts\".\n   Both the threshold for determining when\
    \ a CMTS port is in Near\n   Congestion State and the number of minutes it remains\
    \ in this state\n   are parameters being explored during the trials.  To re-classify\n\
    \   upstream traffic, a new default DOCSIS service flow is used that has\n   the\
    \ same provisioned bandwidth as the \"priority\" stream but that is\n   treated\
    \ with lower priority.\n   The subscribers whose traffic is re-marked will be\
    \ selected by\n   determining whether they have temporarily entered a \"Long Duration\n\
    \   Bulk Consumption State\".  This state is achieved by consuming a\n   certain\
    \ amount of bandwidth over a certain period of minutes (both\n   are tweakable\
    \ parameters being explored during the trials).  These\n   thresholds will depend\
    \ on the subscriber's service tier --\n   subscribers who pay for more bandwidth\
    \ will have higher thresholds.\n   The re-marking will not distinguish between\
    \ multiple users of the\n   same subscriber connection, so one family member's\
    \ P2P usage could\n   cause another family member's Web browsing traffic to be\
    \ lowered in\n   priority.  There is no current mechanism for users to determine\
    \ that\n   their traffic has been re-marked.\n   By temporarily reducing the traffic\
    \ priority of subscribers who have\n   been consuming bandwidth in bulk for lengthy\
    \ periods, this congestion\n   management technique aims to preserve a good user\
    \ experience for\n   subscribers with burstier traffic patterns, including those\
    \ using\n   real-time applications.  As compared to an approach that reduces\n\
    \   particular subscribers' bandwidth during periods of congestion, this\n   technique\
    \ eliminates the ability for applications to set their own\n   priority levels,\
    \ but it also avoids the negative connotations that\n   some users may associate\
    \ with bandwidth reductions.\n   This approach involves many tweakable parameters.\
    \  A large part of\n   the trial process is aimed at determining the best settings\
    \ for these\n   parameters, but there may also be opportunities to work with the\n\
    \   research community to identify the best way to adjust the thresholds\n   necessary\
    \ to optimize the performance of the management technique.\n"
- title: 4.  Application Provider Perspective
  contents:
  - "4.  Application Provider Perspective\n   Stanislav Shalunov provided an overview\
    \ of BitTorrent's view of the\n   impact of increased P2P traffic volumes and\
    \ potential mitigations.\n   The impact is described here; his proposed solutions\
    \ (comprising the\n   bulk of his talk) are addressed in the appropriate subsections\
    \ of\n   Section 5.\n   As uptake in P2P usage has grown, so has end-user latency.\
    \  For\n   example, a user whose uplink capacity is 250-500 Kbps and whose modem\n\
    \   buffer has a capacity of 32-64 Kbps may easily fill the buffer\n   (unless\
    \ the modem uses Adaptive Queue Management (AQM), which is\n   uncommon).  This\
    \ can result in delay on the order of seconds, with\n   disastrous effects on\
    \ application performance.  On a cable system\n   with shared capacity between\
    \ neighbors, one neighbor could saturate\n   the buffer and affect the latency\
    \ of another neighbor's traffic.\n   Even users with dedicated bandwidth can experience\
    \ delays as their\n   own P2P traffic saturates the link and dominates their own\
    \ more\n   latency-sensitive traffic.\n"

- title: '5.1.  Improving Peer Selection: Information Sharing, Localization, and'
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Improving Peer Selection: Information Sharing, Localization, and\n    \
    \  Caches\n   Peer selection is an integral factor in determining the efficiency\
    \ of\n   P2P networks from both the ISP and the P2P client points of view.\n \
    \  How peers are selected will determine both network load and client\n   performance.\n\
    \   The way that P2P clients select peers today varies from protocol to\n   protocol\
    \ and client to client but, in general, peers are largely\n   oblivious to routing-level\
    \ and network-topology information.  This\n   results in P2P topologies that are\
    \ agnostic of underlay topologies\n   and constraints.\n   Approaches to closing\
    \ this gap generally involve an entity that has\n   knowledge of network topology,\
    \ costs, or constraints (e.g., an ISP)\n   making some of this information available\
    \ to P2P clients or trackers.\n   This information may be used to localize traffic\
    \ based on some metric\n   of locality or to otherwise alter peer-selection decisions\
    \ based on\n   the provided network information (hereafter referred to simply\
    \ as\n   \"localization\").  One special case of this kind of approach would\n\
    \   help peers find caches containing the content they seek.\n   Any alteration\
    \ to current peer-selection algorithms will have\n   engineering trade-offs. \
    \ BitTorrent, for example, used randomized\n   peer selection by design.  Choosing\
    \ peers randomly out of a large\n   selection helps to average out problems among\
    \ peers and allows for\n   connections to good peers that may be far away.  Randomized\
    \ peer\n   selection also supports \"rarest first\" piece selection, which allows\n\
    \   swarms to continue even when the original seed disappears and which\n   distributes\
    \ pieces so that more peers are likely to have pieces of\n   interest to other\
    \ peers.  Any move away from randomized selection\n   would have to take these\
    \ factors into account.\n   Although localization has the potential to improve\
    \ peer selection,\n   the incentives for both parties to the information exchange\
    \ are\n   complex.  ISPs may want to move traffic off of their own networks,\n\
    \   which could motivate them to provide information to peers that has\n   the\
    \ opposite effect of what the peers would expect.  Likewise, peers\n   will want\
    \ the use of the information they receive to result in\n   performance improvements;\
    \ otherwise, they have no incentive to\n   consult with the network before selecting\
    \ peers.  Even when both\n   parties find the information sharing to be beneficial,\
    \ user\n   experiences will not necessarily be uniform depending on the scope\
    \ of\n   the information provided and the peer's location.  Localization\n   information\
    \ could form one component of a peer-selection decision,\n   but it will likely\
    \ need to be balanced against other factors.\n   Workshop participants discussed\
    \ both current research efforts in this\n   area and how IETF standards work may\
    \ be useful in furthering the\n   general concept of improved peer selection.\
    \  Those discussions are\n   summarized below.\n"
- title: 5.1.1.  Leveraging AS Numbers
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Leveraging AS Numbers\n   One simple way to potentially make peer selection\
    \ more efficient\n   would be for a peer to prefer peers within its own Autonomous\
    \ System\n   (AS).  Transfers between peers within the same AS may be faster on\n\
    \   some networks, although more data is needed to determine the extent\n   of\
    \ the potential improvement.  On mobile networks, for example, the\n   utility\
    \ of AS numbers is limited since they do not correlate to\n   geographic location.\
    \  Peers may also see improvements by connecting\n   to other peers within a specific\
    \ set of ASes or IP prefixes provided\n   by their ISPs.  Some ISPs may have an\
    \ incentive to expose this\n   granularity of information because it will potentially\
    \ reduce their\n   transit costs.\n   A case study was conducted with the four\
    \ most popular BitTorrent\n   torrents to determine what the effect of localizing\
    \ to an AS might\n   be.  The swarm sizes for the torrents were 9984, 3944, 2561,\
    \ and\n   2023, with the size distributions appearing to be polynomial.  With\n\
    \   more than 20 peers in a single AS, peers within an AS could trade\n   only\
    \ with each other, avoiding interdomain traffic.  More than half\n   (57%) of\
    \ peers in the four swarms were in ASes like this.  Thus, in\n   these cases connecting\
    \ to peers within an AS could reduce transit\n   traffic by at least 57%.  If\
    \ the ASes have asymmetric upload and\n   download links, however, the resulting\
    \ user experience may\n   deteriorate since each peer's download speed would be\
    \ limited by\n   slower upload speeds.\n   With the largest swarm size at 9984,\
    \ the probability of two peers\n   being in the same neighborhood is too low to\
    \ make localization to the\n   neighborhood level worthwhile.  Attempting a simple\
    \ localization\n   scheme, such as the AS localization described above, and determining\n\
    \   its effectiveness likely makes more sense as a first step.\n"

  - "5.1.3.  Multi-Layer, Tracker-Based Architecture\n   The multi-layer, tracker-based\
    \ P2P scheme described at the workshop\n   is a generic example of an architecture\
    \ that demonstrates how\n   localization may be useful in principle.\n   In a\
    \ traditional, tracker-based P2P system, trackers provide clients\n   with information\
    \ about seeds and peers where clients can find the\n   content they seek.  A multi-layered\
    \ tracker architecture incorporates\n   additional \"local\" trackers that provide\
    \ the same information, but\n   only for content located within their own local\
    \ network scope.\n   Client queries are re-directed from the global tracker to\
    \ the\n   appropriate local trackers.  Local trackers may also exist on\n   multiple\
    \ levels, in which case queries would be further re-directed.\n   This sort of\
    \ architecture could also serve hybrid P2P/content\n   delivery networks, where\
    \ the global tracker functions as both a\n   tracker and a content server, and\
    \ local trackers track locally\n   provisioned caches in addition to seeds and\
    \ peers.\n   One challenge in this architecture is determining what \"local\"\
    \ means\n   for trackers, seeds, and peers.  Locality could be dependent on\n\
    \   traffic conditions, load balancing, static topology, policy, or some\n   other\
    \ metric.  These same considerations would also be crucial for\n   determining\
    \ appropriate cache placement in a hybrid network.\n   This architecture presents\
    \ in the abstract the problem of re-\n   directing from a global entity to a local\
    \ entity.  Client queries\n   need to find their way to the appropriate local\
    \ tracker.  This can be\n   accomplished through an off-path, explicit mechanism\
    \ where local\n   trackers register with the global tracker in advance, or through\
    \ an\n   on-path approach where the network proxies P2P requests.  The off-\n\
    \   path tracker format approach is preferable for performance and\n   reliability\
    \ reasons.\n   Inasmuch as the multi-layer scheme might require ISPs to aid peers\
    \ in\n   finding optimal paths to unauthorized copies of copyrighted content,\n\
    \   ISPs may be concerned about the legal liability of participating.\n"
- title: 5.1.4.  ISP-Aided Neighbor Selection
  contents:
  - "5.1.4.  ISP-Aided Neighbor Selection\n   ISPs have a lot of knowledge about their\
    \ networks: everything from\n   the bandwidth, geography, and service class of\
    \ particular nodes to\n   overarching routing policies, OSPF and BGP metrics,\
    \ and distances to\n   peering points.  The ISP-aided neighbor selection service\
    \ described\n   below seeks to leverage this knowledge without requiring ISPs\
    \ to\n   reveal any information that could not already be discerned through\n\
    \   reverse-engineering by client applications.\n   The service consists of an\
    \ \"oracle\" hosted by an ISP.  The oracle\n   receives a list of IP addresses\
    \ from a network node, sorts the list\n   according to its own confidential criteria,\
    \ and returns the sorted\n   list to the node.  The peer ranking provided by the\
    \ oracle could be\n   viewed as a special case of the virtual cost interface described\
    \ in\n   the previous section.\n   This service could be used by P2P clients or\
    \ trackers, or by any\n   other application that would benefit from learning its\
    \ ISP's\n   connection preferences.  The oracle could be run as a web server or\n\
    \   UDP service at a known location (perhaps similar to BIND).\n   For interdomain\
    \ ranking, an ISP could rank its own peers first, or it\n   could base its ranking\
    \ on the AS number of the IPs in the provided\n   list.  Another option would\
    \ be for multiple ISPs to work together to\n   have their oracles exchange lists\
    \ with each other.\n   The main challenge in implementing the oracle service is\
    \ scalability.\n   If peers need to communicate to the oracle the IP address of\
    \ every\n   peer they know, the size of oracle requests may be inordinately\n\
    \   large.  Additionally, today's largest swarms approach 10000 peers,\n   and\
    \ with every peer requesting a sorted list, the oracle request\n   volume will\
    \ swell.  With the growth of business models dependent upon\n   P2P for distribution\
    \ of content, swarms in the future may be far\n   larger, further exacerbating\
    \ the problem.  Potential mitigations\n   include having trackers, instead of\
    \ peers, issue oracle requests, and\n   using other peers' sorted lists as input,\
    \ rather than always using an\n   unsorted list.\n   On the other hand, this approach\
    \ is advantageous from a legal\n   liability perspective, because it does not\
    \ require ISPs to have any\n   knowledge of where particular content might be\
    \ located or to have any\n   role in directing peers to particular content.\n"

    \  may help to ease network load by reducing the need for peers to\n   upload\
    \ to each other and by localizing traffic.\n   The two main concerns about P2P\
    \ caches relate to network capacity and\n   legal liability.  For caches to be\
    \ useful, they will likely need to\n   be large (one suggestion was that a 1 TB\
    \ cache could service 30% of\n   requests within a single AS, and a 100 TB cache\
    \ could service 80% of\n   requests).  Large caches will require sizable bandwidth\
    \ in order to\n   avoid contention among peers.  Caches would not be usefully\
    \ placed\n   within an HFC network on a cable system, for example.\n   The legal\
    \ liability attached to hosting a P2P cache likely reduces\n   the incentives\
    \ to do so.  Even under legal regimes where liability\n   for caching may be unclear,\

- title: 5.2.2.  Weighted Congestion Control
  contents:
  - "5.2.2.  Weighted Congestion Control\n   Congestion control has typically been\
    \ implemented at a protocol level\n   as an optional, cooperative effort between\
    \ endpoints experiencing\n   congestion, but in looking for a long-term approach\
    \ to congestion\n   control, we may need a more rigorous way for available bandwidth\
    \ to\n   be allocated by and between the hosts using a network.  The idea\n  \
    \ behind weighted congestion control is to allow hosts to give more\n   weight\
    \ to interactive applications during times of congestion.\n   Comparing such an\
    \ approach with Diffserv showcases its strengths and\n   weaknesses.  Unlike Diffserv,\
    \ weighted congestion control could be\n   implemented on hosts with a simple\
    \ extension to socket APIs (although\n   consensus among OSes would be necessary\
    \ for portability).  Through\n   weighted congestion control, control resides\
    \ with the host, whereas\n   even when Diffserv APIs are available, it is difficult\
    \ for a host to\n   know that the network is complying with its classifications.\
    \  With\n   weighted congestion control, hosts need some disincentive to setting\n\
    \   their weights at maximum levels, whereas Diffserv was not designed\n   for\
    \ individual users to employ.  Both approaches must rely on traffic\n   senders\
    \ to set policies, meaning that the congestion issues stemming\n   from P2P use\
    \ on the receiver side are not aided by either mechanism.\n   With Diffserv, a\
    \ light user may waste his or her priority connecting\n   to a heavy user on another\
    \ network, which is not a problem with host-\n   controlled weighting.\n   Weighted\
    \ congestion control is just one example of a generalized set\n   of features\
    \ that characterize useful approaches to congestion\n   control.  These characteristics\
    \ include full user control of\n   priorities within a user's own scope and no\
    \ possibility of\n   interpreting ISP behavior as discriminatory.  The former\
    \ means that\n   ISPs should not override user decisions arbitrarily (though this\
    \ does\n   not preclude an ISP from offering prioritization as an option).  The\n\
    \   latter means that the metric for decision-making needs to obviate\n   suspicion\
    \ of ISP motivations.\n   One metric that meets these criteria is a harm (cost)\
    \ metric, where\n   cost is equal to the amount of data that was not served to\
    \ its\n   destination.  Using this metric, cost is greatest when traffic peaks\n\
    \   are greatest.  It allows for a policy of not sending too much data\n   during\
    \ times of congestion, without specifying exactly how much is\n   too much.  The\
    \ cost metric could be used either for a Diffserv\n   approach or for weighted\
    \ congestion control.\n   One important limitation on ISPs from a congestion-control\n\
    \   perspective is that they do not have a window into congestion on\n   other\
    \ ISPs' networks.  Solving this problem requires a separate\n   mechanism to express\
    \ congestion across domains.\n   One potential avenue for the IETF or IRTF to\
    \ pursue would be to\n   establish a long-term design team to assess congestion\
    \ problems in\n   general and the long-term effects of any proposed quick fixes.\
    \  These\n   issues are not necessarily confined to P2P and should be viewed in\n\

- title: 5.3.  Quality of Service
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Quality of Service\n   Although ISPs have implemented a wide variety of\
    \ short-term\n   approaches to dealing with congestion, several of these may not\
    \ be\n   viable in the long term.  For example, some ISPs have found that\n  \
    \ using deep packet inspection to change the delivery characteristics\n   of certain\
    \ traffic at times of congestion is more cost effective than\n   adding additional\
    \ bandwidth.  Over time, this approach could lead to\n   a cat-and-mouse game\
    \ where applications providers continually adapt\n   to avoid being correctly\
    \ classified by Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)\n   equipment.  Similarly, ISPs implementing\
    \ traffic analysis to identify\n   P2P traffic may find that, in the long run,\
    \ the overhead required of\n   an effective classification scheme will be excessive.\n\
    \   Quality of service (QoS) arrangements may be more suitable in the\n   long\
    \ term.  One approach that distinguishes certain classes of\n   traffic during\
    \ times of congestion was described in Section 3.3.  A\n   standardized mechanism\
    \ that may be useful for implementing QoS is\n   Differentiated Services Code\
    \ Points (DSCP) [RFC2474].\n   With DSCP, devices at the edge of the network mark\
    \ packets with the\n   service level they should receive.  Nodes within the network\
    \ do not\n   need to remember anything about service flows, and applications do\n\
    \   not need to request a particular service level.  Users effectively\n   avoid\
    \ self-interference through service classification.\n   Although DSCP may have\
    \ many uses, perhaps the most relevant to the\n   P2P congestion issue is its\
    \ ability to facilitate usage-based\n   charging.  User pricing agreements that\
    \ charge a premium for real-\n   time traffic and best-effort traffic could potentially\
    \ shape user\n   behavior, resulting in reduced congestion (although ISPs would\
    \ need a\n   mechanism to mitigate the risk of charging subscribers for things\n\
    \   like unintentional malware downloads or DoS attacks).  DSCP could\n   also\
    \ be used to limit a user's supply of high-priority bandwidth,\n   resulting in\
    \ a similar effect.\n   Equipment to support DSCP is already available.  Although\
    \ there has\n   been some concern about a perceived lack of DSCP deployment, it\
    \ is\n   widely used by enterprise customers, and growth has been strong due\n\
    \   to uptake in VoIP at the enterprise level.\n   However, DSCP still faces deployment\
    \ hurdles on many networks.\n   Perhaps the largest barrier of all to wide deployment\
    \ is the lack of\n   uniform code points to be used across networks.  For example,\
    \ the\n   latest Windows Vista API marks voice traffic as CS7, above the\n   priority\
    \ reserve for router traffic.  To properly take advantage of\n   this change,\
    \ every switch will need to re-mark all traffic.  In\n   addition, disparate ISPs\
    \ are currently without a means of verifying\n   each others' markings and thus\

  - "6.  Applications Opening Multiple TCP Connections\n   The workshop discussions\

    \ one link, TCP flow\n   fairness gives users with multiple open connections a\
    \ larger\n   proportion of bandwidth.  Since some P2P protocols use multiple open\n\

    \ other applications that open multiple\n   connections.  A single user with multiple\

    \   P2P traffic issues.\n   On one hand, bandwidth costs may be significant, even\
    \ when viewed in\n   isolation from congestion issues.  Some estimates put the\
    \ total cost\n   of shipping 1 GB between $0.10 and $2.  The cost of transit bandwidth\n\
    \   in markets where subscribers are charged flat rates appears to have\n   leveled\
    \ off and may no longer be getting cheaper.  Thus, it may be\n   reasonable to\
    \ expect more service providers to move to volume-based\n   pricing (where they\
    \ have not already done so) as a means to control\n   congestion and increase\
    \ revenues.  This is only feasible if bandwidth\n   consumption is visible to\
    \ end users, which argues for some mechanism\n   of exposing quotas and usage\
    \ to applications.  However, expressing\n   cost information may be outside of\
    \ the technical purview of the IETF.\n   On the other hand, congestion can be\
    \ viewed merely as a manifestation\n   of cost.  An ISP that invests in capacity\
    \ could be considered to be\n   paying to relieve congestion.  Or, if subscribers\
    \ are charged for\n   congesting the network, then cost and congestion could be\
    \ viewed as\n   one and the same.  The distinction between them may thus be\n\

    \ for\n   information sharing between networks and applications to help improve\n\
    \   peer selection.  Adding to the appeal of this topic is its potential\n   utility\
    \ for applications other than P2P that may also benefit from\n   information about\
    \ the network.  Because the scope of potential\n   solutions discussed at the\
    \ workshop was broad, extracting out the\n   most feasible pieces to pursue is\
    \ the necessary first step.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   The workshop discussions covered a range of potential\
    \ engineering\n   activities, each with its own security considerations.  For\
    \ example,\n   if networks are to provide preference or topology information to\n\
    \   applications, the applications may desire some means of verifying the\n  \
    \ authenticity of the information.  As the IETF community begins to\n   pursue\
    \ specific avenues arising out of this workshop, addressing\n   relevant security\
    \ requirements will be crucial.\n"
