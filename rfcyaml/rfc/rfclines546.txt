The TENEX load average is a measure of CPU demand.
The load average is an average of the number of runable processes over a given time period.
For example, an hourly load average of 10 would mean that (for a single CPU system) at any time during that hour one could expect to see 1 process running and 9 others ready to run (i.e., not blocked for I/O) waiting for the CPU.
The data for BBN and ISI was chosen for presentation in this RFC because the BBN and ISI TENEXs are two of the major time sharing service hosts on the network.
