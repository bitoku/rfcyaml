  - "Abstract\n   To allow connectivity between the General Switched Telephone Network\n\
    \   facsimile service (GSTN fax) and the e-mail-based Internet Fax\n   service\
    \ (i-fax) an \"Internet Fax Gateway\" is required.  This document\n   provides\
    \ recommendations for the functionality of Internet Fax\n   Gateways.  In this\
    \ context, an \"offramp gateway\" provides facsimile\n   data transmission from\
    \ i-fax to GSTN fax; vice versa, an \"onramp\n   gateway\" provides data transmission\
    \ form GSTN fax to i-fax.  The\n   recommendations in this document apply to the\
    \ integrated service\n   including Internet Fax terminals, computers with i-fax\
    \ software on\n   the Internet, and GSTN Fax terminals on the GSTN.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   An Internet Fax Gateway provides connectivity and translation\
    \ between\n   the General Switched Telephone Network facsimile service (GSTN fax)\n\
    \   and the e-mail-based Internet Fax service (i-fax).  This document\n   defines\
    \ the recommended behavior of an Internet Fax Gateway.  An\n   Internet Fax Gateway\
    \ can be classified as \"onramp\", when a facsimile\n   is transferred from GSTN\
    \ fax to the Internet Fax, and as \"offramp\",\n   when a facsimile is transferred\
    \ from Internet Fax to GSTN fax.  For a\n   more detailed definition of \"onramp\"\
    \ and \"offramp\" within i-fax\n   service, see [1].\n   This document provides\
    \ recommendations only for the specific case\n   hereunder:\n   1) the operational\
    \ mode of the Internet Fax is \"store and forward\",\n      as defined in Section\
    \ 2.5 of [1].\n   2) The format of image data is the data format defined by \"\
    simple\n      mode\" in [4].\n   This document does not apply to the gateway functions\
    \ for \"real-time\n   Internet Fax\", as described and defined in [3].  Additional\n\
    \   recommendations for optional functionality are described in [24].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Key Words
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Key Words\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"\
    MAY\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [5].\n"
- title: 2.  Internet Fax Gateway Operations
  contents:
  - "2.  Internet Fax Gateway Operations\n   An onramp gateway receives a facsimile\
    \ from a GSTN fax device (which\n   may include an offramp gateway itself), and\
    \ generates an Internet Fax\n   over the Internet, which is sent to any Internet\
    \ Fax device.\n   An offramp gateway receives an Internet Fax over the Internet\
    \ from\n   any Internet Fax-capable device (which may include an onramp gateway\n\
    \   or a PC), and generates a GSTN fax, which is sent to any GSTN fax\n   device.\n\
    \   In both of these cases, the Internet side of the gateway acts as an\n   Internet\
    \ Fax device, as described in [4], while the GSTN side of the\n   gateway acts\
    \ as a GSTN fax device, as described in [6].\n   In this document we will only\
    \ thus recommend the actions that occur\n   while\n   1) the onramp gateway converts\
    \ a fax received from GSTN and forwards\n      it to the Internet Fax service;\n\
    \   2) the offramp gateway converts a fax received from the Internet and\n   \
    \   forwards it to the GSTN fax service.\n"
- title: 3.  The Offramp Gateway Operations
  contents:
  - "3.  The Offramp Gateway Operations\n   An offramp gateway MUST, as a minimal\
    \ requirement, perform the\n   following functions:\n      - address translation/mapping,\n\
    \      - image format conversion, and\n      - error/return notification handling\n\
    \   and MAY also perform\n      - user authorization.\n"
- title: 3.1.  User Authorization
  contents:
  - "3.1.  User Authorization\n   An offramp gateway MAY have a user authorization\
    \ function to confirm\n   that a user is allowed to transmit its Internet Fax\
    \ to the GSTN fax\n   service.\n   Because an Internet Fax is sent as a MIME e-mail\
    \ message to the\n   offramp gateway, digital signatures can be used to authenticate\
    \ and\n   authorize the user.  S/MIME is one example of a protocol that\n   includes\
    \ digital signature services.  S/MIME is described in\n   [9][10][11][12][13].\
    \  Other methods of adding a digital signature to\n   a mail message (such as\
    \ OpenPGP [17] [25]) MAY also be used to\n   authenticate and authorize the user.\n\
    \   The agent sending the Internet Fax (which may include an onramp\n   gateway)\
    \ sends the digitally-signed S/MIME or OpenPGP Fax message to\n   the offramp\
    \ gateway.  The offramp gateway then compares the\n   credentials of the user\
    \ to determine if he/she is authorized to send\n   faxes to the GSTN fax service.\
    \  If the authorization process fails,\n   then the offramp gateway MUST generate\
    \ an error delivery notification\n   for the sender of the Internet Fax.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Addressing
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Addressing\n   An Internet Fax may contain multiple e-mail addresses, both\
    \ as\n   originators, and as recipients.  For its forwarding function to GSTN\n\
    \   fax service, an offramp gateway MUST only consider those addresses\n   which\
    \ are explicitly itself, i.e., those where the right-hand side of\n   the e-mail\
    \ address corresponds to the offramp gateway.\n   Because addresses on the Internet\
    \ Fax service are e-mail addresses,\n   in order to reach a destination in the\
    \ GSTN fax service, the offramp\n   gateway MUST convert e-mail addresses into\
    \ GSTN addresses.\n   The GSTN destination address SHOULD normally be encoded\
    \ inside the\n   left-hand side of the e-mail address, according to [7].  However,\
    \ an\n   offramp gateway MAY use locally implemented translation rules to map\n\
    \   left-hand side strings into GSTN addresses.\n   In any case, the offramp gateway\
    \ MUST process the resultant GSTN\n   address and convert it to a \"local-phone\"\
    , in accordance with local\n   dialing rules.\n   \"Global-phone\" is defined\
    \ in Section 2 of [7].  \"Local-phone\" is\n   defined in Section 2 of [8].  \"\
    Exit-code\" is defined in Section 2.1\n   of [8].\n   The offramp gateway SHOULD\
    \ also have a function to apply translation\n   to originator addresses and other\
    \ addresses referred to into the\n   Internet Fax, in order to ensure a possible\
    \ return path from GSTN fax\n   service to Internet Fax destinations, including\
    \ other offramp\n   gateways.  These functions MUST be compliant with the address\n\
    \   handling of onramp gateways that is described in Section 4.2 of this\n   document.\n"

  - "3.2.1.  Examples of Local Dialing Rules Applied to GSTN Destination\n       \
    \ Addresses\n   The first example shows how an offramp gateway converts a \"global-\n\
    \   phone\" to a \"local-phone\" by removing the \"+\" and \"44\" (recognizing\n\
    \   the international country code is local), and then knowing it can\n   dial\
    \ directly without an exit-code:\n      global-phone:  +441164960348\n   resulting\

    \ \"+\" and \"44\" (recognizing\n   the international country code is local),\
    \ and then adding the exit-\n   code \"0\" in front of the string:\n      global-phone:\

    \ of the string:\n      global-phone:   +441164960348\n   resulting in:\n    \
    \  local-phone:    01164960348\n   The last example shows how an offramp gateway\
    \ converts a \"global-\n   phone\" to a \"local-phone\" by removing the \"+\"\
    , recognizing the\n   international country code is non-local, and adding the\
    \ local\n   international dialing prefix \"00\" in front of the string:\n    \
    \  global-phone:   +441164960348\n   resulting in:\n      local-phone:   00441164960348\n"

    \  If a subaddress is\n   encoded into the left-hand side of the e-mail address\
    \ [7], then it\n   MUST be used by the offramp gateway, as specified in T.33 [15],\
    \ to\n   reach the final GSTN fax recipient.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Image Format Conversion\n   An offramp gateway MUST convert the file format\
    \ from TIFF Profile-S\n   for Internet Fax (defined in [16]) into the GSTN fax\

    \ document.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Error/Return Notification Handling
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Error/Return Notification Handling\n   An offramp gateway SHOULD have a\
    \ function that allows it to send a\n   return notice to the originator Internet\
    \ Fax device (defined in [4])\n   when a transmission error occurs over the GSTN\
    \ fax service and the\n   facsimile is not delivered to the destination.  The\
    \ return notice\n   MUST be in Message Delivery Notification (MDN) format and\
    \ delivered\n   by the offramp gateway over the Internet e-mail transport service\n\
    \   used by Internet Fax.  The MDN disposition-type MUST be set as\n   \"processed\"\
    , and the disposition-modifier MUST be set as an \"error\".\n   If the offramp\
    \ gateway fails to transmit the MDN, the error\n   information MAY be recorded\
    \ to a log, and processing MAY end, or the\n   administrator of the gateway system\
    \ MAY be notified of these errors\n   through a specific method (for example,\
    \ by an e-mail message).\n   The more complex case of Delivery Status Notification\
    \ (DSN) requests\n   handling is not considered in this document.\n"

    \  and MAY also perform\n   - user authorization.\n"
- title: 4.1.  User Authorization
  contents:
  - "4.1.  User Authorization\n   An onramp gateway MAY have a user authorization\
    \ function to confirm\n   that the user is authorized to transmit a facsimile\
    \ to the Internet\n   fax service.  For example, user authorization may be accomplished\
    \ by\n   getting a user-ID and password received by Dual Tone Multi-Frequency\n\
    \   (DTMF), or via a local authorization table based on the GSTN caller-\n   ID.\n\
    \   If the authorization process fails, then the onramp gateway MUST\n   generate\
    \ an error message/code for the sender of the GSTN Fax.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Address Translation/Mapping
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Address Translation/Mapping\n   Addresses on Internet Fax service are e-mail\
    \ addresses, thus a\n   recipient of an Internet Fax might be either an e-mail\
    \ user, an\n   Internet Fax device with its own recipients/users, or an offramp\n\
    \   gateway.  The onramp gateway SHOULD have a functionality in order to\n   receive\
    \ from GSTN (via DTMF) destination addresses.  However, there\n   are two categories\
    \ of destination addresses:\n      - e-mail users and Internet Fax recipient/users\n\
    \      - real GSTN addresses reached via an offramp gateway\n   We define \"indirect\
    \ address mapping\" as the functionality for the\n   first category, and \"direct\
    \ address mapping\" as the functionality for\n   the second category.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Indirect Address Mapping
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Indirect Address Mapping\n   The onramp gateway MAY implement local address\
    \ mapping mechanisms\n   (via a table, directory lookup, or something similar)\
    \ that permit\n   translation from addresses (called \"indirect address numbers\"\
    )\n   received from the GSTN fax sending device into e-mail addresses.  A\n  \
    \ single e-mail address or a list of e-mail addresses MAY correspond to\n   a\
    \ single indirect address number.\n   Here is one mapping example:\n   (1) An\
    \ onramp gateway receives the indirect address number \"1234\"\n       from the\
    \ source GSTN facsimile by DTMF.\n            1234\n   (2) The destination address\
    \ is looked up in the address mapping\n       table.\n            address mapping\
    \ table\n            1234 : ifax@example.com\n   (3) An Internet Fax is sent to\
    \ the address (\"addr-spec\")\n            ifax@example.com\n   \"Addr-spec\"\
    \ is defined in Section 3.4.1 of [14].\n   If the address mapping lookup fails,\
    \ an error MUST be reported to the\n   originating GSTN fax device.\n"
- title: 4.2.2.  Direct Address Mapping
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Direct Address Mapping\n   If the indirect address mapping specified\
    \ in 4.2.1 is not\n   implemented, then only \"direct address mapping\" can be\
    \ used.  The\n   GSTN sending device SHOULD send the full numeric destination\
    \ address\n   to the onramp gateway via DTMF.  Direct address mapping can also\
    \ be\n   used if indirect address mapping is implemented.\n   An example:\n  \
    \ (1) An onramp gateway receives the destination telephone number\n       \"441164960348\"\
    \ from the source facsimile by DTMF.\n            441164960348\n   (2) The destination\
    \ number is encoded as a \"global-phone\", so \"+\" is\n       added to the head\
    \ of the string.\n            +441164960348\n   (3) \"FAX=\" is added in order\
    \ to build the \"fax-mbox\" address item\n            FAX=+441164960348\n   (4)\
    \ The destination address is completed, adding the specification of\n       the\

    \ of the fax message to a global-phone address.\n            FAX=+441164960348@example.com\n\
    \   The procedure for choosing the domain name of an offramp gateway is\n   defined\

    \ and encode\n   it as the sender of the Internet Fax, using the direct address\n\
    \   mapping (see Section 4.2.2 of this document).  The sender address\n   SHOULD\
    \ be completed using the onramp gateway address, unless the\n   onramp gateway\
    \ has additional information with which to specify a\n   different return path.\n\
    \   If the onramp gateway does not have any sender address information,\n   the\

  contents:
  - "4.6.  Return Notice Handling\n   When an onramp gateway receives and analyzes\
    \ a return notice from the\n   Internet Fax destination, it MAY have the functionality\
    \ to send the\n   delivery status to a suitable facsimile device on the GSTN through\
    \ an\n   appropriate offramp gateway.  The generated notice sent via GSTN fax\n\
    \   SHOULD contain both the human-readable notice information, and the\n   original\
    \ delivery codes.\n   If the onramp gateway fails in the transmission of the return\
    \ notice\n   back to GSTN fax service, the information MAY be recorded into a\
    \ log,\n   and processing MAY end.  As an alternate, the administrator of the\n\
    \   gateway system MAY be notified of this notice with a specific method\n   (for\
    \ example, by sending an e-mail message to a mailbox).\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Refer to Section 3.1 (\"User Authorization\"\
    ) for authentication for an\n   offramp gateway.  OpenPGP [17] [25] can be used\
    \ to provide\n   authorization services instead of S/MIME.  Refer to Section 4.1\n\
    \   (\"User Authorization\") for authentication for an onramp gateway.\n   S/MIME\
    \ and OpenPGP can also be used to encrypt a message.  A signed\n   or encrypted\
    \ message is protected while transported along the\n   network; however, when\
    \ a message reaches an Internet Fax Gateway,\n   either onramp or offramp, this\
    \ kind of protection cannot be applied\n   anymore.  Here, security must rely\
    \ on trusted operations of the\n   gateway itself.  A gateway might have its own\
    \ certificate/key to\n   improve security operations when sending Internet Faxes,\
    \ but, as with\n   any gateway, it breaks the end-to-end security pattern of both\
    \ S/MIME\n   and PGP.\n   Other security mechanisms, like IPsec [18][19][20][21][2]\
    \ or TLS [23]\n   also do not ensure a secure gateway operation.\n   Denial-of-service\
    \ attacks are beyond the scope of this document.\n   Host compromise caused by\
    \ flaws in the implementation is beyond the\n   scope of this document.\n"
