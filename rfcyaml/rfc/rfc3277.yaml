  - "1. Introduction\n   When an IS-IS router that was previously a transit router\
    \ becomes\n   unavailable as a result of some transient condition such as a reboot,\n\
    \   other routers within the routing domain must select an alternative\n   path\
    \ to reach destinations which have previously transited the failed\n   router.\
    \  Presumably, the newly selected router(s) comprising the path\n   have been\
    \ available for some time and, as a result, have complete\n   forwarding information\
    \ bases (FIBs) which contain a full set of\n   reachability information for both\
    \ internal and external (e.g., BGP)\n   destination networks.\n   When the previously\
    \ failed router becomes available again, it is only\n   seconds before the paths\
    \ that had previously transited the router are\n   again selected as the optimal\
    \ path by the IGP.  As a result,\n   forwarding tables are updated and packets\
    \ are once again forwarded\n   along the path.  Unfortunately, external destination\
    \ reachability\n   information (e.g., learned via BGP) is not yet available to\
    \ the\n   router, and as a result, packets bound for destinations not learned\n\
    \   via the IGP are unnecessarily discarded.\n   A simple interoperable mechanism\
    \ to alleviate the offshoot associated\n   with this deterministic behavior is\
    \ discussed below.\n"

    \ can be\n   employed in IS-IS [1, 2] networks in order to avoid transition to\
    \ a\n   newly available path until other associated routing protocols such as\n\
    \   BGP have had sufficient time to converge.\n   The benefits of such a mechanism\
    \ can be realized when considering the\n   following scenario depicted in Figure\

    \                      S.1\n                 Figure 1: Example Network Topology\n\
    \   Host S.1 is transmitting data to destination D.1 via a primary path\n   of\
    \ RtrA->RtrB->RtrD.  Routers A, B and C learn of reachability to\n   destination\
    \ D.1 via BGP from RtrD.  RtrA's primary path to D.1 is\n   selected because when\
    \ calculating the path to BGP NEXT_HOP of RtrD,\n   the sum of the IS-IS link\
    \ metrics on the RtrA-RtrB-RtrD path is less\n   than the sum of the metrics of\
    \ the RtrA-RtrC-RtrD path.\n   Assume RtrB becomes unavailable and as a result\
    \ the RtrC path to RtrD\n   is used.  Once RtrA's FIB is updated and it begins\
    \ forwarding packets\n   to RtrC, everything should behave properly as RtrC has\
    \ existing\n   forwarding information regarding destination D.1's availability\
    \ via\n   BGP NEXT_HOP RtrD.\n   Assume now that RtrB comes back online.  In only\
    \ a few seconds, IS-IS\n   neighbor state has been established with RtrA and RtrD\
    \ and database\n   synchronization has occurred.  RtrA now realizes that the best\
    \ path\n   to destination D.1 is via RtrB, and therefore updates it FIB\n   appropriately.\
    \  RtrA begins to forward packets destined to D.1 to\n   RtrB.  Though, because\
    \ RtrB has yet to establish and synchronize its\n   BGP neighbor relationship\
    \ and routing information with RtrD, RtrB has\n   no knowledge regarding reachability\
    \ of destination D.1, and therefore\n   discards the packets received from RtrA\
    \ destined to D.1.\n   If RtrB were to temporarily set its LSP Overload bit while\n\
    \   synchronizing BGP tables with its neighbors, RtrA would continue to\n   use\
    \ the working RtrA->RtrC->RtrD path, and the LSP should only be\n   used to obtain\
    \ reachability to locally connected networks (rather\n   than for calculating\
    \ transit paths through the router, as defined in\n   [1]).\n   However, it should\
    \ be noted that when RtrB goes away, its LSP is\n   still present in the IS-IS\
    \ databases of all other routers in the\n   routing domain.  When RtrB comes back\
    \ it establishes adjacencies.  As\n   soon as its neighbors have an adjacency\
    \ with RtrB, they will\n   advertise their new adjacency in their new LSP.  The\
    \ result is that\n   all the other routers will receive new LSPs from RtrA and\
    \ RtrD\n   containing the RtrB adjacency, even though RtrB is still completing\n\
    \   its synchronization and therefore has not yet sent its new LSP.\n   At this\
    \ time SPF is computed and everyone will include RtrB in their\n   tree since\
    \ they will use the old version of RtrB LSP (the new one has\n   not yet arrived).\
    \  Once RtrB has finished establishing all its\n   adjacencies, it will then regenerate\
    \ its LSP and flood it.  Then all\n   other routers within the domain will finally\
    \ compute SPF with the\n   correct information.  Only at that time will the Overload\
    \ bit be\n   taken into account.\n   As such, it is recommended that each time\
    \ a router establishes an\n   adjacency, it will update its LSP and flood it immediately,\
    \ even\n   before beginning database synchronization.  This will allow for the\n\
    \   Overload bit setting to propagate immediately, and remove the\n   potential\
    \ for an older version of the reloaded routers LSP to be\n   used.\n   After synchronization\
    \ of BGP tables with neighboring routers (or\n   expiry of some other timer or\
    \ trigger), RtrB would generate a new\n   LSP, clearing the Overload bit, and\
    \ RtrA could again begin using the\n   optimal path via RtrB.\n   Typically, in\
    \ service provider networks IBGP connections are done via\n   peerings with 'loopback'\
    \ addresses.  As such, the newly available\n   router must advertise its own loopback\
    \ (or similar) IP address, as\n   well as associated adjacencies, in order to\
    \ make the loopbacks\n   accessible to other routers within the routing domain.\
    \  It is because\n   of this that simply flooding an empty LSP is not sufficient.\n"
- title: 3. Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Deployment Considerations\n   Such a mechanism increases overall network availability\
    \ and allows\n   network operators to alleviate the deterministic blackholing\
    \ behavior\n   introduced in this scenario.  Similar mechanisms [3] have been\n\
    \   defined for OSPF, though only after realizing the usefulness obtained\n  \
    \ from that of the IS-IS Overload bit technique.\n   This mechanism has been deployed\
    \ in several large IS-IS networks for\n   a number of years.\n   Triggers for\
    \ setting the Overload bit as described are left to the\n   implementer.  Some\
    \ potential triggers could perhaps include \"N\n   seconds after booting\", or\
    \ \"N number of BGP prefixes in the BGP Loc-\n   RIB\".\n   Unlike similar mechanisms\
    \ employed in [3], if the Overload bit is set\n   in a router's LSP, NO transit\
    \ paths are calculated through the\n   router.  As such, if no alternative paths\
    \ are available to the\n   destination network, employing such a mechanism may\
    \ actually have a\n   negative impact on convergence (i.e., the router maintains\
    \ the only\n   available path to reach downstream routers, but the Overload bit\n\
    \   disallows other nodes in the network from calculating paths via the\n   router,\
    \ and as such, no feasible path exists to the routers).\n   Finally, if all systems\
    \ within an IS-IS routing domain haven't\n   implemented the Overload bit correctly,\
    \ forwarding loops may occur.\n"
- title: 4. Potential Alternatives
  contents:
  - "4. Potential Alternatives\n   Alternatively, it may be considered more appealing\
    \ to employ\n   something more akin to [3] for this purpose.  With this model,\
    \ during\n   transient conditions a node advertises excessively high link metrics\n\
    \   to serve as an indication, to other nodes in the network that paths\n   transiting\
    \ the router are \"less desirable\" than existing paths.\n   The advantage of\
    \ a metric-based mechanism over the Overload bit\n   mechanism model proposed\
    \ here is that transit paths may still be\n   calculated through the router. \
    \ Another advantage is that a metric-\n   based mechanism does not require that\
    \ all nodes in the IS-IS domain\n   correctly implement the Overload bit.\n  \
    \ However, as currently deployed, IS-IS provides for only 6 bits of\n   space\
    \ for link metric allocation, and 10 bits aggregate path metric.\n   Though extensions\
    \ proposed in [4] remove this limitation, they have\n   not yet been widely deployed.\
    \  As such, there's currently little\n   flexibility when using link metrics for\
    \ this purpose.  Of course,\n   both methods proposed in this document are backwards-compatible.\n"
