    \ and NIC idents:\n      [Users:] sender ident/addressee ident(s)@NIC\n   e.g.\
    \ \"JEW/DHC MAP@NIC\". To send to a group, use group ident, e.g.\n   \"JEW/NLG@NIC\"\
    . To combine Journal SNDMSG with SNDMSG to others, add\n   others' Network addresses\
    \ after commas, e.g. \"JEW/DHC@NIC,PRATT@ISI\".\n   See ARPANET Directory for\
