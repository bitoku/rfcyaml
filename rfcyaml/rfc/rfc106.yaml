    \ HOST QUESTIONNAIRE\n        The answer to a number of questions about the characteristics\n\
    and operation of Network HOSTS will be useful to implementers of some\nearly versions\
    \ of TELNET, and/or to the USER/SERVER SITE PROTOCOL\nCommittee in their consideration\
    \ of a full TELNET PROTOCOL\nspecification.\n        Questions of current interest\
    \ are covered on the attached\nquestionnaire.  The Technical Liaison contact at\
    \ each HOST site is asked\nto review these questions and fill in the answers as\
    \ soon as convenient\nafter receipt.\n        One of the members of the committee\
    \ listed below will contact\neach HOST site by telephone in the next few days\
    \ to record the answers.\n   Committee members include:\n         Bob Long   \
    \                SDC\n         John Melvin                SRI/ARC\n         Ed\

    \       Results of the questionnaire will be tabulated and distributed\nas an\
