  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)\n\
    \   [RFC6325] protocol provides loop-free and per-hop-based multipath\n   data\
    \ forwarding with minimum configuration.  TRILL uses IS-IS [IS-IS]\n   [RFC6165]\
    \ [RFC7176] as its control-plane routing protocol and defines\n   a TRILL-specific\
    \ header for user data.  In a TRILL campus,\n   communications between TRILL switches\
    \ can:\n   1) use multiple parallel links and/or paths,\n   2) spread load over\
    \ different links and/or paths at a fine-grained\n      flow level through equal-cost\
    \ multipathing of unicast traffic and\n      multiple distribution trees for multi-destination\
    \ traffic, and\n   3) rapidly reconfigure to accommodate link or node failures\
    \ or\n      additions.\n   To the degree practical, \"active-active\" is the extension\
    \ of similar\n   load spreading and robustness to the connections between end\
    \ stations\n   and the TRILL campus.  Such end stations may have multiple ports\
    \ and\n   will be connected, directly or via bridges, to multiple edge TRILL\n\
    \   switches.  It must be possible, except in some failure conditions, to\n  \
    \ spread end-station traffic load at the granularity of flows across\n   links\
    \ to such multiple edge TRILL switches and rapidly reconfigure to\n   accommodate\
    \ topology changes.\n"

- title: 2.  Target Scenario
  contents:
  - "2.  Target Scenario\n   This section presents a typical scenario of active-active\
    \ connection\n   to a TRILL campus via multiple edge RBridges where the current\
    \ TRILL\n   Appointed Forwarder mechanism does not work as expected.\n   The TRILL\
    \ Appointed Forwarder mechanism [RFC6439] can handle failover\n   (active-standby),\
    \ provides loop avoidance, and, with administrative\n   configuration, provides\
    \ load spreading based on VLAN.  One and only\n   one appointed RBridge can ingress/egress\
    \ native frames into/from the\n   TRILL campus for a given VLAN among all edge\
    \ RBridges connecting a\n   legacy network to the TRILL campus.  This is true\
    \ whether the legacy\n   network is a simple point-to-point link or a complex\
    \ bridged LAN or\n   anything in between.  By carefully selecting different RBridges\
    \ as\n   Appointed Forwarder for different sets of VLANs, load spreading over\n\
    \   different edge RBridges across different Data Labels can be achieved.\n  \
    \ The Appointed Forwarder mechanism [RFC6439] requires all of the edge\n   group\
    \ RBridges to exchange TRILL IS-IS Hello packets through their\n   access ports.\
    \  As Figure 1 shows, when multiple access links of\n   multiple edge RBridges\
    \ are connected to a CE by an LAALP, Hello\n   messages sent by RB1 via access\
    \ port to CE1 will not be forwarded to\n   RB2 by CE1.  RB2 (and other members\
    \ of LAALP1) will not see that\n   Hello from RB1 via the LAALP1.  Every member\
    \ RBridge of LAALP1 thinks\n   of itself as Appointed Forwarder on an LAALP1 link\
    \ for all VLANs and\n   will ingress/egress frames.  Hence, the Appointed Forwarder\
    \ mechanism\n   cannot provide active-active or even active-standby service across\n\
    \   the edge group in such a scenario.\n                   ----------------------\n\

    \ Connection to TRILL Edge RBridges\n   Active-active connection is useful when\
    \ we want to achieve the\n   following two goals:\n   -  Flow-based rather than\
    \ VLAN-based load balancing is desired.\n   -  More rapid failure recovery is\
    \ desired.\n   The current Appointed Forwarder mechanism relies on the TRILL Hello\n\
    \   timer expiration to detect the unreachability of another edge RBridge\n  \
    \ connecting to the same local link.  Then, reappointing the forwarder\n   for\
    \ specific VLANs may be required.  Such procedures take time on the\n   scale\
    \ of seconds although this can be improved with TRILL use of\n   Bidirectional\
    \ Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC7175].  Active-active\n   connection usually\
    \ has a faster built-in mechanism for member node\n   and/or link failure detection.\
    \  Faster detection of failures\n   minimizes the frame loss and recovery time.\n\
    \   Today, LAALP is usually a proprietary facility whose implementation\n   varies\
    \ by vendor.  So, to be sure the LAALP operates successfully\n   across a group\
    \ of edge RBridges, those edge RBridges will almost\n   always have to be from\
    \ the same vendor.  In the case where the LAALP\n   is an MC-LAG, the CE normally\
    \ implements the logic described in IEEE\n   Std 802.1AX-2011 [802.1AX], so proprietary\
    \ elements would only be at\n   the end of the edge group.  There is also a revision\
    \ of IEEE Std\n   802.1AX-2011 [802.1AX] underway (802.1X-REV) to remove the\n\
    \   restriction in IEEE Std 802.1AX-2011 [802.1AX] that there be one box\n   at\
    \ each end of the aggregation.  So it is possible that, in the\n   future, an\
    \ LAALP could be implemented through such a revised IEEE Std\n   802.1AX-2011\
    \ [802.1AX] with standards-conformant logic at the ends of\n   both the CE and\
    \ edge group.  In order to have a common understanding\n   of active-active connection\
    \ scenarios, the assumptions in Section 2.1\n   are made about the characteristics\
    \ of the LAALP and edge group of\n   RBridges.\n"
- title: 2.1.  LAALP and Edge Group Characteristics
  contents:
  - "2.1.  LAALP and Edge Group Characteristics\n   For a CE connecting to multiple\
    \ edge RBridges via an LAALP (active-\n   active connection), the following characteristics\
    \ apply:\n   a) The LAALP will deliver a frame from an end node to TRILL at\n\
    \      exactly one edge group RBridge.\n   b) The LAALP will never forward frames\
    \ it receives from one uplink to\n      another.\n   c) The LAALP will attempt\
    \ to send all frames for a given flow on the\n      same uplink.  To do this,\
    \ it has some unknown rule for which\n      frames get sent to which uplinks (typically\
    \ based on a simple hash\n      function of Layer 2 through 4 header fields).\n\
    \   d) Frames are accepted from any of the uplinks and passed down to end\n  \
    \    nodes (if any exist).\n   e) The LAALP cannot be assumed to send useful control\
    \ information to\n      the uplink such as \"this is the set of other RBridges\
    \ to which\n      this CE is attached\" or \"these are all the MAC addresses\n\
    \      attached\".\n   For an edge group of RBridges to which a CE is multiply\
    \ attached with\n   an LAALP:\n   a) Any two RBridges in the edge group are reachable\
    \ from each other\n      via the TRILL campus.\n   b) Each RBridge in the edge\
    \ group knows an ID for each LAALP instance\n      multiply attached to that group.\
    \  The ID will be consistent across\n      the edge group and globally unique\
    \ across the TRILL campus.  For\n      example, if CE1 attaches to RB1, RB2, ...\
    \ RBn using an LAALP, then\n      each of the RBs will know, for the port to CE1,\
    \ that it has a\n      label such as \"LAALP1\".\n   c) Each RB in the edge group\
    \ can be configured with the set of\n      acceptable VLANs for the ports to any\
    \ CE.  The acceptable VLANs\n      configured for those ports should include all\
    \ the VLANs the CE has\n      joined and be consistent for all the member RBridges\
    \ of the edge\n      group.\n   d) When an RBridge fails, all the other RBridges\
    \ that have formed an\n      LAALP instance with it learn of the failure in a\
    \ timely fashion.\n   e) When a downlink of an edge group RBridge to an LAALP\
    \ instance\n      fails, that RBridge and all the other RBridges participating\
    \ in\n      the LAALP instance, including that downlink, learn of the failure\n\
    \      in a timely fashion.\n   f) The RBridges in the edge group have a mechanism\
    \ to exchange\n      information with each other, information such as the set\
    \ of CEs\n      they are connecting to or the IDs of the LAALP instances their\n\
    \      downlinks are part of.\n   Other than the applicable characteristics above,\
    \ the internals of an\n   LAALP are out of the scope of TRILL.\n"

    \  The topology in Figure 1 is used\n   in the following sub-sections as the example\
    \ scenario for\n   illustration purposes.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Frame Duplications
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Frame Duplications\n   When a remote RBridge ingresses a multi-destination\
    \ TRILL data packet\n   in VLAN x, all edge group RBridges of LAALP1 will receive\
    \ the frame\n   if any local CE1 joins VLAN x.  As each of them thinks it is the\n\
    \   Appointed Forwarder for VLAN x, without changes made for active-\n   active\
    \ connection support, they would all forward the frame to CE1.\n   The bad consequence\
    \ is that CE1 receives multiple copies of that\n   multi-destination frame from\
    \ the remote end-host source.\n   Frame duplication may also occur when an ingress\
    \ RBridge is non-\n   remote -- say, ingress and egress are two RBridges belonging\
    \ to the\n   same edge group.  Assume LAALP m connects to an edge group g, and\
    \ the\n   edge group g consists of RB1, RB2, and RB3.  The multi-destination\n\
    \   frames ingressed from a port not connected to LAALP m by RB1 can be\n   locally\
    \ replicated to other ports on RB1 and also TRILL encapsulated\n   and forwarded\
    \ to RB2 and RB3.  CE1 will receive duplicate copies from\n   RB1, RB2, and RB3.\n\
    \   Note that frame duplication is only a problem in multi-destination\n   frame\
    \ forwarding.  Unicast forwarding does not have this issue as\n   there is only\
    \ ever one copy of the packet.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Loopback
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Loopback\n   As shown in Figure 1, CE1 may send a native multi-destination\
    \ frame\n   to the TRILL campus via a member of the LAALP1 edge group (say RB1).\n\
    \   This frame will be TRILL encapsulated and then forwarded through the\n   campus\
    \ to the multi-destination receivers.  Other members (say RB2)\n   of the same\
    \ LAALP edge group will receive this multicast packet as\n   well.  In this case,\
    \ without changes made for active-active\n   connection support, RB2 will decapsulate\
    \ the frame and egress it.\n   The frame loops back to CE1.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Address Flip-Flop
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Address Flip-Flop\n   Consider RB1 and RB2 using their own nickname as\
    \ ingress nickname for\n   data into a TRILL campus.  As shown in Figure 1, CE1\
    \ may send a data\n   frame with the same VLAN and source Media Access Control\
    \ (MAC)\n   address to any member of the edge group LAALP1.  If an egress RBridge\n\
    \   receives TRILL data packets from different ingress RBridges but with\n   the\
    \ same source Data Label and MAC address, it learns different\n   correspondences\
    \ between a {Data Label and MAC address} and nickname\n   when decapsulating the\
    \ data frames.  Address correspondence may keep\n   flip-flopping among nicknames\
    \ of the member RBridges of the LAALP for\n   the same Data Label and MAC address.\
    \  Existing hardware does not\n   support data-plane learning of multiple nicknames\
    \ for the same MAC\n   address and Data Label -- when data-plane learning indicates\n\
    \   attachment of the MAC address to a new nickname, it overwrites the\n   old\
    \ attachment nickname.\n   Implementers have stated that most current TRILL switch\
    \ hardware,\n   when doing data-plane learning, behaves badly under these\n  \
    \ circumstances and, for example, interprets address flip-flopping as a\n   severe\
    \ network problem.  It may also cause the returning traffic to\n   go through\
    \ different paths to reach the destination, resulting in\n   persistent reordering\
    \ of the frames.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Unsynchronized Information among Member RBridges
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Unsynchronized Information among Member RBridges\n   A local RBridge, say\
    \ RB1 connected to LAALP1, may have learned a\n   correspondence between a {Data\
    \ Label and MAC address} and nickname\n   for a remote host h1 when h1 sends a\
    \ packet to CE1.  The returning\n   traffic from CE1 may go to any other member\
    \ RBridge of LAALP1, for\n   example, RB2.  RB2 may not have h1's correspondence\
    \ between a {Data\n   Label and MAC address} and nickname stored.  Therefore,\
    \ it has to do\n   the flooding for unknown unicast addresses [RFC6325].  Such\
    \ flooding\n   is unnecessary since the returning traffic is almost always expected\n\
    \   and RB1 had learned the address correspondence.  It is desirable to\n   avoid\
    \ flooding; it imposes a greater burden on the network than known\n   destination\
    \ unicast traffic because the flooded traffic is sent over\n   more links.\n \
    \  Synchronization of the correspondence between a {Data Label and MAC\n   address}\
    \ and nickname information among member RBridges will reduce\n   such unnecessary\
    \ flooding.\n"
- title: 4.  High-Level Requirements and Goals for Solutions
  contents:
  - "4.  High-Level Requirements and Goals for Solutions\n   The problems identified\
    \ in Section 3 should be solved in any solution\n   for active-active connection\
    \ to edge RBridges.  The following high-\n   level requirements and goals should\
    \ be met.\n   Data plane:\n   1) All uplinks of a CE MUST be active: the LAALP\
    \ is free to choose\n      any uplink on which to send packets, and the CE is\
    \ able to receive\n      packets from any uplink of an edge group.\n   2) Loopback\
    \ and frame duplication MUST be prevented.\n   3) Learning of correspondence between\
    \ a {Data Label and MAC address}\n      and nickname by a remote RBridge MUST\
    \ NOT flip-flop between the\n      local multiply attached edge RBridges.\n  \
    \ 4) Packets for a flow SHOULD stay in order.\n   5) The Reverse Path Forwarding\
    \ Check MUST work properly as per the\n      RBridges base protocol [RFC6325].\n\
    \   6) Single uplink failure on a CE to an edge group MUST NOT cause\n      persistent\
    \ packet delivery failure between a TRILL campus and CE.\n   Control plane:\n\
    \   1) No requirement for new information to be passed between edge\n      RBridges\
    \ and CEs or between edge RBridges and end nodes exists.\n   2) If there is any\
    \ TRILL-specific information required to be\n      exchanged between RBridges\
    \ in an edge group, for example, Data\n      Labels and MAC addresses binding\
    \ to nicknames, a solution MUST\n      specify the mechanism to perform such exchange\
    \ unless this is\n      handled internal to the LAALP.\n   3) RBridges SHOULD\
    \ be able to discover other members in the same edge\n      group by exchanging\
    \ their LAALP attachment information.\n   Configuration, incremental deployment,\
    \ and others:\n   1) Solution SHOULD require minimal configuration.\n   2) Solution\
    \ SHOULD automatically detect misconfiguration of edge\n      RBridge group.\n\
    \   3) Solution SHOULD support incremental deployment, that is, not\n      require\
