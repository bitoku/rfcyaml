  contents:
  - "3.1. Mobile Node Processing for Registration Requests\n   Whenever the Agent\
    \ Advertisement contains the Challenge extension, if\n   the mobile node does\
    \ not have a security association with the Foreign\n   Agent, then it MUST include\
    \ the Challenge value in a MN-FA Challenge\n   extension to the Registration Request\
    \ message.  If, on the other\n   hand, the mobile node does have a security association\
    \ with the\n   foreign agent, it SHOULD include the Challenge value in its\n \
    \  Registration Request message.\n   If the Mobile Node has a security association\
    \ with the Foreign Agent,\n   it MUST include a Mobile-Foreign Authentication\
    \ extension in its\n   Registration Request message, according to the base Mobile\
    \ IP\n   specification [8].  When the Registration Request contains the MN-FA\n\
    \   Challenge extension specified in section 4, the Mobile-Foreign\n   Authentication\
    \ MUST follow the Challenge extension in the\n   Registration Request.\n   If\
    \ the Mobile Node does not have a security association with the\n   Foreign Agent,\
    \ the Mobile Node MUST include the MN-AAA Authentication\n   extension as defined\
    \ in section 6.  In addition, the Mobile Node\n   SHOULD include the NAI extension\
    \ [2], to enable the foreign agent to\n   make use of any available verification\
    \ infrastructure.  The SPI field\n   of the MN-AAA Authentication extension specifies\
    \ the particular\n   secret and algorithm (shared between the Mobile Node and\
    \ the\n   verification infrastructure) that must be used to perform the\n   authentication.\
    \  If the SPI value is chosen as CHAP_SPI (see section\n   9), then the mobile\
    \ node specifies CHAP-style authentication [12]\n   using MD5 [11].\n   In either\
    \ case, the MN-FA Challenge extension and one of the above\n   specified authentication\
    \ extensions MUST follow the Mobile-Home\n   Authentication extension, if present.\n\
    \   A successful Registration Reply from the Foreign Agent MAY include a\n   new\
    \ Challenge value (see section 3.3).  The Mobile Node MAY use\n   either the value\
    \ found in the latest Advertisement, or the one found\n   in the last Registration\
    \ Reply from the Foreign Agent.  This approach\n   enables the Mobile Node to\
    \ make use of the challenge without having\n   to wait for advertisements.\n \
    \  A Mobile Node might receive an UNKNOWN_CHALLENGE error (see section\n   9)\
    \ if it moves to a new Foreign Agent that cannot validate the\n   challenge provided\
    \ in the Registration Request.  In such instances,\n   the Mobile Node MUST use\
    \ a new Challenge value in any new\n   registration, obtained either from an Agent\
    \ Advertisement, or from a\n   Challenge extension to the Registration Reply containing\
    \ the error.\n   A Mobile Node that does not include a Challenge when the Mobile-\n\
    \   Foreign Authentication extension is present may receive a\n   MISSING_CHALLENGE\
    \ (see section 10) error.  In this case, the foreign\n   agent will not process\
    \ the request from the mobile node unless the\n   request contains a valid Challenge.\n\
    \   A Mobile Node that receives a BAD_AUTHENTICATION error code (see\n   section\
    \ 10) SHOULD include the MN-AAA Authentication Extension in the\n   next Registration\
    \ Request.  This will make it possible for the\n   Foreign Agent to use its AAA\
    \ infrastructure in order to authenticate\n   the Mobile Node.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2. Foreign Agent Processing for Registration Requests\n   Upon receipt of the\
    \ Registration Request, if the Foreign Agent has\n   issued a Challenge as part\
    \ of its Agent Advertisements, and it does\n   not have a security association\
    \ with the mobile node, then the\n   Foreign Agent MUST check that the MN-FA Challenge\
    \ extension exists,\n   and that it contains a challenge value previously unused\
    \ by the\n   Mobile Node.  This ensures that the mobile node is not attempting\
    \ to\n   replay a previous advertisement and authentication.  If the challenge\n\
    \   extension is needed and does not exist, the Foreign Agent MUST send a\n  \
    \ Registration Reply to the mobile node with the error code\n   MISSING_CHALLENGE.\n\
    \   A foreign agent that sends Agent Advertisements containing a\n   Challenge\
    \ value MAY send a Registration Reply message with a\n   MISSING_CHALLENGE error\
    \ if the mobile node sends a Registration\n   Request with a Mobile-Foreign Authentication\
    \ extension without\n   including a Challenge.  In other words, such a foreign\
    \ agent MAY\n   refuse to process a Registration Request request from the mobile\
    \ node\n   unless the request contains a valid Challenge.\n   If a mobile node\
    \ retransmits a Registration Request with the same\n   Identification field and\
    \ the same Challenge extension, and the\n   Foreign Agent still has a pending\
    \ Registration Request record in\n   effect for the mobile node, then the Foreign\
    \ Agent forwards the\n   Registration Request to the Home Agent again.  In all\
    \ other\n   circumstances, if the Foreign Agent receives a Registration Request\n\
    \   with a Challenge extension containing a Challenge value previously\n   used\
    \ by that mobile node, the Foreign Agent SHOULD send a\n   Registration Reply\
    \ to the mobile node containing the Code value\n   STALE_CHALLENGE.\n   The Foreign\
    \ Agent MUST NOT accept any Challenge in the Registration\n   Request unless it\
    \ was offered in last successful Registration Reply\n   issued to the Mobile Node,\
    \ or else advertised as one of the last\n   CHALLENGE_WINDOW (see section 9) Challenge\
    \ values inserted into the\n   immediately preceding Agent advertisements.  If\
    \ the Challenge is not\n   one of the recently advertised values, the foreign\
    \ Agent SHOULD send\n   a Registration Reply with Code UNKNOWN_CHALLENGE (see\
    \ section 10).\n   Furthermore, the Foreign Agent MUST check that there is either\
    \ a\n   Mobile-Foreign, or a MN-AAA Authentication extension after the\n   Challenge\
    \ extension.  Any registration message containing the\n   Challenge extension\
    \ without either of these authentication extensions\n   MUST be silently discarded.\
    \  If the registration message contains a\n   Mobile-Foreign Authentication extension\
    \ with an incorrect\n   authenticator that fails verification, the Foreign Agent\
    \ MAY send a\n   Registration Reply to the mobile node with Code value\n   BAD_AUTHENTICATION\
    \ (see Section 10).\n   If the MN-AAA Authentication extension (see Section 6)\
    \ is present in\n   the message, or if an NAI extension is included indicating\
    \ that the\n   mobile node belongs to a different administrative domain, the foreign\n\
    \   agent may take actions outside the scope of this protocol\n   specification\
    \ to carry out the authentication of the mobile node.\n   The Foreign Agent MUST\
    \ NOT remove the MN-AAA Authentication Extension\n   from the Registration Request\
    \ prior to the completion of the\n   authentication performed by the AAA infrastructure.\
    \  The appendix\n   provides an example of an action that could be taken by a\
    \ foreign\n   agent.\n   In the event that the Challenge extension is authenticated\
    \ through\n   the Mobile-Foreign Authentication Extension, the Foreign Agent MAY\n\
    \   remove the Challenge Extension from the Registration Request without\n   disturbing\
    \ the authentication value computed by the Mobile Node for\n   use by the AAA\
    \ or the Home Agent.  If the Challenge extension is not\n   removed, it MUST precede\
    \ the Foreign-Home Authentication extension.\n   If the Foreign Agent does not\
    \ remove the Challenge extension, then\n   the Foreign Agent SHOULD store the\
    \ Challenge value as part of the\n   pending registration request list [8].  Also\
    \ in this case, the\n   Foreign Agent MUST reject any Registration Reply message\
    \ coming from\n   the Home Agent that does not also include the Challenge Extension\n\
    \   with the same Challenge Value that was included in the Registration\n   Request.\
    \  The Foreign Agent MUST send the rejected Registration\n   message to the mobile\
    \ node, and change the status in the Registration\n   Reply to the value MISSING_CHALLENGE\
    \ (see section 10).\n   If the Foreign Agent does remove the Challenge extension\
    \ and\n   applicable authentication from the Registration Request message, then\n\
    \   it SHOULD insert the Identification field from the Registration\n   Request\
    \ message along with its record-keeping information about the\n   particular Mobile\
    \ Node in order to protect against replays.\n"

  - "11. IANA Considerations\n   The Generalized Mobile IP Authentication extension\
    \ defined in Section\n   5 is a Mobile IP registration extension as defined in\
    \ RFC 2002 [8]\n   and extended in RFC 2356 [7].  IANA should assign a value of\
    \ 36 for\n   this extension.\n   A new number space is to be created for enumerating\
    \ subtypes of the\n   Generalized Authentication extension (see section 5).  New\
    \ subtypes\n   of the Generalized Authentication extension, other than the number\n\
    \   (1) for the MN-AAA authentication extension specified in section 6,\n   must\
    \ be specified and approved by a designated expert.\n   The MN-FA Challenge Extension\
    \ defined in Section 4 is a router\n   advertisement extension as defined in RFC\
    \ 1256 [3] and extended in\n   RFC 2002 [8].  IANA should assign a value of 132\
    \ for this purpose.\n   The Code values defined in Section 10 are error codes\
    \ as defined in\n   RFC 2002 [8] and extended in RFC 2344 [6] and RFC 2356 [7].\
    \  They\n   correspond to error values conventionally associated with rejection\n\
    \   by the foreign agent (i.e., values from the range 64-127).  The Code\n   value\
    \ 67 is a pre-existing value which is to be used in some cases\n   with the extension\
    \ defined in this specification.  IANA should record\n   the values as defined\
    \ in Section 10.\n   A new section for enumerating algorithms identified by specific\
    \ SPIs\n   within the range 0-255 is to be added to\n      http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/mobileip-numbers.\n\
    \   The CHAP_SPI number (2) discussed in section 8 is to be assigned from\n  \
    \ this range of reserved SPI numbers.  New assignments from this\n   reserved\
    \ range must be specified and approved by the Mobile IP\n   working group.  SPI\
    \ number 1 should not be assigned unless in the\n   future the Mobile IP working\
    \ group decides that SKIP is not important\n   for enumeration in the list of\
    \ reserved numbers.  SPI number 0 should\n   not be assigned.\n"

  contents:
  - "12. Security Considerations\n   In the event that a malicious mobile node attempts\
    \ to replay the\n   authenticator for an old MN-FA Challenge, the Foreign Agent\
    \ would\n   detect it since the agent always checks whether it has recently\n\
    \   advertised the Challenge (see section 3.2).  Allowing mobile nodes\n   with\
    \ different IP addresses or NAIs to use the same Challenge value\n   does not\
    \ represent a security vulnerability, because the\n   authentication data provided\
    \ by the mobile node will be computed over\n   data that is different (at least\
    \ by the bytes of the mobile nodes' IP\n   addresses).\n   Whenever a Foreign\
    \ Agent updates a field of the Registration Reply\n   (as suggested in section\
    \ 3.2), it invalidates the authentication data\n   supplied by the Home Agent\
    \ in the MN-HA Authentication extension to\n   the Registration Reply.  Thus,\
    \ this opens up a security exposure\n   whereby a node might try to supply a bogus\
    \ Registration Reply to a\n   mobile node that causes the mobile node to act as\
    \ if its Registration\n   Reply were rejected.  This might happen when, in fact,\
    \ a Registration\n   Reply showing acceptance of the registration might soon be\
    \ received\n   by the mobile node.\n   If the foreign agent chooses a Challenge\
    \ value (see section 2) with\n   fewer than 4 bytes, the foreign agent SHOULD\
    \ maintain records that\n   also the Identification field for the mobile node.\
    \  The foreign agent\n   can then find assurance that the Registration messages\
    \ using the\n   short Challenge value are in fact unique, and thus assuredly not\n\
    \   replayed from any earlier registration.\n   Section 8 (SPI For RADIUS AAA\
    \ Servers) defines a method of computing\n   the Generalized Mobile IP Authentication\
    \ Extension's authenticator\n   field using MD5 in a manner that is consistent\
    \ with RADIUS [10].  The\n   use of MD5 in the method described in Section 8 is\
    \ less secure than\n   HMAC-MD5 [5], and should be avoided whenever possible.\n"

- title: A. Verification Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "A. Verification Infrastructure\n   The Challenge extensions in this protocol\
    \ specification are expected\n   to be useful to help the Foreign Agent manage\
    \ connectivity for\n   visiting mobile nodes, even in situations where the foreign\
    \ agent\n   does not have any security association with the mobile node or the\n\
    \   mobile node's home agent.  In order to carry out the necessary\n   authentication,\
    \ it is expected that the foreign agent will need the\n   assistance of external\
    \ administrative systems, which have come to be\n   called AAA systems.  For the\
    \ purposes of this document, we call the\n   external administrative support the\
    \ \"verification infrastructure\".\n   The verification infrastructure is described\
    \ to motivate the design\n   of the protocol elements defined in this document,\
    \ and is not\n   strictly needed for the protocol to work.  The foreign agent\
    \ is free\n   to use any means at its disposal to verify the credentials of the\n\
    \   mobile node.  This could, for instance, rely on a separate protocol\n   between\
    \ the foreign agent and the Mobile IP home agent, and still be\n   completely\
    \ invisible to the mobile node.\n   In order to verify the credentials of the\
    \ mobile node, we imagine\n   that the foreign agent has access to a verification\
    \ infrastructure\n   that can return a secure notification to the foreign agent\
    \ that the\n   authentication has been performed, along with the results of that\n\
    \   authentication.  This infrastructure may be visualized as shown in\n   figure\

    \             Figure 4: The Verification Infrastructure\n   After the foreign\
    \ agent gets the Challenge authentication, it MAY\n   pass the authentication\
    \ to the (here unspecified) infrastructure, and\n   await a Registration Reply.\
    \  If the Reply has a positive status\n   (indicating that the registration was\
    \ accepted), the foreign agent\n   accepts the registration.  If the Reply contains\
    \ the Code value\n   BAD_AUTHENTICATION (see Section 10), the foreign agent takes\
    \ actions\n   indicated for rejected registrations.\n   Implicit in this picture,\
    \ is the important observation that the\n   Foreign Agent and the Home Agent have\
    \ to be equipped to make use of\n   whatever protocol is made available to them\
    \ by the challenge\n   verification and key management infrastructure shown in\
    \ the figure.\n   The protocol messages for handling the authentication within\
    \ the\n   verification infrastructure, and identity of the agent performing the\n\
    \   verification of the Foreign Agent challenge, are not specified in\n   this\
    \ document, because those operations do not have to be performed\n   by any Mobile\
    \ IP entity.\n"
