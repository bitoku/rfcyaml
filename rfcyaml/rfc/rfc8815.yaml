  - "1.  Introduction\n   IP Multicast has been deployed in various forms, within\
    \ private\n   networks, the wider Internet, and federated networks such as national\n\
    \   or regional research networks.  While a number of service models have\n  \
    \ been published, and in many cases revised over time, there has been\n   no strong\
    \ recommendation made by the IETF on the appropriateness of\n   those models to\
    \ certain scenarios, even though vendors and\n   federations have often made such\
    \ recommendations.\n   This document addresses this gap by making a BCP-level\
    \ recommendation\n   to deprecate the use of Any-Source Multicast (ASM) for interdomain\n\
    \   multicast, leaving Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) as the recommended\n  \
    \ interdomain mode of multicast.  Therefore, this document recommends\n   that\
    \ all hosts and routers that support interdomain multicast\n   applications fully\
    \ support SSM.\n   This document does not make any statement on the use of ASM\
    \ within a\n   single domain or organization and, therefore, does not preclude\
    \ its\n   use.  Indeed, there are application contexts for which ASM is\n   currently\
    \ still widely considered well suited within a single domain.\n   The main issue\
    \ in most cases with moving to SSM is application\n   support.  Many applications\
    \ are initially deployed for intradomain\n   use and are later deployed interdomain.\
    \  Therefore, this document\n   recommends that applications support SSM, even\
    \ when they are\n   initially intended for intradomain use.  As explained below,\
    \ SSM\n   applications are readily compatible with existing intradomain ASM\n\
    \   deployments using PIM-SM, as PIM-SSM is merely a subset of PIM-SM.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Multicast Service Models\n   Any-Source Multicast (ASM) and Source-Specific\
    \ Multicast (SSM) are\n   the two multicast service models in use today.  In ASM,\
    \ as originally\n   described in [RFC1112], receivers express interest in joining\
    \ a\n   multicast group address, and routers use multicast routing protocols\n\
    \   to deliver traffic from the sender(s) to the receivers.  If there are\n  \
    \ multiple senders for a given group, traffic from all senders will be\n   delivered\
    \ to the receivers.  Since receivers specify only the group\n   address, the network\
    \ -- and therefore the multicast routing protocols\n   -- are responsible for\
    \ source discovery.\n   In SSM, by contrast, receivers specify both group and\
    \ source when\n   expressing interest in joining a multicast stream.  Source discovery\n\
    \   in SSM is handled by some out-of-band mechanism (typically in the\n   application\
    \ layer), which drastically simplifies the network and how\n   the multicast routing\
    \ protocols operate.\n   IANA has reserved specific ranges of IPv4 and IPv6 address\
    \ space for\n   multicast addressing.  Guidelines for IPv4 multicast address\n\
    \   assignments can be found in [RFC5771], while guidelines for IPv6\n   multicast\
    \ address assignments can be found in [RFC2375] and\n   [RFC3307].  The IPv6 multicast\
    \ address format is described in\n   [RFC4291].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)\n   The most commonly deployed ASM routing protocol\
    \ is Protocol\n   Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), as detailed in\n\
    \   [RFC7761].  PIM-SM, as the name suggests, was designed to be used in\n   scenarios\
    \ where the subnets with receivers are sparsely distributed\n   throughout the\
    \ network.  Because receivers do not indicate sender\n   addresses in ASM (but\
    \ only group addresses), PIM-SM uses the concept\n   of a Rendezvous Point (RP)\
    \ as a \"meeting point\" for sources and\n   receivers, and all routers in a PIM-SM\
    \ domain are configured to use a\n   specific RP(s), either explicitly or through\
    \ dynamic RP-discovery\n   protocols.\n   To enable PIM-SM to work between multiple\
    \ domains, an interdomain,\n   inter-RP signaling protocol known as Multicast\
    \ Source Discovery\n   Protocol (MSDP) [RFC3618] is used to allow an RP in one\
    \ domain to\n   learn of the existence of a source in another domain.  Deployment\n\
    \   scenarios for MSDP are given in [RFC4611].  MSDP floods information\n   about\
    \ all active sources for all multicast streams to all RPs in all\n   the domains\
    \ -- even if there is no receiver for a given application\n   in a domain.  As\
    \ a result of this key scalability and security issue,\n   along with other deployment\
    \ challenges with the protocol, MSDP was\n   never extended to support IPv6 and\
    \ remains an Experimental protocol.\n   At the time of writing, there is no IETF\
    \ interdomain solution at the\n   level of Proposed Standard for IPv4 ASM multicast,\
    \ because MSDP was\n   the de facto mechanism for the interdomain source discovery\
    \ problem,\n   and it is Experimental.  Other protocol options were investigated\
    \ at\n   the same time but were never implemented or deployed and are now\n  \
    \ historic (e.g., [RFC3913]).\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Embedded-RP\n   Due to the availability of more bits in an IPv6 address\
    \ than in IPv4,\n   an IPv6-specific mechanism was designed in support of interdomain\n\
    \   ASM, with PIM-SM leveraging those bits.  Embedded-RP [RFC3956] allows\n  \
    \ routers supporting the protocol to determine the RP for the group\n   without\
    \ any prior configuration or discovery protocols, simply by\n   observing the\
    \ unicast RP address that is embedded (included) in the\n   IPv6 multicast group\
    \ address.  Embedded-RP allows PIM-SM operation\n   across any IPv6 network in\

    \ RP.\n   IPv4 addresses in the 232/8 (232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255) range are\n\

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Observations on ASM and SSM Deployments\n   In enterprise and campus scenarios,\
    \ ASM in the form of PIM-SM is\n   likely the most commonly deployed multicast\
    \ protocol.  The\n   configuration and management of an RP (including RP redundancy)\n\
    \   within a single domain is a well-understood operational practice.\n   However,\
    \ if interworking with external PIM domains is needed in IPv4\n   multicast deployments,\
    \ interdomain MSDP is required to exchange\n   information about sources between\
    \ domain RPs.  Deployment experience\n   has shown MSDP to be a complex and fragile\
    \ protocol to manage and\n   troubleshoot.  Some of these issues include complex\
    \ Reverse Path\n   Forwarding (RPF) rules, state attack protection, and filtering\
    \ of\n   undesired sources.\n   PIM-SM is a general-purpose protocol that can\
    \ handle all use cases.\n   In particular, it was designed for cases such as videoconferencing\n\
    \   where multiple sources may come and go during a multicast session.\n   But\
    \ for cases where a single, persistent source for a group is used,\n   and receivers\
    \ can be configured to know of that source, PIM-SM has\n   unnecessary complexity.\
    \  Therefore, SSM removes the need for many of\n   the most complex components\
    \ of PIM-SM.\n   As explained above, MSDP was not extended to support IPv6.  Instead,\n\
    \   the proposed interdomain ASM solution for PIM-SM with IPv6 is\n   Embedded-RP,\
    \ which allows the RP address for a multicast group to be\n   embedded in the\
    \ group address, making RP discovery automatic for all\n   routers on the path\
    \ between a receiver and a sender.  Embedded-RP can\n   support lightweight ad\
    \ hoc deployments.  However, it relies on a\n   single RP for an entire group\
    \ that could only be made resilient\n   within one domain.  While this approach\
    \ solves the MSDP issues, it\n   does not solve the problem of unauthorized sources\
    \ sending traffic to\n   ASM multicast groups; this security issue is one of biggest\
    \ problems\n   of interdomain multicast.\n   As stated in RFC 4607, SSM is particularly\
    \ well suited to either\n   dissemination-style applications with one or more\
    \ senders whose\n   identities are known (by some out-of-band mechanism) before\
    \ the\n   application starts running or applications that utilize some\n   signaling\
    \ to indicate the source address of the multicast stream\n   (e.g., an electronic\
    \ programming guide in IPTV applications).\n   Therefore, SSM through PIM-SSM\
    \ is very well suited to applications\n   such as classic linear-broadcast TV\
    \ over IP.\n   SSM requires applications, host operating systems, and the designated\n\
    \   routers connected to receiving hosts to support Internet Group\n   Management\
    \ Protocol, Version 3 (IGMPv3) [RFC3376] and Multicast\n   Listener Discovery,\
    \ Version 2 (MLDv2) [RFC3810].  While support for\n   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 has been\
    \ commonplace in routing platforms for a long\n   time, it has also now become\
    \ widespread in common operating systems\n   for several years (Windows, Mac OS,\
    \ Linux/Android) and is no longer\n   an impediment to SSM deployment.\n"

  - "3.2.  Advantages of SSM for Interdomain Multicast\n   This section describes\
    \ the three key benefits that SSM with PIM-SSM\n   has over ASM.  These benefits\
    \ also apply to intradomain deployment\n   but are even more important in interdomain\
    \ deployments.  See\n   [RFC4607] for more details.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Reduced Network Operations Complexity
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Reduced Network Operations Complexity\n   A significant benefit of SSM\
    \ is the reduced complexity that comes\n   through eliminating the network-based\
    \ source discovery required in\n   ASM with PIM-SM.  Specifically, SSM eliminates\
    \ the need for RPs,\n   shared trees, Shortest Path Tree (SPT) switchovers, PIM\
    \ registers,\n   MSDP, dynamic RP-discovery mechanisms (Bootstrap Router (BSR)\
    \ /\n   AutoRP), and data-driven state creation.  SSM simply utilizes a small\n\
    \   subset of PIM-SM, alongside the integration with IGMPv3/MLDv2, where\n   the\
    \ source address signaled from the receiver is immediately used to\n   create\
    \ (S,G) state.  Eliminating network-based source discovery for\n   interdomain\
    \ multicast means the vast majority of the complexity of\n   multicast goes away.\n\
    \   This reduced complexity makes SSM radically simpler to manage,\n   troubleshoot,\
    \ and operate, particularly for backbone network\n   operators.  This is the main\
    \ operator motivation for the\n   recommendation to deprecate the use of ASM in\
    \ interdomain scenarios.\n   Note that this discussion does not apply to BIDIR-PIM,\
    \ and there is\n   (as mentioned above) no standardized interdomain solution for\
    \ BIDIR-\n   PIM.  In BIDIR-PIM, traffic is forwarded to the RP instead of\n \
    \  building state as in PIM-SM.  This occurs even in the absence of\n   receivers.\
    \  Therefore, BIDIR-PIM offers a trade-off of state\n   complexity at the cost\
    \ of creating unnecessary traffic (potentially a\n   large amount).\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  No Network-Wide IP Multicast Group-Address Management\n   In ASM, IP\
    \ multicast group addresses need to be assigned to\n   applications and instances\
    \ thereof, so that two simultaneously active\n   application instances will not\
    \ share the same group address and\n   receive IP multicast traffic from each\
    \ other.\n   In SSM, no such IP multicast group management is necessary.  Instead,\n\
    \   the IP multicast group address simply needs to be assigned locally on\n  \
    \ a source like a unicast transport protocol port number: the only\n   coordination\
    \ required is to ensure that different applications\n   running on the same host\
    \ don't send to the same group address.  This\n   does not require any network-operator\
    \ involvement.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Intrinsic Source-Control Security\n   SSM is implicitly secure against\

    \ messages, as\n   opposed to ASM, where any host can send traffic to a group\
    \ address\n   and have it transmitted to all receivers.  With PIM-SSM, traffic\
    \ from\n   sources not requested by any receiver will be discarded by the First-\n\
    \   Hop Router (FHR) of that source, minimizing source attacks against\n   shared\
    \ network bandwidth and receivers.\n   This benefit is particularly important\
    \ in interdomain deployments\n   because there are no standardized solutions for\
    \ ASM control of\n   sources and the most common intradomain operational practices\

- title: 4.1.  Deprecating Use of ASM for Interdomain Multicast
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Deprecating Use of ASM for Interdomain Multicast\n   This document recommends\
    \ that the use of ASM be deprecated for\n   interdomain multicast; thus, implicitly,\
    \ it recommends that hosts and\n   routers that support such interdomain applications\
    \ fully support SSM\n   and its associated protocols.  Best current practices\
    \ for deploying\n   interdomain multicast using SSM are documented in [RFC8313].\n\
    \   The recommendation applies to the use of ASM between domains where\n   either\
    \ MSDP (IPv4) or Embedded-RP (IPv6) is used.\n   An interdomain use of ASM multicast\
    \ in the context of this document\n   is one where PIM-SM with RPs/MSDP/Embedded-RP\
    \ is run on routers\n   operated by two or more separate administrative entities.\n\
    \   The focus of this document is deprecation of interdomain ASM\n   multicast,\
    \ and while encouraging the use of SSM within domains, it\n   leaves operators\
    \ free to choose to use ASM within their own domains.\n   A more inclusive interpretation\
    \ of this recommendation is that it\n   also extends to deprecating use of ASM\
    \ in the case where PIM is\n   operated in a single operator domain, but where\
    \ user hosts or non-PIM\n   network edge devices are under different operator\
    \ control.  A typical\n   example of this case is a service provider offering\

  contents:
  - "4.2.  Including Network Support for IGMPv3/MLDv2\n   This document recommends\

    \   \"IPv6 Node Requirements\" [RFC8504] states that MLDv2 must be\n   supported\
    \ in all implementations.  Such support is already widespread\n   in common host\

    \   Multicast snooping is often used to limit the flooding of multicast\n   traffic\
    \ in a Layer 2 network.  With snooping, an L2 switch will\n   monitor IGMP/MLD\
    \ messages and only forward multicast traffic out on\n   host ports that have\

  contents:
  - "4.3.  Building Application Support for SSM\n   The recommendation to use SSM\
    \ for interdomain multicast means that\n   applications should properly trigger\
    \ the sending of IGMPv3/MLDv2\n   source-specific report messages.  It should\
    \ be noted, however, that\n   there is a wide range of applications today that\
    \ only support ASM.\n   In many cases, this is due to application developers being\
    \ unaware of\n   the operational concerns of networks and the implications of\
    \ using\n   ASM versus SSM.  This document serves to provide clear direction for\n\
    \   application developers who might currently only consider using ASM to\n  \
    \ instead support SSM, which only requires relatively minor changes for\n   many\
    \ applications, particularly those with single sources.\n   It is often thought\
    \ that ASM is required for multicast applications\n   where there are multiple\
    \ sources.  However, RFC 4607 also describes\n   how SSM can be used instead of\

- title: 4.5.  Preferring SSM Applications Intradomain
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Preferring SSM Applications Intradomain\n   If feasible, it is recommended\
    \ for applications to use SSM even if\n   they are initially only meant to be\
    \ used in intradomain environments\n   supporting ASM.  Because PIM-SSM is a subset\
    \ of PIM-SM, existing\n   intradomain PIM-SM networks are automatically compatible\
    \ with SSM\n   applications.  Thus, SSM applications can operate alongside existing\n\
    \   ASM applications.  SSM's benefits of simplified address management\n   and\
    \ significantly reduced operational complexity apply equally to\n   intradomain\
    \ use.\n   However, for some applications, it may be prohibitively difficult to\n\
    \   add support for source discovery, so intradomain ASM may still be\n   appropriate.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Documenting an ASM/SSM Protocol Mapping Mechanism
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Documenting an ASM/SSM Protocol Mapping Mechanism\n   In the case of existing\
    \ ASM applications that cannot readily be\n   ported to SSM, it may be possible\
    \ to use some form of protocol\n   mapping -- i.e., to have a mechanism to translate\
    \ a (*,G) join or\n   leave to a (S,G) join or leave for a specific source S.\
    \  The general\n   challenge in performing such mapping is determining where the\n\
    \   configured source address, S, comes from.\n   There are existing vendor-specific\
    \ mechanisms deployed that achieve\n   this function, but none are documented\
    \ in IETF documents.  This may\n   be a useful area for the IETF to work on as\
    \ an interim transition\n   mechanism.  However, these mechanisms would introduce\
    \ additional\n   administrative burdens, along with the need for some form of\
    \ address\n   management, neither of which are required in SSM.  Hence, this should\n\
    \   not be considered a long-term solution.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Not Filtering ASM Addressing between Domains
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Not Filtering ASM Addressing between Domains\n   A key benefit of SSM is\
    \ that the receiver specifies the source-group\n   tuple when signaling interest\
    \ in a multicast stream.  Hence, the\n   group address need not be globally unique,\
    \ so there is no need for\n   multicast address allocation as long the reserved\
    \ SSM range is used.\n   Despite the deprecation of interdomain ASM, it is recommended\
    \ that\n   operators not filter ASM group ranges at domain boundaries, as some\n\
    \   form of ASM-SSM mappings may continue to be used for some time.\n"
- title: 4.8.  Not Precluding Intradomain ASM
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Not Precluding Intradomain ASM\n   The use of ASM within a single multicast\
    \ domain such as a campus or\n   enterprise is still relatively common today.\
    \  There are even global\n   enterprise networks that have successfully been using\
    \ PIM-SM for many\n   years.  The operators of such networks most often use Anycast-RP\n\
    \   [RFC4610] or MSDP (with IPv4) for RP resilience, at the expense of\n   the\
    \ extra operational complexity.  These existing practices are\n   unaffected by\
    \ this document.\n   In the past decade, some BIDIR-PIM deployments have scaled\n\
    \   interdomain ASM deployments beyond the capabilities of PIM-SM.  This,\n  \
    \ too, is unaffected by this document; instead, it is encouraged where\n   necessary\
    \ due to application requirements (see Section 4.4).\n   This document also does\
    \ not preclude continued use of ASM with\n   multiple PIM-SM domains inside organizations,\
    \ such as with IPv4 MSDP\n   or IPv6 Embedded-RP.  This includes organizations\
    \ that are\n   federations and have appropriate, nonstandardized mechanisms to\
    \ deal\n   with the interdomain ASM issues explained in Section 3.2.\n"
- title: 4.9.  Evolving PIM Deployments for SSM
  contents:
  - "4.9.  Evolving PIM Deployments for SSM\n   Existing PIM-SM deployments can usually\
    \ be used to run SSM\n   applications with few-to-no changes.  In some widely\
    \ available router\n   implementations of PIM-SM, PIM-SSM is simply enabled by\
    \ default in\n   the designated SSM address spaces whenever PIM-SM is enabled.\
    \  In\n   other implementations, simple configuration options exist to enable\n\
    \   it.  This allows migration of ASM applications to SSM/PIM-SSM solely\n   through\
    \ application-side development to handle source-signaling via\n   IGMPv3/MLDv2\
    \ and using SSM addresses.  No network actions are\n   required for this transition;\
    \ unchanged ASM applications can continue\n   to coexist without issues.\n   When\
    \ running PIM-SM, IGMPv3/MLDv2 (S,G) membership reports may also\n   result in\
    \ the desired PIM-SSM (S,G) operations and bypass any RP\n   procedures.  This\
    \ is not standardized but depends on implementation\n   and may require additional\
    \ configuration in available products.  In\n   general, it is recommended to always\
    \ use SSM address space for SSM\n   applications.  For example, the interaction\
    \ of IGMPv3/MLDv2 (S,G)\n   membership reports and BIDIR-PIM is undefined and\
    \ may not result in\n   forwarding of any traffic.\n   Note that these migration\
    \ recommendations do not include\n   considerations on when or how to evolve those\
    \ intradomain\n   applications best served by ASM/BIDIR-PIM from PIM-SM to BIDIR-PIM.\n\
    \   This may also be important but is outside the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 5.  Future Interdomain ASM Work
  contents:
  - "5.  Future Interdomain ASM Work\n   Future work may attempt to overcome current\
    \ limitations of ASM\n   solutions, such as interdomain deployment solutions for\
    \ BIDIR-PIM or\n   source-access-control mechanisms for IPv6 PIM-SM with embedded-RP.\n\
    \   Such work could modify or amend the recommendations of this document\n   (like\
    \ any future IETF Standards Track / BCP work).\n   Nevertheless, it is very unlikely\
    \ that any ASM solution, even with\n   such future work, can ever provide the\
    \ same intrinsic security and\n   network- and address-management simplicity as\
    \ SSM (see Section 3.2).\n   Accordingly, this document recommends that future\
    \ work for general-\n   purpose interdomain IP multicast focus on SSM items listed\
    \ in\n   Section 4.\n"

    \ attacks from unauthorized sources sending to ASM\n   multicast groups.  RFC\
