  - "1.  Introduction\n   In RFC 3095, the RObust Header Compression (ROHC) standard\
    \ framework\n   is defined, along with 4 compression profiles [RFC-3095].  Various\n\
    \   concepts are introduced within the standard that are not all very\n   extensively\
    \ defined and described, which can easily be an obstacle\n   when trying to understand\
    \ the standard.  This can especially be the\n   case when one considers how the\
    \ various parts of ROHC relate to the\n   surrounding environments where header\
    \ compression may be used.\n   The purpose of this document is to clarify these\
    \ aspects of ROHC\n   through examples and additional terminology, discussing\
    \ terms such as\n   ROHC instances, ROHC channels, ROHC feedback, and ROHC contexts.\n\
    \   This especially means to clarify how these terms relate to other\n   terms,\
    \ such as network elements and IP interfaces, which are commonly\n   used for\
    \ example when addressing MIB issues.  One explicit goal of\n   this document\
    \ is to support and simplify the ROHC MIB development\n   work.\n   The main part\
    \ of this document, sections 3 to 8, focuses on\n   clarifying the conceptual\
    \ aspects, entity relationships, and\n   terminology of ROHC [RFC-3095].  Section\
    \ 9 explains some\n   implementation implications that arise from these conceptual\
    \ aspects.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   ROHC instance\n      A logical entity that performs header\
    \ compression or decompression\n      according to one or several ROHC profiles\
    \ can be referred to as a\n      ROHC instance.  A ROHC instance is either a ROHC\
    \ compressor\n      instance or a ROHC decompressor instance.  See section 4.\n\
    \   ROHC compressor instance\n      A ROHC compressor instance is a logical entity\
    \ that performs\n      header compression according to one or several ROHC profiles.\n\
    \      There is a one-to-one relation between a ROHC compressor instance\n   \
    \   and a ROHC channel, where the ROHC compressor is located at the\n      input\
    \ end of the ROHC channel.  See section 4.1.\n   ROHC decompressor instance\n\
    \      A ROHC decompressor instance is a logical entity that performs\n      header\
    \ decompression according to one or several ROHC profiles.\n      There is a one-to-one\
    \ relation between a ROHC decompressor\n      instance and a ROHC channel, where\
    \ the ROHC decompressor is\n      located at the output end of the ROHC channel.\
    \  See section 4.2.\n   Corresponding decompressor\n      When talking about a\
    \ compressor's corresponding decompressor, this\n      refers to the peer decompressor\
    \ located at the other end of the\n      ROHC channel to which the compressor\
    \ sends compressed header\n      packets, i.e., the decompressor that decompresses\
    \ the headers\n      compressed by the compressor.\n   Corresponding compressor\n\
    \      When talking about a decompressor's corresponding compressor, this\n  \
    \    refers to the peer compressor located at the other end of the ROHC\n    \
    \  channel from which the decompressor receives compressed header\n      packets,\
    \ i.e., the compressor that compresses the headers the\n      decompressor decompresses.\n\
    \   ROHC peers\n      A ROHC compressor and its corresponding ROHC decompressor\
    \ are\n      referred to as ROHC peers.\n   Link\n      A communication path between\
    \ two network entities is, in this\n      document, generally referred to as a\
    \ link.\n   Bi-directional compression\n      If there are means to send feedback\
    \ information from a\n      decompressor to its corresponding compressor, the\
    \ compression\n      performance can be improved.  This way of operating, utilizing\
    \ the\n      feedback possibility for improved compression performance, is\n \
    \     referred to as bi-directional compression.\n   Unidirectional compression\n\
    \      If there are no means to send feedback information from a\n      decompressor\
    \ to its corresponding compressor, the compression\n      performance might not\
    \ be as good as if feedback could be utilized.\n      This way of operating, without\
    \ making use of feedback for improved\n      compression performance, is referred\
    \ to as unidirectional\n      compression.\n   ROHC channel\n      When a ROHC\
    \ compressor has transformed original packets into ROHC\n      packets with compressed\
    \ headers, these ROHC packets are sent to\n      the corresponding decompressor\
    \ through a logical point-to-point\n      connection dedicated to that traffic.\
    \  Such a logical channel,\n      which only has to carry data in this single\
    \ direction from\n      compressor to decompressor, is referred to as a ROHC channel.\
    \  See\n      section 5.\n   ROHC feedback channel\n      To allow bi-directional\
    \ compression operation, a logical point-\n      to-point connection must be provided\
    \ for feedback data from the\n      decompressor to its corresponding compressor.\
    \  Such a logical\n      channel, which only has to carry data in the single direction\
    \ from\n      decompressor to compressor, is referred to as a ROHC feedback\n\
    \      channel.  See section 6.\n   Co-located compressor/decompressor\n     \
    \ A minimal ROHC instance is only a compressor or a decompressor,\n      communicating\
    \ with a corresponding decompressor or compressor peer\n      at the other end\
    \ of a ROHC channel, thus handling packet streams\n      sent in one direction\
    \ over the link.  However, in many cases, the\n      link will carry packet streams\
    \ in both directions, and it would\n      then be desirable to also perform header\
    \ compression in both\n      directions.  That would require both a ROHC compressor\
    \ and a ROHC\n      decompressor at each end of the link, each referred to as\
    \ a co-\n      located compressor/decompressor pair.\n   Associated compressor/decompressor\n\
    \      If there is a co-located ROHC compressor/decompressor pair at each\n  \
    \    end of a link, feedback messages can be transmitted from a ROHC\n      decompressor\
    \ to its corresponding compressor by creating a virtual\n      ROHC feedback channel\
    \ among the compressed header packets sent\n      from the co-located ROHC compressor\
    \ to the decompressor co-located\n      with the compressor at the other end.\
    \  When a co-located ROHC\n      compressor/decompressor pair is connected for\
    \ this purpose, they\n      are said to be associated with each other.\n   Interspersed\
    \ feedback\n      Feedback from a ROHC decompressor to a ROHC compressor can either\n\
    \      be sent on a separate ROHC feedback channel dedicated to feedback\n   \
    \   packets, or sent among compressed header packets going in the\n      opposite\
    \ direction from a co-located (associated) compressor to a\n      similarly co-located\
    \ decompressor at the other end of the link.\n      If feedback packets are transmitted\
    \ in the latter way and sent as\n      stand-alone packets, this is referred to\
    \ as interspersed feedback.\n      See section 6.2 for an example.\n   Piggybacked\
    \ feedback\n      Feedback from a ROHC decompressor to a ROHC compressor can either\n\
    \      be sent on a separate ROHC feedback channel dedicated to feedback\n   \
    \   packets, or sent among compressed header packets going in the\n      opposite\
    \ direction from a co-located (associated) compressor to a\n      similarly co-located\
    \ decompressor at the other end of the link.\n      If feedback packets are transmitted\
    \ in the latter way and sent\n      encapsulated within compressed header packets\
    \ going in the other\n      direction, this is referred to as piggybacked feedback.\
    \  See\n      section 6.2 for an example.\n   Dedicated feedback channel\n   \
    \   A dedicated feedback channel is a logical layer two channel from a\n     \
    \ ROHC decompressor to a ROHC compressor, used only to transmit\n      feedback\
    \ packets.  See sections 6.1 and 6.3 for examples.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  ROHC External Terminology\n   When considering aspects of ROHC that relate\
    \ to the surrounding\n   networking environment where header compression may be\
    \ applied,\n   unnecessary confusion is easily created because a common, well\n\
    \   understood, and well defined, terminology is missing.  One major goal\n  \
    \ with this document is to define the preferred terminology to use when\n   discussing\
    \ header compression network integration issues.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Network Elements and IP Interfaces
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Network Elements and IP Interfaces\n   Header compression is applied over\
    \ certain links, between two\n   communicating entities in a network.  Such entities\
    \ may be referred\n   to as \"nodes\", \"network devices\", or \"network elements\"\
    , all terms\n   usually having the same meaning.  However, practice within the\
    \ area\n   of network management favors using the term \"network element\", which\n\
    \   is therefore consistently used throughout the rest of this document.\n   A\
    \ network element communicates through one or several network\n   interfaces,\
    \ which are often subject to network management, as defined\n   by MIB specifications.\
    \  In all IP internetworking, each such\n   interface has its own IP identity,\
    \ providing a common network\n   interface abstraction, independent of the link\
    \ technology hidden\n   below the interface.  Throughout the rest of this document,\
    \ such\n   interfaces will be referred to as \"IP interfaces\".\n   Thus, to visualize\
    \ the above terms, the top level hierarchy of a\n   network element is as follows,\
    \ with one or several IP interfaces:\n         +-----------------------------------------------------+\n\
    \         |                   Network Element                   |\n         +---------------+--+---------------+------------------+\n\

    \   Interface   |\n         +---------------+  +---------------+ ...\n   The next\
    \ section builds on this top level hierarchy by looking at\n   what is below an\
    \ IP interface.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Channels
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Channels\n   As mentioned in the previous section, an IP interface can\
    \ be\n   implemented on top of almost any link technology, although different\n\
    \   link technologies have different characteristics, and provide\n   communication\
    \ by different means.  However, all link technologies\n   provide the common capability\
    \ to send and/or receive data to/from the\n   IP interface.  A generic way of\
    \ visualizing the common ability to\n   communicate is to envision it as one or\
    \ several logical communication\n   channels provided by the link, where each\
    \ channel can be either bi-\n   directional or unidirectional.  Such logical point-to-point\n\
    \   connections will, throughout the rest of this document, be referred\n   to\
    \ as \"channels\", either bi-directional or unidirectional.  Note that\n   this\
    \ definition of \"channels\" is less restrictive than the definition\n   of \"\
    ROHC channels\", as given in section 5.\n   Extending the above network element\

    \   As an aside, it should be noted that a case of unidirectional\n   multipoint\
    \ links is basically the same as a number of unidirectional\n   point-to-point\
    \ links.  In such a case, each receiver only sees one\n   single sender, and the\

- title: 5.  ROHC Channels
  contents:
  - "5.  ROHC Channels\n   In section 3, a general concept of channels was introduced.\n\
    \   According to that definition, a channel is basically a logical\n   point-to-point\
    \ connection between the IP interfaces of two\n   communicating network elements.\
    \  By that definition, a channel\n   represents the kind of logical connection\
    \ needed to make header\n   compression generally applicable, and then the channel\
    \ properties\n   control whether compression can operate in a unidirectional or\
    \ bi-\n   directional manner.\n   The channel concept thus facilitates general\
    \ header compression\n   discussions, but since it groups unidirectional and bi-directional\n\
    \   connections together, it does not provide the means for describing\n   details\
    \ of how ROHC logically works.  Therefore, for the case of\n   ROHC, the channel\
    \ concept is enhanced and a more restricted concept\n   of \"ROHC channels\" is\
    \ defined.\n   A ROHC channel has the same properties as a channel, with the\n\
    \   difference that a ROHC channel is always unidirectional.  A ROHC\n   channel\
    \ therefore has one single input endpoint, connected to the CO\n   of one single\
    \ ROHC compressor instance, and one single output\n   endpoint, connected to the\
    \ CI of one single ROHC decompressor\n   instance.  A ROHC channel must thus in\
    \ this way be logically\n   dedicated to one ROHC compressor and one ROHC decompressor,\
    \ hereafter\n   referred to as ROHC peers, creating a one-to-one mapping between\
    \ a\n   ROHC channel and two ROHC compressor/decompressor peers.\n   +--------------+\

    \ allocate\n   one ROHC channel in each direction, allowing ROHC compression to\
    \ be\n   performed in both directions.  The reason for defining ROHC channels\n\

- title: 7.  ROHC Contexts
  contents:
  - "7.  ROHC Contexts\n   In previous sections, it has been clarified that one network\
    \ element\n   may have multiple IP interfaces, one IP interface may have multiple\n\
    \   ROHC instances running (not necessarily both compressors and\n   decompressors),\
    \ and for each ROHC instance, there is exactly one ROHC\n   channel and optionally\
    \ one ROHC feedback channel.  How ROHC channels\n   and ROHC feedback channels\
    \ are realized will differ from case to\n   case, depending on the actual layer\
    \ two technology used.\n   Each compressor/decompressor can further compress/decompress\
    \ an\n   arbitrary (but limited) number of concurrent packet streams sent over\n\
    \   the ROHC channel connected to that compressor/decompressor.  Each\n   packet\
    \ stream relates to one particular context in the\n   compressor/decompressor.\
    \  When sent over the ROHC channel, compressed\n   packets are labeled with a\
    \ context identifier (CID), indicating to\n   which context the compressed packet\
    \ corresponds.  There is thus a\n   one-to-one mapping between the number of contexts\
    \ that can be present\n   in a compressor/decompressor and the context identifier\

- title: 8.  Summary
  contents:
  - "8.  Summary\n   This document has introduced and defined a number of concepts\
    \ and\n   terms for use in ROHC network integration, and explained how the\n \
    \  various pieces relate to each other.  In the following bullet list,\n   the\
    \ most important relationship conclusions are repeated:\n   -  A network element\
    \ may have one or several IP interfaces.\n   -  Each IP interface is connected\
    \ to one or several logical layer two\n      channels.\n   -  Each IP interface\
    \ may have one or several ROHC instances, either\n      compressors, decompressors,\
    \ or an arbitrary mix of both.\n   -  For each ROHC instance, there is exactly\
    \ one ROHC channel, and\n      optionally exactly one ROHC feedback channel.\n\
    \   -  How ROHC channels and ROHC feedback channels are realized through\n   \
    \   the available logical layer two channels will vary, and there is\n      therefore\
    \ no general relation between ROHC instances and logical\n      layer two channels.\
    \  ROHC instances map only to ROHC channels and\n      ROHC feedback channels.\n\
    \   -  Each compressor owns its own context identifier (CID) space, which\n  \
    \    is the multiplexing mechanism it uses when sending compressed\n      header\
    \ packets to its corresponding decompressor.  That CID space\n      thus defines\
    \ how many compressed packet streams can be\n      concurrently sent over the\
    \ ROHC channel allocated to the\n      compressor/decompressor peers.\n"
- title: 9.  Implementation Implications
  contents:
  - "9.  Implementation Implications\n   This section will address how the conceptual\
    \ aspects discussed above\n   affect implementations of ROHC.\n   ROHC is defined\
    \ as a general header compression framework on top of\n   which compression profiles\
    \ can be defined for each specific set of\n   headers to compress.  Although the\
    \ framework holds a number of\n   important mechanisms, the separation between\
    \ framework and profiles\n   is mainly a separation from a standardization point\
    \ of view, to\n   indicate what must be common to all profiles, what must be defined\
    \ by\n   all profiles, and what are profile-specific details.  To implement\n\
    \   the framework as a separate module is thus not an obvious choice,\n   especially\
    \ if one wants to use profile implementations from different\n   vendors.  However,\
    \ optimized implementations will probably separate\n   the common parts and implement\
    \ those in a ROHC framework module, and\n   add profile modules to that.\n   A\
    \ ROHC instance might thus consist of various pieces of\n   implementation modules,\
    \ profiles, and potentially also a common ROHC\n   module, possibly from different\
    \ vendors.  If vendor and\n   implementation version information is made available\
    \ for network\n   management purposes, this should thus be done on a per-profile\
    \ basis,\n   and potentially also for the instance as a whole.\n"

    \ their relations to IP\n   interfaces and the physical medium, plays a critical\
    \ role in ensuring\n   secure usage of ROHC.  This document is therefore a valuable\
    \ adjunct\n   to the Security Considerations found in RFC 3095 and other ROHC\n\
    \   specifications.  However, as it just reviews information and\n   definitions,\
    \ it does not add new security issues to the ROHC protocol\n   specifications.\n"
