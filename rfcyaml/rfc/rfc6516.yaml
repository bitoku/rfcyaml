    to be used to bind\n   particular customer multicast flows to particular tunnels
    through a\n   service provider's network.  This document extends the MVPN\n   specification
    (RFC 6513) so that these options can be used when the\n   customer multicast flows
    are IPv6 flows.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN) specification
    [RFC6513]\n   defines the notion of a \"PMSI\" (Provider Multicast Service Interface)\n
    \  and specifies how a PMSI can be instantiated by various kinds of\n   tunnels
    through a service provider's network (\"P-tunnels\").  It also\n   specifies the
    procedures for using PIM (Protocol Independent\n   Multicast [RFC4601]) as the
    control protocol between Provider Edge\n   (PE) routers.  When PIM is used as
    the control protocol, PIM messages\n   are sent through a P-tunnel from one PE
    in an MVPN to others in the\n   same MVPN.  These PIM messages carry customer
    multicast routing\n   information.  However, [RFC6513] does not cover the case
    where the\n   customer is using IPv6, but the service provider is using P-tunnels\n
    \  created by PIM over an IPv4 infrastructure.\n   The MVPN specification [RFC6513]
    also specifies \"S-PMSI (Selective\n   PMSI) Join\" messages, which are optionally
    used to bind particular\n   customer multicast flows to particular P-tunnels.
    \ However, the\n   specification does not cover the case where the customer flows
    are\n   IPv6 flows.\n   This document extends [RFC6513] by adding the specification
    for\n   handling customer IPv6 multicast flows when a service provider is\n   using
    PE-PE PIM and/or S-PMSI Join messages over an IPv4\n   infrastructure.  This document
    also specifies how to send multiple\n   S-PMSI Join messages in a single UDP datagram.\n
    \  This document uses terminology defined in [RFC6513]: C-source,\n   C-group,
    C-flow, P-group, and (C-S,C-G).\n"

  - "3.  S-PMSI Joins Binding IPv6 Flows to GRE/IPv4 P-Tunnels\n   The S-PMSI Join
    message is defined in Section 7.4.2.2 of [RFC6513].\n   These messages contain
    a type field, and [RFC6513] defines only Type\n   1 S-PMSI Joins.  A Type 1 S-PMSI
    Join may be used to assign a\n   customer IPv4 (C-S,C-G) flow to a P-tunnel that
    is created by\n   PIM/IPv4.  To transmit data or control packets over such a P-tunnel,\n
    \  the packets are encapsulated in GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)\n   within
    IPv4, as specified in Section 12 of [RFC6513].\n   In this document, we define
    the Type 4 S-PMSI Join.  A Type 4 S-PMSI\n   Join may be used to assign a customer
    IPv6 (C-S,C-G) flow to a\n   P-tunnel that is created by PIM/IPv4.  GRE/IPv4 encapsulation
    is used\n   to send data or control packets on the P-tunnel.\n"

    - "3.2.  Encapsulation of S-PMSI Joins in UDP Datagrams\n   All S-PMSI Joins are
      encapsulated in UDP datagrams [RFC768].  A Type\n   4 S-PMSI Join MUST be encapsulated
      in an IPv6 UDP datagram.  The IPv6\n   source address field of these datagrams
      SHOULD be the IPv4-mapped\n   IPv6 address [RFC4291] corresponding to the IPv4
      address that the\n   originating PE router uses as its source address in the
      instance of\n   PIM that is used to create the specified P-tunnel.\n   A single
      UDP datagram MAY carry multiple S-PMSI Join messages, as\n   many as can fit
      entirely within it.  If there are multiple S-PMSI\n   Joins in a UDP datagram,
      they MUST be of the same S-PMSI Join type.\n   The end of the last S-PMSI Join
      (as determined by the S-PMSI Join\n   length field) MUST coincide with the end
      of the UDP datagram, as\n   determined by the UDP length field.  When processing
      a received UDP\n   datagram that contains one or more S-PMSI Joins, a router
      MUST\n   process all the S-PMSI Joins that fit into the datagram.\n"

  - "4.  PE-PE PIM/IPv6 over an IPv4 P-Tunnel\n   If a VPN customer is using PIM over
    IPv6, but the SP (service\n   provider) is using an IPv4 infrastructure (i.e.,
    is using an\n   IPv4-based control protocol to construct its P-tunnels), then
    the PE\n   routers will need to originate IPv6 PIM control messages.  The IPv6\n
    \  Source Address field of any such IPv6 PIM control message SHOULD be\n   the
    IPv4-mapped IPv6 address [RFC4291] corresponding to the IPv4\n   address that
    the originating PE router uses as its source address in\n   the instance of PIM
    that is used to create the specified P-tunnel.\n   If the IPv6 Destination Address
    field is the multicast address ALL-\n   PIM-ROUTERS, the IPv6 form of the address
    (ff02::d) is used.  These\n   IPv6 PIM control messages are, of course, not transmitted
    natively\n   over the service provider's network but rather are encapsulated in\n
