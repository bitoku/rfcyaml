Abstract This document revises all Enumservices that were IANA registered under the now obsolete specification of the Enumservice registry defined in RFC 3761.
Introduction [RFC6117] has obsoleted the IANA registration section of [RFC3761].
Since the IANA Enumservice registry contains various Enumservices registered under the regime of RFC 3761, those registrations do not conform to the new guidelines as specified in [RFC6117].
To ensure consistency among all Enumservice registrations at IANA, this document adds the (nowadays) missing elements to those legacy registrations.
Furthermore, all legacy Enumservice registrations are converted to the new XML chunk format, and, where deemed necessary, minor editorial corrections are applied.
However, this document only adds the missing elements to the XML chunks as specified in the IANA Considerations section of [RFC6117], but it does not complete the (nowadays) missing sections of the corresponding Enumservice Specifications.
In order to conform with the new registration regime as specified in [RFC6117], those Enumservice Specifications still have to be revised.
It is important to note that this document does not update the functional specification of the concerned Enumservices.
The following RFCs are updated by this document:  [RFC3762]  [RFC3764]  [RFC3953]  [RFC4143]  [RFC4002]  [RFC4238]  [RFC4355]  [RFC4415]  [RFC4769]  [RFC4969]  [RFC4979]  [RFC5028]
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
According to [RFC3761], any Enumservice registration had to be published as a Standards Track, Experimental, or BCP (Best Current Practice) RFC.
[RFC6117] no longer has this requirement, i.e., "Specification Required", which implies the use of a Designated Expert [RFC5226], is sufficient.
This document changes the approval requirement for updates to Enumservice registrations to Specification Required, whereby the specification and request are reviewed by a Designated Expert as described in [RFC6117].
Legacy Enumservice Registrations Converted to XML Chunks
In the following, the legacy Enumservice Registrations are converted to XML chunks that include the new elements introduced by [RFC6117].
(Note that references in Sections 4.1 4.39 refer to the references section within the respective Enumservice Specification.)

The URI Scheme is 'mailto' because facsimile is a profile of standard Internet mail and uses standard Internet mail addressing.
This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is an 'im:' URI.
The 'im:' URI scheme does not identify any particular protocol that will be used to handle instant messaging receipt or delivery, rather the mechanism in RFC 3861 [4]
is used to discover whether an IM protocol supported by the party querying ENUM is also supported by the target resource.
This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the associated URI is capable of receiving a message using an email protocol.

Within and between MMS Environments (MMSE, network infrastructures that support the MultiMedia Service), other pieces of state data (for example, charging significant information) are exchanged between MMS Relay Servers.
Thus, although these servers use SMTP as the "bearer" for their application exchanges, they map their internal state to specialized header fields carried in the SMTP message exchanges.
The header fields used in such MMSE are described in detail in [17].

The MMS Architecture describes an interface between the MMSE and "legacy messaging systems" (labelled as MM3) that accepts "standard" SMTP messages.
Thus, although the MMS Relay Server that supports this interface appears as a standard SMTP server from the perspective of an Internet based mail server, it acts as a gateway and translator, adding the internal state data that is used within and between the MMS Environments.
This mechanism is described in [17], which also includes references to the specifications agreed by those bodies responsible for the design of the MMS.
> References are contained in <xref type "rfc" data "rfc4355"/

If an entry includes this Enumservice, then in effect this can be taken as implying that the recipient is capable of receiving EMS or SMS messages at this address.
Such choices on the end system design do have two small caveats; whilst in practice all terminals supporting MMS today support SMS as well
, it might not necessarily be the case in the future, and there may be tariff differences in using the MMS rather than using the SMS or EMS.

This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the associated URI scheme is capable of being a source of information.
> Note that the kind of information retrieved can be manifold.
Usually, contacting a resource by an 'http:'
[11] URI provides a document.
This document can contain references that will trigger the download of many different kinds of information, such as text, audio, video, executable code, or even video message files.
Thus, one cannot be more specific about the kind of information expected when contacting the resource.

This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the associated URI scheme is capable of being a source of information, which can be contacted using TLS or the Secure Socket Layer protocol.
> Note that the kind of information retrieved can be manifold.
Usually, contacting a resource by an 'https:' [12] URI provides a document.

The kind of communication indicated by this Enumservice is "Interactive Voice".
From a protocol perspective, this communication is expected to involve bidirectional media streams carrying audio data.
A client may imply that the person controlling population of a NAPTR holding this Enumservice indicates their capability to engage in an interactive voice session when contacted using the URI generated by this NAPTR.
<xref type "rfc" data "rfc4415"/
> <xref type "person" data "Rudolf Brandner"/
This Enumservice indicates that the person responsible for the NAPTR is accessible via the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) or PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) using the value of the generated URI.
The kind of subsystem required to initiate a Voice Enumservice with this Subtype is a "Dialler".
This is a subsystem that either provides a local connection to the PSTN or PLMN, or that provides an indirect connection to those networks.
The subsystem will use the telephone number held in the generated URI to place a voice call.
The voice call is placed to a network that uses E.164 numbers to route calls to an appropriate destination.
> Note that the PSTN/PLMN connection may be indirect.
The end user receiving this NAPTR may have a relationship with a Communications Service Provider that accepts call initiation requests from that subsystem using an IP based protocol such as SIP or H.323, and places the call to the PSTN using a remote gateway service.
In this case, the Provider may either accept requests using "tel:" URIs or has a defined mechanism to convert "tel:" URI values into a "protocol native" form.
> The "tel:" URI value SHOULD be fully qualified (using the "global phone number" form of RFC 3966 [10]).
A "local phone number" as defined in that document SHOULD NOT be used unless the controller of the zone in which the NAPTR appears is sure that it can be distinguished unambiguously by all clients that can access the resource record and that a call from their network access points can be routed to that destination.

One of the fundamental dangers related to any service such as this is that a malicious entry in a resolver's database will cause clients to resolve the E.164 into the wrong LDAP URI.
The possible intent may be to cause the client to connect to a rogue LDAP server and retrieve (or fail to retrieve) a resource containing fraudulent or damaging information.
By removing the URI to which the E.164 maps, a malicious intruder may remove the client's ability to access the LDAP directory server.

E.164 number not in the numbering plan E.164 number in the numbering plan, but no URLs exist for that number E2U VPIM:
Mailto Service unavailable Security Considerations: Malicious Redirection One of the fundamental dangers related to any service such as this is that a malicious entry in a resolver's database will cause clients to resolve the E.164 into the wrong email URL.
The possible intent may be to cause the client to send the information to an incorrect destination.
Denial of Service By removing the URL to which the E.164 maps, a malicious intruder may remove the client's ability to access the resource.
The exposure of email addresses through the ENUM service provides a bulk mailer access to large numbers of email addresses where only the telephone number was previously known.
Service Name: E.164 to VPIM LDAP URL URI Type:
See section 3.2 through 3.3 of [RFC4238] Intended Usage:
Malicious Redirection One of the fundamental dangers related to any service such as this is that a malicious entry in a resolver's database will cause clients to resolve the E.164 into the wrong LDAP URL.
The possible intent may be to cause the client to connect to a rogue LDAP server and retrieve (or fail to retrieve) a resource containing fraudulent or damaging information.
Denial of Service By removing the URL to which the E.164 maps, a malicious intruder may remove the client's ability to access the LDAP directory server.
Enumservice Name: "voice" Enumservice Type: "voice" Enumservice Subtype:
The kind of communication indicated by this Enumservice is "Interactive Voice".
From a protocol perspective, this communication is expected to involve bidirectional media streams carrying audio data.
A client may imply that the person controlling population of a NAPTR holding this Enumservice indicates their capability to engage in an interactive voice session when contacted using the URI generated by this NAPTR.

COMMON Authors:  Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny (for author contact detail see Authors' Addresses section)
Any other information the author deems interesting: This Enumservice indicates that the person responsible for the NAPTR is accessible via the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) or PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) using the value of the generated URI.
The kind of subsystem required to initiate a Voice Enumservice with this sub type is a "Dialler".
This is a subsystem that either provides a local connection to the PSTN or PLMN, or that provides an indirect connection to those networks.
The subsystem will use the telephone number held in the generated URI to place a voice call.
The voice call is placed to a network that uses E.164 numbers to route calls to an appropriate destination.
Note that the PSTN/PLMN connection may be indirect.
The end user receiving this NAPTR may have a relationship with a Communications Service Provider that accepts call initiation requests from that subsystem using an IP based protocol such as SIP or H.323, and places the call to the PSTN using a remote gateway service.
In this case the Provider may either accept requests using "tel:" URIs or has a defined mechanism to convert "tel:" URI values into a "protocol native" form.
The "tel:" URI value SHOULD be fully qualified (using the "global phone number" form of RFC3966 [10]).
A "local phone number" as defined in that document SHOULD NOT be used unless the controller of the zone in which the NAPTR appears is sure that it can be distinguished unambiguously by all clients that can access the resource record and that a call from their network access points can be routed to that destination.
Enumservice Name: "pstn" Enumservice Type:
"pstn" Enumservice Subtype: "tel" URI Scheme: 'tel:'
These Enumservices indicate that the remote resource identified can be addressed by the associated URI scheme in order to initiate a telecommunication session, which may include two way voice or other communications, to the PSTN.
These URIs may contain number portability data as specified in RFC 4694 [10].
: See Section 7 of [RFC4769].
Any other information the author deems interesting: A Number Portability Dip Indicator (npdi) should be used in practice (see examples below in Section 4 of [RFC4769]).
Enumservice Name: "pstn" Enumservice Type: "pstn" Enumservice Subtype: "sip" URI Scheme: 'sip:'

Enumservice Name: "vCard" Enumservice Name: "vCard" Enumservice Type: "vcard" Enumservice Subtype: n/
a URI Schemes: "http", "https
This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is a plain vCard, according to RFC 2426, which may be accessed using HTTP/ HTTPS [7].
Clients fetching the vCard from the resource indicated should expect access to be restricted.
Additionally, the comprehension of the data provided may vary depending on the client's identity.
Security Considerations: see Section 5 [RFC4969]

This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is an XMPP entity.
Security Considerations: see Section 6 of [RFC4979]
Alexander Mayrhofer <alexander.mayrhofer&enum.at> Enumservice Name: "
This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is an 'im:' URI.
The 'im:' URI scheme does not identify any particular protocol that will be used to handle instant messaging receipt or delivery, rather the mechanism in RFC 3861 [4]
is used to discover whether an IM protocol supported by the party querying ENUM is also supported by the target resource.
