- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The 6Bone is an environment supporting experimentation with\
    \ the IPv6\n   protocols and products implementing it. As the network grows, the\n\
    \   need for common operation rules emerged. In particular, operation of\n   the\
    \ 6Bone backbone is a challenge due to the frequent insertion of\n   bogus routes\
    \ by leaf or even backbone sites.\n   This memo identifies guidelines on how 6Bone\
    \ sites might operate, so\n   that the 6Bone can remain a quality experimentation\
    \ environment and\n   to avoid pathological situations that have been encountered\
    \ in the\n   past. It defines the 'best current practice' acceptable in the 6Bone\n\
    \   for the configuration of both Interior Gateway Protocols (such as\n   RIPng\
    \ [RFC 2080]) and Exterior Gateway Protocols (like BGP4+ [RFC\n   2283]).\n  \
    \ The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\"\
    ,\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Basic principles
  contents:
  - "2.  Basic principles\n   The 6Bone is structured as a hierarchical network with\
    \ pseudo Top\n   Level Aggregator (pTLA) sites, pseudo Next Level Aggregator (pNLA)\n\
    \   sites and leaf sites. This topology supports the IPv6 address\n   aggregation\
    \ architecture as described in [1]. The 6Bone backbone is\n   made of a mesh interconnecting\
    \ pTLAs only. pNLAs connect to one or\n   more pTLAs and provide transit service\
    \ for leaf sites.\n   pTLA sites MUST use BGP4+ [RFC 2283] as the mandatory routing\n\
    \   protocol for exchanging routing information among them.\n   Multi-homed sites\
    \ or pNLAs SHOULD also use BGP4+. Regular sites MAY\n   use a simple default route\
    \ to their ISP.\n"
- title: 3.  Common Rules
  contents:
  - "3.  Common Rules\n   This section details common rules governing the routing\
    \ on the 6Bone.\n   They are derived from issues encountered on the 6Bone, with\
    \ respect\n   to the routes advertised, handling of special addresses, and\n \
    \  aggregation:\n    1) link local prefixes\n    2) site local prefixes\n    3)\
    \ loopback prefix & unspecified prefix\n    4) multicast prefixes\n    5) IPv4-compatible\
    \ prefixes\n    6) IPv4-mapped prefixes\n    7) default routes\n    8) Yet undefined\
    \ unicast prefixes (from a different /3 prefix)\n    9) Inter site links issues\n\
    \    10) aggregation & advertisement issues\n"
- title: 3.1  Link-local prefix
  contents:
  - "3.1  Link-local prefix\n   The link-local prefix (FE80::/10) MUST NOT be advertised\
    \ through\n   either an IGP or an EGP.\n   By definition, the link-local prefix\
    \ has a scope limited to a\n   specific link. Since the prefix is the same on\
    \ all IPv6 links,\n   advertising it in any routing protocol does not make sense\
    \ and,\n   worse, may introduce nasty error conditions.\n   Well known cases where\
    \ link local prefixes could be advertised by\n   mistake include:\n   - a router\
    \ advertising all directly connected network prefixes\n     including the link-local\
    \ one.\n   - Subnetting of the link-local prefix.\n   In such cases, vendors should\
    \ be urged to correct their code.\n"
- title: 3.2  Site-local prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.2  Site-local prefixes\n   Site local prefixes (in the FEC0::/10 range) MAY\
    \ be advertized by\n   IGPs or EGPs within a site. The precise definition of a\
    \ site is\n   ongoing work discussed in the IPng working group.\n   Site local\
    \ prefixes MUST NOT be advertised to transit pNLAs or pTLAs.\n"
- title: 3.3  Loopback and unspecified prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.3  Loopback and unspecified prefixes\n   The loopback prefix (::1/128) and\
    \ the unspecified prefix (::0/128)\n   MUST NOT be advertised by any routing protocol.\n"
- title: 3.4  Multicast prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.4  Multicast prefixes\n   Multicast prefixes MUST NOT be advertised by any\
    \ unicast routing\n   protocol.  Multicast routing protocols are designed to respect\
    \ the\n   semantics of multicast and MUST therefore be used to route packets\n\
    \   with multicast destination addresses (in the range FF00::/8).\n   Multicast\
    \ address scopes MUST be respected on the 6Bone. Only global\n   scope multicast\
    \ addresses MAY be routed across transit pNLAs and\n   pTLAs. There is no requirement\
    \ on a pTLA to route multicast packets.\n   Organization-local multicasts (in\
    \ the FF08::/16 or FF18::/16 ranges)\n   MAY be routed across a pNLA to its leaf\
    \ sites.\n   Site-local multicasts MUST NOT be routed toward transit pNLAs or\n\
    \   pTLAs.\n   Obviously, link-local multicasts and node-local multicasts MUST\
    \ NOT\n   be routed at all.\n"
- title: 3.5  IPv4-compatible prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.5  IPv4-compatible prefixes\n   Sites may choose to use IPv4 compatible addresses\
    \ (::a.b.c.d)\n   internally.  As there is no real rationale today for doing that,\n\
    \   these addresses SHOULD\n   NOT be used in the 6Bone.\n   The ::/96 IPv4-compatible\
    \ prefixes MAY be advertised by IGPs.\n   IPv4-compatible prefixes MUST NOT be\
    \ advertised by EGPs to transit\n   pNLAs or pTLAs.\n"
- title: 3.6  IPv4-mapped prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.6  IPv4-mapped prefixes\n   IPv4-mapped prefixes (::FFFF:a.b.c.d where a.b.c.d\
    \ is an IPv4\n   address) MAY be advertised by IGPs within a site. It may be useful\n\
    \   for some IPv6 only nodes within a site to have such a route pointing\n   to\
    \ a translation device.\n   IPv4-mapped prefixes MUST NOT be advertised by EGPs.\n"
- title: 3.7  Default routes
  contents:
  - "3.7  Default routes\n   6Bone core pTLA routers MUST be default-free.\n   pTLAs\
    \ MAY advertise a default route to their pNLAs. Transit pNLAs MAY\n   do the same\
    \ for their leaf sites.\n"
- title: 3.8  Yet undefined unicast prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.8  Yet undefined unicast prefixes\n   Yet undefined unicast prefixes from a\
    \ format prefix other than\n   2000::/3 MUST NOT be advertised by any routing\
    \ protocol in the 6Bone.\n   In particular, RFC 2471 test addresses MUST NOT be\
    \ advertised on the\n   6Bone.\n   Routing of global unicast prefixes outside\
    \ of the 6Bone range\n   (3FFE::/16) is discussed in section 4, Routing policies,\
    \ below.\n"
- title: 3.9  Inter-site links
  contents:
  - "3.9  Inter-site links\n   Global IPv6 addresses MUST be used for the end points\
    \ of the inter-\n   site links. In particular, IPv4 compatible addresses MUST\
    \ NOT be used\n   for tunnels.\n   Prefixes for those links MUST NOT be injected\
    \ in the global routing\n   tables.\n"
- title: 3.10  Aggregation & advertisement issues
  contents:
  - "3.10  Aggregation & advertisement issues\n   Route aggregation MUST be performed\
    \ by any border router.\n   Sites or pNLAs MUST only advertise to their upstream\
    \ provider the\n   prefixes assigned by that ISP unless otherwise agreed.\n  \
    \ Site border router MUST NOT advertise prefixes more specific than the\n   /48\
    \ ones allocated by their ISP.\n   pTLA MUST NOT advertise prefixes longer than\
    \ 24 to other pTLAs unless\n   special peering agreements are implemented. When\
    \ such special peering\n   agreements are in place between any two or more pTLAs,\
    \ care MUST be\n   taken not to leak the more specific prefixes to other pTLAs\
    \ not\n   participating in the peering agreement.\n"
- title: 4.  Routing policies
  contents:
  - "4.  Routing policies\n   6Bone backbone sites maintain the mesh into the backbone\
    \ and provide\n   an as reliable as possible service, granted the 6Bone is an\n\
    \   experimentation tool.  To achieve their mission, 6Bone backbone sites\n  \
    \ MUST maintain peerings with at least 3 (three) other back bone sites.\n   The\
    \ peering agreements across the 6Bone are by nature non-commercial,\n   and therefore\
    \ SHOULD allow transit traffic through.\n   Eventually, the Internet registries\
    \ will assign other TLAs than the\n   6Bone one (currently 3FFE::/16). The organizations\
    \ bearing those TLAs\n   will establish a new IPv6 network, parallel to the 6Bone.\
    \ The 6Bone\n   MIGHT interconnect with this new IPv6 Internet, b ut transit across\n\
    \   the 6Bone will not be guaranteed. It will be left to each 6Bone\n   backbone\
    \ site to decide whether it will carry traffic to or from the\n   IPv6 Internet.\n"
- title: 5.  The 6Bone registry
  contents:
  - "5.  The 6Bone registry\n   The 6Bone registry is a RIPE-181 database with IPv6\
    \ extensions used\n   to store information about the 6Bone. Each 6Bone site MUST\
    \ maintain\n   the relevant entries in the 6Bone registry (whois.6bone.net). In\n\
    \   particular, the following objects MUST be present:\n   - IPv6-site: site description\n\
    \   - Inet6num: prefix delegation\n   - Mntner: coordinate of site maintenance\
    \ staff\n   Other objects MAY be maintained at the discretion of the sites, such\n\
    \   as routing policy descriptors, person or role objects. The Mntner\n   object\
    \ MUST make reference to a role or person object, but those must\n   not necessarily\
    \ reside in the 6Bone registry, they can be stored\n   within any of the Internet\
    \ registry databases (RIPE, InterNIC, APNIC,\n"
- title: 6.  Guidelines for new sites joining the 6Bone
  contents:
  - "6.  Guidelines for new sites joining the 6Bone\n   New sites joining the 6Bone\
    \ should seek to connect to a transit pNLA\n   or a pTLA within their region,\
    \ and preferably as close as possible to\n   their existing IPv4 physical and\
    \ routing path for Internet service.\n   The 6Bone registry is available to find\
    \ out candidate ISPs.\n   Any site connected to the 6Bone MUST maintain a DNS\
    \ server for\n   forward name looking and reverse address translation. The joining\n\
    \   site MUST maintain the 6Bone registry objects relative to its site,\n   and\
    \ in particular the IPv6- site and the MNTNER objects.\n   The upstream ISP MUST\
    \ delegate the reverse address translation zone\n   in DNS to the joining site.\
    \ The ISP MUST also create 6Bone registry\n   objects reflecting the delegated\
    \ address space (inet6num:).\n   Up to date information about how to join the\
    \ 6Bone is available on\n   the 6Bone Web site at http://www.6bone.net.\n"
- title: 7.  Guidelines for 6Bone pTLA sites
  contents:
  - "7.  Guidelines for 6Bone pTLA sites\n   6Bone pTLA sites are altogether forming\
    \ the backbone of the 6Bone. In\n   order to ensure the highest level possible\
    \ of availability and\n   stability for the 6Bone environment, a few constraints\
    \ are placed\n   onto sites wishing to become or stay a 6Bone pTLA:\n   1. The\
    \ site MUST have experience with IPv6 on the 6Bone, at least as\n      a leaf\
    \ site and preferably as a transit pNLA under an existing\n      pTLA.\n   2.\
    \ The site MUST have the ability and intent to provide \"production-\n      like\"\
    \ 6Bone backbone service to provide a robust and operationally\n      reliable\
    \ 6Bone backbone.\n   3. The site MUST have a potential \"user community\" that\
    \ would be\n      served by becoming a pTLA, e.g., the requester is a major player\n\
    \      in a region, country or focus of interest.\n   4. Must commit to abide\
    \ by the 6Bone backbone operational rules and\n      policies as defined in the\
    \ present document.\n   When a candidate site seeks to become a pTLA site, it\
    \ will apply for\n   it to the 6Bone Operations group (see below) by bringing\
    \ evidences it\n   meets the above criteria.\n"
- title: 8.  6Bone Operations group
  contents:
  - "8.  6Bone Operations group\n   The 6Bone Operations group is the body in charge\
    \ of monitoring the\n   adherence to the present rules, and will take the appropriate\
    \ actions\n   to correct deviations. Membership in the 6Bone Operations group\
    \ is\n   mandatory for, and restricted to, any site connected to the 6Bone.\n\
    \   The 6Bone Operations group is currently defined by those members of\n   the\
    \ existing 6Bone mailing list, i.e., 6bone@isi.edu, who represent\n   sites participating\
    \ on the 6Bone. Therefore it is incumbent on\n   relevant site contacts to join\
    \ the mailing list. Instructions on how\n   to join the list are maintained on\
    \ the 6Bone web site at\n   http://www.6bone.net.\n"
- title: 9.  Common rules enforcement
  contents:
  - "9.  Common rules enforcement\n   Participation in the 6Bone is a voluntary and\
    \ benevolent undertaking.\n   However, participating sites are expected to adhere\
    \ to the rules\n   described in this document, in order to maintain the 6Bone\
    \ as quality\n   tool for experimenting with the IPv6 protocols and products\n\
    \   implementing them.\n   The following processes are proposed to help enforcing\
    \ the 6Bone\n   rules:\n   - Each pTLA site has committed when requesting their\
    \ pTLA to\n     implement the rules, and to ensure they are respected by sites\n\
    \     within their administrative control (i.e. those to who prefixes\n     have\
    \ been delegated).\n   - When a site detects an issue, it will first use the 6Bone\
    \ registry\n     to contact the site maintainer and work the issue.\n   - If nothing\
    \ happens, or there is disagreement on what the right\n     solution is, the issue\
    \ can be brought to the 6Bone Operations\n     group.\n   - When the problem is\
    \ related to a product issue, the site(s)\n     involved is responsible for contact\
    \ the product vendor and work\n     toward its resolution.\n   - When an issue\
    \ causes major operational problems, backbone sites may\n     decide to temporarily\
    \ set filters in order to restore service.\n"
- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n     The result of bogus entries in routing tables\
    \ is usually\n     unreachable sites.  Having guidelines to aggregate or reject\
    \ routes\n     will clean up the routing tables. It is expected that using these\n\
    \     guidelines, routing on the 6Bone will be less sensitive to denial\n    \
    \ of service attacks due to misleading routes.\n     The 6Bone is a test network.\
    \ Therefore, denial of service, packet\n     disclosure, are to be expected.\n"
