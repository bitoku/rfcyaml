- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   It is common practice on the Internet to permit anonymous access\
    \ to\n   various services.  Traditionally, this has been done with a plain\n \
    \  text password mechanism using \"anonymous\" as the user name and\n   optional\
    \ trace information, such as an email address, as the\n   password.  As plaintext\
    \ login commands are not permitted in new IETF\n   protocols, a new way to provide\
    \ anonymous login is needed within the\n   context of the SASL [SASL] framework.\n"

- title: 2. Anonymous SASL mechanism
  contents:
  - "2. Anonymous SASL mechanism\n   The mechanism name associated with anonymous\
    \ access is \"ANONYMOUS\".\n   The mechanism consists of a single message from\
    \ the client to the\n   server.  The client sends optional trace information in\
    \ the form of a\n   human readable string.  The trace information should take\
    \ one of\n   three forms: an Internet email address, an opaque string which does\n\
    \   not contain the '@' character and can be interpreted by the system\n   administrator\
    \ of the client's domain, or nothing.  For privacy\n   reasons, an Internet email\
    \ address should only be used with\n   permission from the user.\n   A server\
    \ which permits anonymous access will announce support for the\n   ANONYMOUS mechanism,\
    \ and allow anyone to log in using that mechanism,\n   usually with restricted\
    \ access.\n   The formal grammar for the client message using Augmented BNF [ABNF]\n\
    \   follows.\n   message         = [email / token]\n   TCHAR           = %x20-3F\
    \ / %x41-7E\n                     ;; any printable US-ASCII character except '@'\n\
    \   email           = addr-spec\n                     ;; as defined in [IMAIL],\
    \ except with no free\n                     ;; insertion of linear-white-space,\
    \ and the\n                     ;; local-part MUST either be entirely enclosed\
    \ in\n                     ;; quotes or entirely unquoted\n   token          \
    \ = 1*255TCHAR\n"
- title: 3. Example
  contents:
  - "3. Example\n   Here is a sample anonymous login between an IMAP client and server.\n\
    \   In this example, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate lines sent by the client and\n\
    \   server respectively.  If such lines are wrapped without a new \"C:\" or\n\
    \   \"S:\" label, then the wrapping is for editorial clarity and is not\n   part\
    \ of the command.\n   Note that this example uses the IMAP profile [IMAP4] of\
    \ SASL.  The\n   base64 encoding of challenges and responses, as well as the \"\
    + \"\n   preceding the responses are part of the IMAP4 profile, not part of\n\
    \   SASL itself.  Newer profiles of SASL will include the client message\n   with\
    \ the AUTHENTICATE command itself so the extra round trip below\n   (the server\
    \ response with an empty \"+ \") can be eliminated.\n   In this example, the user's\
    \ opaque identification token is \"sirhc\".\n        S: * OK IMAP4 server ready\n\
    \        C: A001 CAPABILITY\n        S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 AUTH=CRAM-MD5\
    \ AUTH=ANONYMOUS\n        S: A001 OK done\n        C: A002 AUTHENTICATE ANONYMOUS\n\
    \        S: +\n        C: c2lyaGM=\n        S: A003 OK Welcome, trace information\
    \ has been logged.\n"
- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   The anonymous mechanism grants access to information\
    \ by anyone.  For\n   this reason it should be disabled by default so the administrator\
    \ can\n   make an explicit decision to enable it.\n   If the anonymous user has\
    \ any write privileges, a denial of service\n   attack is possible by filling\
    \ up all available space.  This can be\n   prevented by disabling all write access\
    \ by anonymous users.\n   If anonymous users have read and write access to the\
    \ same area, the\n   server can be used as a communication mechanism to anonymously\n\
    \   exchange information.  Servers which accept anonymous submissions\n   should\
    \ implement the common \"drop box\" model which forbids anonymous\n   read access\
    \ to the area where anonymous submissions are accepted.\n   If the anonymous user\
    \ can run many expensive operations (e.g., an\n   IMAP SEARCH BODY command), this\
    \ could enable a denial of service\n   attack.  Servers are encouraged to limit\
    \ the number of anonymous\n   users and reduce their priority or limit their resource\
    \ usage.\n   If there is no idle timeout for the anonymous user and there is a\n\
    \   limit on the number of anonymous users, a denial of service attack is\n  \
    \ enabled.  Servers should implement an idle timeout for anonymous\n   users.\n\
    \   The trace information is not authenticated so it can be falsified.\n   This\
    \ can be used as an attempt to get someone else in trouble for\n   access to questionable\
    \ information.  Administrators trying to trace\n   abuse need to realize this\
    \ information may be falsified.\n   A client which uses the user's correct email\
    \ address as trace\n   information without explicit permission may violate that\
    \ user's\n   privacy.  Information about who accesses an anonymous archive on\
    \ a\n   sensitive subject (e.g., sexual abuse) has strong privacy needs.\n   Clients\
    \ should not send the email address without explicit permission\n   of the user\
    \ and should offer the option of supplying no trace token\n   -- thus only exposing\
    \ the source IP address and time.  Anonymous\n   proxy servers could enhance this\
    \ privacy, but would have to consider\n   the resulting potential denial of service\
    \ attacks.\n   Anonymous connections are susceptible to man in the middle attacks\n\
    \   which view or alter the data transferred.  Clients and servers are\n   encouraged\
    \ to support external integrity and encryption mechanisms.\n   Protocols which\
    \ fail to require an explicit anonymous login are more\n   susceptible to break-ins\
    \ given certain common implementation\n   techniques.  Specifically, Unix servers\
    \ which offer user login may\n   initially start up as root and switch to the\
    \ appropriate user id\n   after an explicit login command.  Normally such servers\
    \ refuse all\n   data access commands prior to explicit login and may enter a\n\
    \   restricted security environment (e.g., the Unix chroot function) for\n   anonymous\
    \ users.  If anonymous access is not explicitly requested,\n   the entire data\
    \ access machinery is exposed to external security\n   attacks without the chance\
    \ for explicit protective measures.\n   Protocols which offer restricted data\
    \ access should not allow\n   anonymous data access without an explicit login\
    \ step.\n"
