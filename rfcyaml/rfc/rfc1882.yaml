  - "Discussion\n   On the first day of Christmas, technology gave to me:\n      \
    \    A database with a broken b-tree (what the hell is a b-tree\n          anyway?)\n\
    \   On the second day of Christmas, technology gave to me:\n          Two transceiver\
    \ failures (CRC errors? Collisions? What is\n          going on?)\n          And\
    \ a database with a broken b-tree (Rebuild WHAT? It's a\n          10GB database!)\n\
    \   On the third day of Christmas, technology gave to me:\n          Three French\
    \ users (who, of course, think they know\n          everything)\n          Two\
    \ transceiver failures (which are now spewing packets all\n          over the\
    \ net)\n          And a database with a broken b-tree (Backup? What backup?)\n\
    \   On the fourth day of Christmas, technology gave to me:\n          Four calls\
    \ for support (playing the same Christmas song over\n          and over)\n   \
    \       Three French users (Why do they like to argue so much over\n         \
    \ trivial things?)\n          Two transceiver failures (How the hell do I know\
    \ which ones\n          they are?)\n          And a database with a broken b-tree\
    \ (Pointer error? What's a\n          pointer error?)\n   On the fifth day of\
    \ Christmas, technology gave to me:\n          Five golden SCSI contacts (Of course\
    \ they're better than\n          silver!)\n          Four support calls (Ever\
    \ notice how time stands still when on\n          hold?\n          Three French\
    \ users (No, we don't have footpedals on PC's. Why\n          do you ask?)\n \
    \         Two transceiver failures (If I knew which ones were bad, I\n       \
    \   would know which ones to fix!)\n          And a database with a broken b-tree\
    \ (Not till next week? Are\n          you nuts?!?!)\n   On the sixth day of Christmas,\
    \ technology gave to me:\n          Six games a-playing (On the production network,\
    \ of course!)\n          Five golden SCSI contacts (What do you mean \"not terminated!\"\
    )\n          Four support calls (No, don't transfer me again - do you HEAR?\n\
    \          Damn!)\n          Three French users (No, you cannot scan in by putting\
    \ the page\n          to the screen...)\n          Two transceiver failures (I\
    \ can't look at the LEDs - they're\n          in the ceiling!)\n          And\
    \ a database with a broken b-tree (Norway? That's where this\n          was written?)\n\
    \   On the seventh day of Christmas, technology gave to me:\n          Seven license\
    \ failures (Expired? When?)\n          Six games a-playing (Please stop tying\
    \ up the PBX to talk to\n          each other!)\n          Five golden SCSI contacts\
    \ (What do you mean I need \"wide\"\n          SCSI?)\n          Four support\
    \ calls (At least the Muzak is different this\n          time...)\n          Three\
    \ French Users (Well, monsieur, there really isn't an\n          \"any\" key,\
    \ but...)\n          Two transceiver failures (SQE? What is that? If I knew I\
    \ would\n          set it myself!)\n          And a database with a broken b-tree\
    \ (No, I really need to talk\n          to Lars - NOW!)\n   On the eighth day\
    \ of Christmas, technology gave to me:\n          Eight MODEMs dialing (Who bought\
    \ these? They're a security\n          violation!)\n          Seven license failures\
    \ (How many WEEKS to get a license?)\n          Six games a-playing (What do you\
    \ mean one pixel per packet on\n          updates?!?)\n          Five golden SCSI\
    \ contacts (Fast SCSI? It's supposed to be\n          fast, isn't it?)\n     \
    \     Four support calls (I already told them that! Don't transfer\n         \
    \ me back - DAMN!)\n          Three French users (No, CTL-ALT-DEL is not the proper\
    \ way to\n          end a program)\n          Two transceiver failures (What do\
    \ you mean \"babbling\n          transceiver\"?)\n          And a database with\
    \ a broken b-tree (Does anyone speak English\n          in Oslo?)\n   On the ninth\
    \ day of Christmas, technology gave to me:\n          Nine lady executives with\
    \ attitude (She said do WHAT with the\n          servers?)\n          Eight MODEMs\
    \ dialing (You've been downloading WHAT?)\n          Seven license failures (We\
    \ sent the P.O. two months ago!)\n          Six games a-playing (HOW many people\
    \ are doing this to the\n          network?)\n          Five golden SCSI contacts\
    \ (What do you mean two have the same\n          ID?)\n          Four support\
    \ calls (No, I am not at the console - I tried that\n          already.)\n   \
    \       Three French users (No, only one floppy fits at a time? Why do\n     \
    \     you ask?)\n          Two transceiver failures (Spare? What spare?)\n   \
    \       And a database with a broken b-tree (No, I am trying to find\n       \
    \   Lars!  L-A-R-S!)\n   On the tenth day of Christmas, technology gave to me:\n\
    \          Ten SNMP alerts flashing (What is that Godawful beeping?)\n       \
    \   Nine lady executives with attitude (No, it used to be a mens\n          room?\
    \ Why?)\n          Eight MODEMs dialing (What Internet provider? We don't allow\n\
    \          Internet here!)\n          Seven license failures (SPA? Why are they\
    \ calling us?)\n          Six games a-playing (No, you don't need a graphics accelerator\n\
    \          for Lotus! )\n          Five golden SCSI contacts (You mean I need\
    \ ANOTHER cable?)\n          Four support calls (No, I never needed an account\

    \ day of Christmas, technology gave to me:\n          Eleven boards a-frying (What\
    \ is that terrible smell?)\n          Ten SNMP alerts flashing (What's a MIB,\
    \ anyway? What's an\n          extension?)\n          Nine lady executives with\
    \ attitude (Mauve? Our computer room\n          tiles in mauve?)\n          Eight\
    \ MODEMs dialing (What do you mean you let your roommate\n          dial-in?)\n\
