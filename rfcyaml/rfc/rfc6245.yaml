  - "Abstract\n   The Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) specification contains a
    Key\n   field, which MAY contain a value that is used to identify a\n   particular
    GRE data stream.  This specification defines a new Mobile\n   IP extension that
    is used to exchange the value to be used in the GRE\n   Key field.  This extension
    further allows the Mobility Agents to set\n   up the necessary protocol interfaces
    prior to receiving the mobile\n   node traffic.  The new extension allows a Foreign
    Agent to request\n   GRE tunneling without disturbing the Home Agent behavior
    specified\n   for Mobile IPv4.  GRE tunneling with the Key field allows the\n
    \  operators to have home networks that consist of multiple Virtual\n   Private
    Networks (VPNs), which may have overlapping home addresses.\n   When the tuple
    <Care of Address, Home Address, and Home Agent\n   Address> is the same across
    multiple subscriber sessions, GRE\n   tunneling will provide a means for the Foreign
    Agent and Home Agent\n   to identify data streams for the individual sessions
    based on the GRE\n   key.  In the absence of this key identifier, the data streams
    cannot\n   be distinguished from each other -- a significant drawback when using\n
    \  IP-in-IP tunneling.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a new extension for use by a Foreign
    Agent\n   (FA) operating Mobile IP for IPv4.  The new extension allows a\n   Foreign
    Agent to request Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)\n   [RFC2784] tunneling without
    disturbing the Home Agent (HA) behavior\n   specified for Mobile IPv4 [RFC5944].
    \ This extension contains the GRE\n   key [RFC2890] required for establishing
    a GRE tunnel between the FA\n   and the HA.\n   GRE tunneling with the Key field
    allows the operators to have home\n   networks that consist of multiple Virtual
    Private Networks (VPNs),\n   which may have overlapping home addresses.  When
    the tuple <Care of\n   Address, Home Address, and Home Agent Address> is the same
    across\n   multiple subscriber sessions, GRE tunneling will provide a means for\n
    \  the FA and the HA to identify data streams for the individual\n   sessions
    based on the GRE key.  In the absence of this key\n   identifier, the data streams
    cannot be distinguished from each other\n   -- a significant drawback when using
    IP-in-IP tunneling.\n"

    - "4.1.  Foreign Agent Requirements for GRE Tunneling Support\n   The FA MUST
      support IP-in-IP tunneling of datagrams for Mobile IPv4\n   [RFC5944].  The
      FA may support GRE tunneling that can be used, for\n   example, to allow for
      overlapping private home IP addresses\n   (Section 4.2.2.5 of [X.S0011-E]).
      \ If the FA is capable of supporting\n   GRE encapsulation, it should set the
      'G' (GRE encapsulation) bit in\n   the Flags field in the Agent Advertisement
      message sent to the Mobile\n   Node (MN) during the Mobile IP session establishment.\n
      \  If the MN does not set the 'G' bit, the FA MAY fall back to using\n   IP-in-IP
      encapsulation for the session per [RFC5944].\n   If the MN does not set the
      'G' bit and does not set the 'D'\n   (Decapsulation by mobile node) bit (i.e.,
      the mobile node does not\n   request GRE tunneling and is not using a co-located
      care-of address),\n   and the local policy allows the FA to override the 'G'
      bit setting\n   received from the MN, the FA MUST include the GRE Key Extension
      as\n   defined in this memo in the Registration Request (RRQ) that it\n   propagates
      to the HA.  The presence of this extension is a request\n   for GRE encapsulation
      that takes precedence over the setting of the\n   'G' bit in the Registration
      Request.  The FA MUST NOT modify the 'G'\n   bit in the Registration Request
      because it is protected by the\n   Mobile-Home Authentication extension.\n   If
      the FA does not support GRE encapsulation, the FA MUST reset the\n   'G' bit
      in the Agent Advertisement message.  In this case, if the MN\n   sets the 'G'
      bit in the Registration Request message, the FA returns\n   a Registration Reply
      (RRP) message to the MN with code 'requested\n   encapsulation unavailable'
      (72) per [RFC5944].\n   If the FA allows GRE encapsulation, and either the MN
      requested GRE\n   encapsulation or local policy dictates using GRE encapsulation
      for\n   the session, and the 'D' bit is not set (i.e., the mobile node is not\n
      \  using a co-located care-of address), the FA MUST include the GRE Key\n   in
      the GRE Key Extension in all Mobile IP Registration Requests\n   (including
      initial, renewal, and de-registration requests) before\n   forwarding the request
      to the HA.  The FA may include a GRE key of\n   value zero in the GRE Key Extension
      to signal that the HA assigns GRE\n   keys in both directions.  The GRE key
      assignment in the FA and the HA\n   is outside the scope of this memo.\n   The
      GRE Key Extension SHALL follow the format defined in [RFC5944].\n   This extension
      SHALL be added after the MN-HA and MN-FA Challenge and\n   MN-AAA (Mobile Node
      - Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)\n   extensions (if any) and
      before the FA-HA Auth extension (if any).\n"

    - "4.2.  Home Agent Requirements for GRE Tunneling Support\n   The HA MUST follow
      the procedures specified in [RFC5944] in\n   processing this extension in Registration
      Request messages.\n   If the HA receives the GRE Key Extension in a Registration
      Request\n   and does not recognize this non-skippable extension, it MUST silently\n
      \  discard the message.  The HA MUST use other alternative forms of\n   encapsulation
      (e.g., IP-in-IP tunneling), when requested by the\n   mobile node per [RFC5944].\n
      \  If the HA receives the GRE Key Extension in a Registration Request\n   and
      recognizes the GRE Key Extension but is not configured to support\n   GRE encapsulation,
      it MUST send an RRP with code 'requested\n   encapsulation unavailable (139)'
      [RFC3024].\n   If the HA receives a Registration Request with a GRE Key Extension\n
      \  but without the 'G' bit set, the HA SHOULD treat this as if the 'G'\n   bit
      is set in the Registration Request; i.e., the presence of a GRE\n   Key Extension
      indicates a request for GRE encapsulation.\n   If the HA receives the GRE Key
      Extension in a Registration Request,\n   and it recognizes the GRE Key Extension
      as well as supports GRE\n   encapsulation, the following procedures should apply:\n
      \  o  The HA SHOULD accept the RRQ and send an RRP with code\n      'registration
      accepted (0)'.\n   o  The HA MUST assign a GRE key and include the GRE Key Extension
      in\n      the RRP before sending it to the FA.\n   o  The HA MUST include the
      GRE Key Extension in all RRPs in response\n      to any RRQ that included the
      GRE Key Extension, when a GRE key is\n      available for the registration.\n
      \  If the HA receives the GRE Key Extension in the initial Registration\n   Request
      and recognizes the GRE Key Extension carrying a GRE key value\n   of zero, it
      SHOULD accept the RRQ and send an RRP with code\n   'registration accepted (0)',
      and the following procedures apply:\n   o  The HA MUST assign GRE keys for both
      directions and include these\n      keys in the GRE Key Extension in the RRP
      before sending it to\n      the FA.\n   o  The HA MUST include the GRE Key Extension
      in the RRP in response\n      to the initial RRQ that included the GRE Key Extension,
      when a GRE\n      key is available for the registration.\n"

    Mobile IP will permit asymmetric GRE\n   keying; i.e., the FA assigns a GRE key
    for use in encapsulated\n   traffic, and the HA can assign its own GRE key.  Once
    the GRE keys\n   have been exchanged, the FA uses the HA-assigned key in the\n
    \  encapsulating GRE header for reverse tunneling, and the HA uses the\n   FA-assigned
    key in the encapsulating GRE header.\n   The format of the GRE Key Extension is
    as shown below.\n   The GRE Key Extension MAY be included in Registration Requests
