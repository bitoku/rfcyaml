  - "Discussion\n   There appears to be some interest in experimenting with subnetting\n\
    \   the class A addresses.\n   There is some evidence that not all the routing\
    \ software in use will\n   deal correctly with subnetted class A addresses.  It\
    \ also appears\n   that actual use of subnetted class A addresses may be necessary\
    \ in\n   the not too distant future.  It is suggested that conducting an\n   experiment\
    \ now to identify and fix any software that does not\n   properly handle subnetted\
    \ class A addresses would be useful and\n   important.\n   To further this experiment\
    \ the IANA will temporarily designate the\n   class A network number 39 to be\
    \ used in the following way:\n   The high order octet of the 4-octet IPv4 address\
    \ is the class A\n   network number 39.  There are two cases for low order 24\
    \ bits.\n   Case 1:\n      In the first case, the high order bit of these 24 bits\
    \ is zero and\n      the next 15 bits are the low order 15 bits of a previously\n\
    \      assigned Autonomous System number (AS), as registered by a network\n  \
    \    registry and listed in the RWhois database system.\n      Using the AS number\
    \ in this way allows the experiment to get\n      underway quickly in that it\
    \ automatically allocates some addresses\n      to each service provider and does\
    \ not require a registration step.\n      One concern is that this might cause\
    \ a run on AS numbers, since by\n      getting an AS number you automatically\
    \ get some address space.\n      This concern should be offset by the fact that\
    \ the amount of\n      address space one gets under this plan is the same as one\
    \ class C\n      network number (and it should be easier to get a single class\
    \ C\n      allocated than to get an AS number allocated), and that this is a\n\
    \      limited time experiment so that these addresses will be temporary.\n  \
    \    The low order octet of the 4-octet IPv4 address is for local use.\n     \
    \ It is expected that an address of this form will be used to\n      identify\
    \ a specific publicly accessible Internet host.\n                +--------+-+-------+--------+--------+\n\
    \                |   39   |0| low 15 bits AS | local  |\n                +--------+-+-------+--------+--------+\n\
    \   Case 2:\n      In the second case, the high order bit of these 24 bits is\
    \ one,\n      and the remaining 23 bits are assigned by the IANA (currently\n\
    \      reserved for future use).\n                +--------+-+-------+--------+--------+\n\
    \                |   39   |1| variable prefix + local |\n                +--------+-+-------+--------+--------+\n\
    \      The general intent is to find a way to assign to experimenters\n      prefixes\
    \ of differing lengths so that a variety of experiments can\n      be conducted\
    \ with the prefix/local-address boundary at different\n      points.\n   It is\
    \ not intended that either of these address allocation schemes is\n   the model\
    \ for how subnetted class A addresses will be actually\n   allocated in the future.\n\
    \   It is expected, to make the experiment interesting, that some\n   providers\
    \ will use these addresses for servers supplying popular\n   material via the\
    \ Web or FTP.\n   For example, if the service provider registered to use AS 690\
    \ wished\n   to use this style of address to provide access to a server of popular\n\
    \   information on local host 7, the address would be:\n                +--------+--------+--------+--------+\n\
    \                |   39   |    2   |   178  |    7   |\n                +--------+--------+--------+--------+\n\
    \   The support for DNS name and address resolution should be provided.\n   For\
    \ example, if Alternet wanted to put up a database of interesting\n   information\
    \ using the hostname \"Interesting.Alter.Net\" using the\n   address 39.2.189.7,\
    \ they would need to put the name to address\n   mapping in their name server\
    \ using the A record\n        Interesting.Alter.Net. IN A 39.2.189.7\n   Similarly,\
    \ the address to name PTR record should be supported\n        7.189.2.39.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\
    \ PTR Interesting.Alter.Net.\n   which means that the 189.2.39 branch of the IN-ADDR\
    \ tree would be\n   delegated to Alternet for the purposes of this experiment.\n\
    \   To support this, the 39.IN-ADDR.ARPA branch is delegated to the IANA\n   to\
    \ be managed at ISI.  The nameserver for this branch is\n   IN-ADDR.EP.NET (39.17.199.10).\
    \  Participants in this experiment\n   should contact the administrator of this\
    \ nameserver to have their\n   portion of the address space further delegated.\
    \  The administrator\n   for this server can be reached at <aexpreg@isi.edu>.\n\
    \   Another aspect of the testing that should be performed is to have\n   providers\
    \ interchange addresses to test the portability of subnetted\n   class A addresses.\
    \  It is not intended that this would be the model\n   for actual use.\n     \
    \ For example, if AS 690 and AS 1800 want to try out routing holes\n      in each\
    \ others' allocations within their AS, that should be\n      encouraged.  That\
    \ is, suppose AS 690 handed some address of their\n      addresses to AS 1800,\
    \ and vice-versa.  This type of testing will\n      be necessary to see if the\
    \ addresses can be made portable in\n      larger sub-A allocations.\n   This\
    \ is experiment will be of limited duration and these addresses\n   may be reassigned\
    \ to other uses when the experiment is over.\n   This experiment will begin on\
    \ 1-May-95.\n   The current date for the termination of this experiment is 1-Dec-95.\n"
