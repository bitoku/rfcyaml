  - "                     Belated Network Meeting Report\nOn 8 May 1970, a Network\
    \ Working Group meeting was hosted at Lincoln Labs.\nThe topics under discussion\
    \ were:\n   1)   Lincoln Lab's Local Interaction Language (LIL)\n   2)   Records,\
    \ Messages, and Format in HOST-HOST information exchange.\n   3)   Miscellaneous\
    \ gripes\nThe first topic is thoroughly summarized in Lincoln Lab's Semi annual\n\
    Technical Summary titled \"Graphics\", dated May 31, 1970 (document id.\nESD-TR-70-151).\n\
    The second topic involved considerable  discussion of NWG/RFC #42 in which\nit\
    \ was proposed that all messages be preceded by an 8-bit type byte which\nwould\
    \ declare the format of the message which followed.\nThe following decisions were\
    \ reached:\n   a)   Records may begin anywhere within a message.\n   b)   The\
    \ first 8 bits of a record are reserved for type information.\n   c)   The first\
    \ transmission on a connection starts a record.\nType 0 is agreed to mean that\
    \ the transmission that follows consists of an\narbitrarily long record, and that\
    \ no further type bytes will be present.\nThe notions of messages and records\
    \ are independent of the flow-control\nprotocol.  Thus the receipt of a message\
    \ does not carry any semantic\nimportance.  The receipt of a record, however,\
    \ may initiate some interpre-\ntation process.\nAfter some discussion, the proposals\
    \ in NWG/RFC #42 were permuted as follows:\n   type 0 = bit string of arbitrary\
    \ length follows\n   type 1 = 8-bit ASCII follows\n   type 2 = EBCDIC follows\n\
    \   type 3 = MOD 33 TTY 7-bit ASCII\n   type 4 = YOUR Local\n            followed\
    \ by another type byte\n   type 5 = MY Local\n            followed by another\
    \ type byte\nThe praise or blame for the preceding decisions rests on the attendees\
    \ at\nthe meeting, to wit:\nE. Ancona (LL)\nT. J. Barkalow (LL)\nD. B. Black (Harvard)\n\
    Jack Bouknight (UI)\nHoward Brodie (MAC)\nVint Cerf (UCLA)\nSteve Crocker (UCLA)\n\

    Joel Winett (LL)\nInstead of sending NWG/RFC's to Chuck Rose at Case University,\
    \ Jim Torson\nwill be receiving them.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n     [ into the online RFC archives by Tammy and\
