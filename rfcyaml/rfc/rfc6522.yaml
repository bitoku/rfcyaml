  - "1.  Introduction\n   [OLD-REPORT] and its antecedent declared the multipart/report
    media\n   type for use within the [MIME] construct to create a container for\n
    \  mail system administrative reports of various kinds.\n   Practical experience
    has shown that the general requirement of having\n   that media type constrained
    to be used only as the outermost MIME\n   type of a message is overly restrictive
    and limits such things as the\n   transmission of multiple administrative reports
    within a single\n   overall message container.  In particular, it prevents one
    from\n   forwarding a report as part of another multipart MIME message.\n   This
    memo removes that constraint.  No other changes apart from some\n   editorial
    ones are made.  Other memos might update other documents to\n   establish or clarify
    the constraints on use of multipart/report in\n   contexts where such are needed.\n
    \  This memo obsoletes RFC 3462.  RFC 3462 and its predecessor, RFC\n   1892,

    \  Restrictions on usage:  none; however, other applications that\n      register
    report types may establish such restrictions.\n   Author:  Murray S. Kucherawy
    <msk@cloudmark.com>\n   Change controller:  IESG\n   The syntax of multipart/report
    is identical to the multipart/mixed\n   content type defined in [MIME].  The report-type
    parameter identifies\n   the type of report.  The parameter is the MIME subtype
    of the second\n   body part of the multipart/report.  (See Section 5.)\n   The
    multipart/report media type contains either two or three sub-\n   parts, in the
    following order:\n   1.  (REQUIRED) The first body part contains a human-readable
    message.\n       The purpose of this message is to provide an easily understood\n
    \      description of the condition(s) that caused the report to be\n       generated,
    for a human reader who might not have a user agent\n       capable of interpreting
    the second section of the multipart/\n       report.  The text in the first section
    can use any IANA-\n       registered MIME media type, charset, or language.  Where
    a\n       description of the error is desired in several languages or\n       several
    media, a multipart/alternative construct MAY be used.\n       This body part MAY
    also be used to send detailed information that\n       cannot be easily formatted
    into the second body part.\n   2.  (REQUIRED) A machine-parsable body part containing
    an account of\n       the reported message handling event.  The purpose of this
    body\n       part is to provide a machine-readable description of the\n       condition(s)
    that caused the report to be generated, along with\n       details not present
    in the first body part that might be useful\n       to human experts.  An initial
    body part, message/delivery-status,\n       is defined in [DSN-FORMAT].\n   3.
    \ (OPTIONAL) A body part containing the returned message or a\n       portion
    thereof.  This information could be useful to aid human\n       experts in diagnosing
    problems.  (Although it might also be\n       useful to allow the sender to identify
    the message about which\n       the report was issued, it is hoped that the envelope-id
    and\n       original-recipient-address returned in the message/report body\n       part
    will replace the traditional use of the returned content for\n       this purpose.)\n
    \  Return of content can be wasteful of network bandwidth and a variety\n   of
    implementation strategies can be used.  Generally, the sender\n   needs to choose
    the appropriate strategy and inform the recipient of\n   the required level of
    returned content required.  In the absence of\n   an explicit request for level
    of return of content such as that\n   provided in [DSN-SMTP], the agent that generated
    the delivery service\n   report SHOULD return the full message content.\n   When
    8-bit or binary data not encoded in a 7-bit form is to be\n   returned, and the
    return path is not guaranteed to be 8-bit or binary\n   capable, two options are
    available.  The original message MAY be\n   re-encoded into a legal 7-bit MIME
    message or the text/rfc822-headers\n   media type MAY be used to return only the
    original message headers.\n"
  title: 3.  The Multipart/Report Media Type
- contents:
  - "4.  The text/rfc822-headers Media Type\n   The text/rfc822-headers media type
    provides a mechanism to label and\n   return only the [MAIL] header of a failed
    message.  The header is not\n   the complete message and SHOULD NOT be returned
    using the message/\n   rfc822 media type defined in [MIME-TYPES].  The returned
    header is\n   useful for identifying the failed message and for diagnostics based\n
    \  on the Received header fields.\n   The text/rfc822-headers media type is defined
    as follows:\n   Type name:  text\n   Subtype name:  rfc822-headers\n   Required
    parameters:  None\n   Optional parameters:  None\n   Encoding considerations:
    \ 7-bit is sufficient for normal mail\n      headers, however, if the headers
    are broken or extended and\n      require encoding to make them legal 7-bit content,
    they MAY be\n      encoded with quoted-printable as defined in [MIME].\n   Security
    considerations:  See Section 7 of [RFC6522].\n   Interoperability considerations:

  title: 6.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Automated use of report types without authentication
    presents several\n   security issues.  Forging negative reports presents the opportunity\n
    \  for denial-of-service attacks when the reports are used for automated\n   maintenance
    of directories or mailing lists.  Forging positive\n   reports can cause the sender
    to incorrectly believe a message was\n   delivered when it was not.\n   A signature
    covering the entire multipart/report structure could be\n   used to prevent such
    forgeries; such a signature scheme is, however,\n   beyond the scope of this document.\n"
