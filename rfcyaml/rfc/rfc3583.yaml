- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobile IP is a technology that allows a \"mobile node\"\
    \ (MN) to change\n   its point of attachment to the Internet while communicating\
    \ with the\n   \"correspondent node\" (CN) using IP.  The formal description of\
    \ Mobile\n   IP can be found in [1, 6].  Mobile IP primarily addresses the correct\n\
    \   routing of packets to MN's current point of attachment with the\n   Internet.\n\
    \   It is also essential to provide proper Quality of Service (QoS)\n   forwarding\
    \ treatment to the packets sent by or destined to MN as they\n   propagate along\
    \ different routes in the network due to node mobility.\n   This document will\
    \ identify the requirements that Mobile IP places on\n   an IP QoS mechanism.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Problem Statement\n   When an MN using Mobile IP undergoes handover from\
    \ one access router\n   to another, the path traversed by MN's packet stream in\
    \ the network\n   may change.  Such a change may be limited to a small segment\
    \ of the\n   end-to-end path near the extremity, or it could also have an end-to-\n\
    \   end impact.  Further, the packets belonging to MN's ongoing session\n   may\
    \ start using a new care-of address after handover.  Hence, they\n   may not be\
    \ recognized by some forwarding functions in the nodes even\n   along that segment\
    \ of the end-to-end path that remains unaltered\n   after handover.  Finally,\
    \ handover may occur between the subnets that\n   are under different administrative\
    \ control.\n   In the light of this scenario, it is essential to establish proper\n\
    \   QoS support for the MN's packet stream along the new packet path.\n"
- title: 1.2.  An approach for solving the QoS problem in Mobile IP
  contents:
  - "1.2.  An approach for solving the QoS problem in Mobile IP\n   There are four\
    \ important steps involved in solving the QoS problem\n   for Mobile IP.  They\
    \ are as follows: (1) List the requirements that\n   Mobile IP places on the QoS\
    \ mechanism, (2) Evaluate current IP QoS\n   solutions against these requirements,\
    \ (3) Decide if current solutions\n   need to be extended, or if new ones need\
    \ to be defined, and (4)\n   Depending on the result of step 3, define new solutions\
    \ or fix the\n   old ones.\n   Of these, the first step, i.e., the requirements\
    \ step, is addressed\n   in this document.  The last three steps are not dealt\
    \ with here in\n   detail.  However, so as to create useful insight into the Mobile\
    \ IP\n   QoS problem, at times this document highlights the shortcomings of\n\
    \   some well known current proposals for establishing QoS support for\n   the\
    \ packet stream in the network, when directly used with Mobile IP.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119 [2].\n"
- title: 3.  Requirements of a QoS solution for Mobile IP
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements of a QoS solution for Mobile IP\n   This section describes the\
    \ requirements for a QoS solution for its\n   satisfactory operation with Mobile\
    \ IP.  Conversely, note that only\n   Mobile IP-specific requirements are described\
    \ here.  We do not assume\n   any particular version (4 or 6) of IP while describing\
    \ the\n   requirements.  Solutions can be designed for IPv4 and IPv6\n   independently,\
    \ or a single solution can be designed to work with both\n   versions.\n   In\
    \ this document, we assume that the target access router for MN's\n   handover\
    \ is already pinned down by other protocols.  For example,\n   Seamoby working\
    \ group has started work on the candidate access router\n   discovery protocols\
    \ [7].  Thus, any QoS-capability specific\n   negotiations that may affect the\
    \ handover decision are outside the\n   scope of QoS solution as such, rather\
    \ need to be performed by\n   candidate and target access router selection protocols.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Performance requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Performance requirements\n   1. Minimize the interruption in QoS at the\
    \ time of handover:\n      At the time of handover, interruption in QoS would\
    \ occur if the\n      packets sent by or destined to the MN arrive at the intermediate\n\
    \      node in the new packet path without that node having information\n    \
    \  about their QoS forwarding requirement.  Then, those packets will\n      receive\
    \ default forwarding treatment.  Such QoS interruption MUST\n      be minimized.\
    \  A good metric for this performance is the number of\n      packets that may\
    \ potentially get served with the \"default\" QoS at\n      the time of handover.\
    \  The number of such packets MUST be\n      minimized.\n      As an example,\
    \ this performance metric is computed in [8] for the\n      case of end-to-end\
    \ RSVP signaling [3] with Mobile IPv6.  It is\n      shown there that when the\
    \ end-to-end path of packets changes at\n      large after handover or when the\
    \ care-of address changes after\n      handover, OPWA (One Pass With Advertisement)\
    \ model of reservation\n      used by RSVP causes the latency of about one round-trip\
    \ time\n      between the MN and the CN before QoS can be established along the\n\
    \      new packet path.  In other words, the packets using the new care-\n   \
    \   of address that would be released by the MN or the CN during one\n      round-trip\
    \ time, after these nodes are ready to use the new care-\n      of address, may\
    \ get default forwarding treatment at the\n      intermediate nodes.  Such a latency\
    \ in QoS programming may be\n      acceptable at the time of session initiation,\
    \ but it is not\n      acceptable in the middle of an active session as would\
    \ be the case\n      with handover.\n   2. Localize the QoS (re)establishment\
    \ to the affected parts of the\n      packet path in the network:\n      In many\
    \ cases, handover changes only a small segment of the end-\n      to-end path\
    \ of MN's packet stream near the extremity.  Then, the\n      QoS mechanism MUST\
    \ limit the extent of QoS (re)establishment to\n      the affected segment of\
    \ the end-to-end path only.\n      However, note that handover may sometimes cause\
    \ the end-to-end\n      path of MN's packet stream in the network to change at\
    \ large.\n      This may happen, for example, in the case of handover between\n\
    \      different administrative domains.  If the QoS mechanism used to\n     \
    \ establish QoS support for the MN's packet stream along the new\n      packet\
    \ path in the network is based on the explicit end-to-end\n      provisioning\
    \ as such, it MUST perform so at the time of such\n      handover.\n      When\
    \ the care-of address changes upon handover, it may be required\n      to perform\
    \ some signaling even over the unchanged part of the\n      end-to-end path if\
    \ the path contains any QoS mechanisms that use\n      IP address as a key to\
    \ forwarding functions.  Examples are FILTER\n      SPECs in the IntServ nodes\
    \ or packet classifiers at the edges of\n      DiffServ networks.  However, double\
    \ provisioning of resources over\n      the unchanged part of the packet path\
    \ MUST be avoided.\n      Note that the QoS signaling protocol such as RSVP [9]\
    \ can localize\n      the QoS signaling to the affected parts of the end-to-end\
    \ path if\n      the care-of address does not change upon handover.  However,\
    \ if\n      the care-of address changes upon handover, RSVP as currently\n   \
    \   defined [4] fails to localize the QoS signaling.  In addition, it\n      will\
    \ cause double reservations on the part of end-to-end path that\n      remains\
    \ unchanged after handover.\n   3. Releasing after handover the QoS state (if\
    \ any) along the old\n      packet path:\n      The QoS mechanism MUST provide\
    \ some means (explicit or timer-\n      based) to release any QoS state along\
    \ the old packet path that is\n      not required after handover.  It is desirable\
    \ that the unwarranted\n      QoS states, if any, along the old path are released\
    \ as quickly as\n      possible at the time of handover.  Note that, during handover,\
    \ the\n      MN may not always get a chance to send explicit tear down message\n\
    \      along the old path because of the loss of link layer connectivity\n   \
    \   with the old access router.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Interoperability requirements
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Interoperability requirements\n   1. Interoperability with mobility protocols:\n\
    \      A number of mobility protocols that are complementary to Mobile IP\n  \
    \    are already defined or may be defined in future in IETF,\n      particularly\
    \ in Mobile IP and Seamoby working groups.  Examples\n      are fast handover\
    \ [10, 11], localized mobility management [12,\n      13], context transfer [5]\
    \ etc.  The QoS mechanism for Mobile IP\n      SHOULD take advantage of these\
    \ mobility protocols for the\n      optimized operation.  However, the QoS scheme\
    \ MUST have provisions\n      to accomplish its tasks even if one or more of these\
    \ mobility\n      protocols are not used.\n   2. Interoperability with heterogeneous\
    \ packet paths as regards QoS\n      paradigms:\n      The new path after handover,\
    \ of the MN's packet stream, may\n      traverse network domains employing different\
    \ QoS paradigms\n      compared to those along the old path.  The QoS mechanism\
    \ for\n      Mobile IP SHOULD be able to establish proper QoS forwarding\n   \
    \   treatment for the MN's packet stream along the packet paths\n      deploying\
    \ different QoS paradigms (best current practices), in a\n      manner consistent\
    \ with the QoS mechanism deployed along those\n      paths.\n      As an illustration,\
    \ suppose that the MN is currently attached to\n      an access router which is\
    \ the edge router of a DiffServ network,\n      and that the packet classifier\
    \ and traffic policer for the MN's\n      flows are presently programmed in this\
    \ access router.  Now,\n      suppose that the MN needs to be handed over to the\
    \ access router\n      which is at the edge of an IntServ network.  The new access\n\
    \      network would expect the exchange of RSVP messages so that proper\n   \
    \   QoS forwarding treatment can be established for the MN's packet\n      stream\
    \ in that access network.  QoS mechanism for Mobile IP SHOULD\n      have provisions\
    \ to handle such heterogeneity as regards the QoS\n      mechanisms deployed along\
    \ different packet paths.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Miscellaneous requirements
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Miscellaneous requirements\n   1. QoS support along multiple packet paths:\n\
    \      After MN undergoes handover from one access router to another,\n      potentially,\
    \ there could be multiple paths over which MN's packet\n      may propagate. \
    \ Examples of these path are: route-optimized path\n      between the MN and its\
    \ CN, triangle route via Home Agent (HA),\n      temporary tunnel between old\
    \ and new access routers, reverse\n      tunnel from the new access router (Foreign\
    \ Agent) to HA etc.  A\n      QoS mechanism SHOULD be able to support QoS along\
    \ the different\n      potential packet paths.  However, whether all paths are\
    \ supported\n      or only a subset of them is supported will be determined by\n\
    \      external mechanisms such as mobility management, policy, location\n   \
    \   privacy requirement and so on.  Further, the same QoS mechanism\n      may\
    \ not be able to support all these paths.\n   2. Interactions with wireless link-layer\
    \ support for QoS:\n      Since a vast number of devices using Mobile IP will\
    \ be connected\n      to the Internet via wireless links, the QoS mechanism for\
    \ Mobile\n      IP MAY provide some information to the wireless link layers for\n\
    \      them to support the required QoS.\n      An example scenario that may benefit\
    \ from such information is that\n      of the two UDP streams associated with\
    \ the same media, but\n      requiring different levels of error protection at\
    \ the wireless\n      link layer due to certain characteristics of their respective\n\
    \      encoding schemes.  The packets of these two streams are equally\n     \
    \ delay sensitive (so as to maintain playout synchronization at the\n      receiver),\
    \ and hence, may be treated equally (as regards queuing)\n      by IP layer. \
    \ But they may need to be transmitted on wireless\n      channels of different\
    \ error characteristics (say different FEC\n      coding or power levels).\n \
    \     The QoS information included for the benefit of wireless link\n      layers\
    \ SHOULD be such that it is meaningful both ways: to\n      applications that\
    \ reside over IP so that they can choose the IP\n      service of certain QoS\
    \ characteristics and to wireless link QoS\n      managers so that they can then\
    \ map this information to the details\n      of lower layer mechanisms and their\
    \ parameters.\n      In the example scenario described above, such a QoS information\n\
    \      could be expressed as the acceptable loss rate of IP packets in\n     \
    \ the UDP stream.  This parameter enables the UDP application to\n      choose\
    \ the IP service having QoS that matches its requirements,\n      and it also\
    \ enables the wireless link QoS managers to choose the\n      right wireless channel\
    \ to transmit the packets of this UDP stream.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Standard requirements
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Standard requirements\n   The QoS solution for Mobile IP SHOULD satisfy\
    \ standard requirements\n   such as scalability, security, conservation of wireless\
    \ bandwidth,\n   low processing overhead on mobile terminals, providing hooks\
    \ for\n   authorization and accounting, and robustness against failures of any\n\
    \   Mobile IP-specific QoS components in the network.  While it is not\n   possible\
    \ to set quantitative targets for these desirable properties,\n   the QoS solution\
    \ MUST be evaluated against these criteria.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The QoS (re)establishment triggered by node mobility\
    \ MUST be guarded\n   against security attacks.  Such attacks could be launched\
    \ by\n   malicious nodes that spoof the QoS signaling to make it appear to the\n\
    \   intermediate nodes that the MN has undergone handover.  Such an\n   attack\
    \ could disrupt the QoS offered to MN's ongoing sessions as the\n   intermediate\
    \ nodes may then tear down the QoS along some segments of\n   the true packet\
    \ paths between MN and CN.  The malicious nodes may\n   also request a reduced\
    \ level of QoS or supply fake packet\n   classifiers, thereby affecting QoS over\
    \ some segments (e.g., that do\n   not get affected by the spoofed handover) of\
    \ the true packet paths\n   between MN and CN.  Further, network resources may\
    \ be wasted or used\n   in an unauthorized manner by the malicious nodes that\
    \ spoof MN's\n   handover.  To prevent this, QoS mechanism MUST provide means\
    \ for\n   intermediate nodes to verify the authenticity of handover-induced QoS\n\
    \   (re)establishment.\n"
