  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides an Applicability Statement for the\
    \ Virtual\n   Private Network (VPN) solution described in [BGP-MPLS-IP-VPN] and\n\
    \   other documents listed in the References section.  We refer to these\n   as\
    \ \"BGP/MPLS IP VPNs\", because Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used\n   to distribute\
    \ the routes, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is\n   used to indicate\
    \ that particular packets need to follow particular\n   routes.  The characteristics\
    \ of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs are compared with\n   the requirements specified in [L3VPN-REQS].\n\
    \   A VPN service is provided by a Service Provider (SP) to a customer\n   (sometimes\
    \ referred to as an enterprise).  BGP/MPLS IP VPNs are\n   intended for the situation\
    \ in which:\n     - The customer:\n         * uses the VPN only for carrying IP\
    \ packets.\n         * does not want to manage a routed backbone; the customer\
    \ may\n           be using routing within his sites, but wishes to outsource\n\
    \           the inter-site routing to the SP.\n         * wants the SP to make\
    \ the backbone and its routing completely\n           transparent to the customer's\
    \ own routing.\n           If the customer has a routed infrastructure at his\
    \ sites, he\n           does not want his site routing algorithms to need to be\
    \ aware\n           of any part of the SP backbone network, other than the\n \
    \          Provider Edge (PE) routers to which the sites are attached.\n     \
    \      In particular, the customer does not want his routers to need\n       \
    \    to be aware of either the native structure of the SP backbone\n         \
    \  or an overlay topology of tunnels through the SP backbone.\n     - The Service\
    \ Provider:\n         * has an IP backbone, with MPLS-enabled edge routers, and\n\
    \           possibly (though not necessarily) with MPLS-enabled core\n       \
    \    routers.\n         * wants to provide a service that meets the customer\n\
    \           requirements above.\n         * does not want to maintain a distinct\
    \ overlay topology of\n           tunnels for each customer.\n   The basic principle\
    \ is to model each VPN as a self-contained\n   \"internet\", where each site makes\
    \ one or more access connections to\n   an SP, sends the SP its routing information,\
    \ and then relies on the\n   SP to distribute routing information to and from\
    \ the other sites in\n   that same VPN.  The service differs from Internet service,\
    \ however,\n   in that the SP strictly controls the distribution of this routing\n\
    \   information so that routes from within a VPN are not sent outside the\n  \
    \ VPN, unless that is explicitly authorized by the customer.  In fact,\n   even\
    \ within the VPN, the distribution of routes may be controlled by\n   the SP so\
    \ as to meet some policy of the customer.\n   The routers at a given customer\
    \ site need not be routing peers of the\n   routers at other customer sites, and\
    \ indeed need not know anything\n   about the internal structure of other customer\
    \ sites.  In fact,\n   different routing protocols may run at the different sites,\
    \ with each\n   site using whatever protocol is most appropriate for that particular\n\
    \   site.\n   If EBGP (the BGP procedures used between BGP speakers from different\n\
    \   Autonomous Systems) is used on the access links that connect a\n   Provider\
    \ Edge router (PE router) to a Customer Edge router (CE\n   router), then the\
    \ SP and the customer do NOT peer in any Interior\n   Gateway Protocol (IGP),\
    \ i.e., intra-domain routing algorithm).\n   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs are optimized for\
    \ the situation in which a customer\n   (an enterprise) expects a service provider\
    \ to operate and maintain\n   the customer's \"backbone\" (i.e., the customer's\
    \ inter-site routing).\n   As such, the service provider becomes a \"business\
    \ partner\" of the\n   enterprise.  The technical mechanisms accommodate the case\
    \ in which a\n   number of closely cooperating SPs can jointly offer the VPN service\n\
    \   to a customer, in that the BGP-based route distribution mechanisms\n   can\
    \ operate between different SPs.  If a set of SPs has sufficient\n   agreements\
    \ with respect to Quality of Service (QoS), Service Level\n   Agreement (SLA),\
    \ etc., then the customer's VPN could have sites\n   attached to different SPs\
    \ from that set.\n   [BGP-MPLS-IP-VPN] specifies the inter-AS (Autonomous System)\n\
    \   mechanisms that allow a single VPN to have sites attached to\n   different\
    \ SPs.  However, the design center is not an environment\n   where a given VPN\
    \ is spread among a very large number (e.g.,\n   hundreds) of SPs.\n   In cases\
    \ where remote offices, individual telecommuters, etc., must\n   use the public\
    \ Internet to access the VPN, it is possible to \"tunnel\"\n   the remote traffic\
    \ to a PE router, and the PE router will treat the\n   traffic as if it had arrived\
    \ over an interface connected to the PE.\n   Remote Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)\
    \ connections can be tunneled via\n   Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) to a PE\
    \ router; IPsec tunnels can\n   also be used to tunnel traffic to a PE router\
    \ across the public\n   Internet.  Of course, when the public Internet is used,\
    \ issues such\n   as QoS and SLAs must be carefully considered.\n   Some customers\
    \ want to connect their sites over the public Internet,\n   creating a VPN \"\
    virtual backbone\", purchasing connectivity for a\n   given site from whatever\
    \ Internet Service Provider (ISP) offers the\n   best price for connecting that\
    \ site.  A BGP/MPLS IP VPN is not an\n   appropriate solution for such customers;\
    \ they instead need to\n   consider solutions (either customer-managed or provider-managed)\
    \ that\n   interconnect their sites via an overlay of secure tunnels across the\n\
    \   Internet.  (See, for example, [IPSEC-VPN].)\n   Some customers who do not\
    \ want to connect their sites via secure\n   site-to-site tunnels across the Internet\
    \ may nevertheless want to\n   maintain complete control over the routing in their\
    \ VPN backbone.\n   These customers will not want a \"managed routing service\"\
    \ such as is\n   provided by BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, since that hides all details of\
    \ the\n   backbone routing and topology from the customer.  Rather, they may\n\
    \   prefer a \"virtual router\" service, in which the tunnels through the\n  \
    \ SP networks are visible as links to the customer's routing algorithm.\n   (See,\
    \ for example, [VR-VPN].)\n"
- title: 2.  SP Provisioning Model
  contents:
  - "2.  SP Provisioning Model\n   If a particular VPN attaches to a particular PE\
    \ router, the SP must\n   configure that PE router with a VPN Routing and Forwarding\
    \ table\n   (VRF), a routing table that is specific to the specified VPN.  (This\n\
    \   is known as a VPN Forwarding Instance (VFI) in the language of\n   [L3VPN-REQS]\
    \ and [L3VPN-FRMWRK].)  Each interface or sub-interface at\n   that PE that attaches\
    \ to a site in the specified VPN (i.e., each\n   local access link of that VPN)\
    \ must be configured so as to be\n   associated with that VRF.  Each such interface\
    \ may be unnumbered or\n   may be assigned an address that is unique within the\
    \ VPN's address\n   space.  In general, a routing algorithm needs to be run on\
    \ each of\n   these links (though static routing can be used instead).  The routing\n\
    \   algorithm can be EBGP, or an IGP such as Routing Information Protocol\n  \
    \ (RIP) or Open Shortest Path First (OSPF).  (IF OSPF is used, the\n   procedures\
    \ of [VPN-OSPF] MUST be implemented.)  If an IGP is run on\n   the access links,\
    \ the IGP MUST be a separate IGP instance, different\n   than the IGP instance\
    \ running among the backbone routers, and\n   different than the IGP instance\
    \ running on the access links of any\n   other VPN.  Static routing is also allowed.\n\
    \   The VRF is populated automatically with routes distributed from\n   locally\
    \ attached CE routers via whatever routing algorithm is run on\n   the PE/CE links.\
    \  It is also populated automatically with routes\n   distributed from other VRFs\
    \ via BGP.  Standard routing decision\n   processes are used to automatically\
    \ select the proper routes.  Static\n   configuration of routes in the VRF is\
    \ optional.\n   Each PE router must run BGP, and must be pre-configured with the\n\
    \   identities of a small set of BGP Route Reflectors, with which it is\n   to\
    \ peer via IBGP.  (\"IBGP\" refers to the BGP procedures used between\n   BGP\
    \ speakers from the same Autonomous System.)\n   In lieu of using Route Reflectors,\
    \ one could configure each PE with\n   the identities of all the other PEs, and\
    \ set up a full mesh of IBGP\n   connections.  While this might be adequate for\
    \ small networks, it\n   would not scale well to large networks; the use of Route\
    \ Reflectors\n   is necessary to achieve scalability.  See section 4.3.3 of\n\
    \   [BGP-MPLS-IP-VPN] for a more complete discussion of the use of Route\n   Reflectors,\
    \ and related scalability mechanisms such as Outbound Route\n   Filtering.\n \
    \  Each VRF must be configured with three parameters:\n     - A Route Distinguisher.\
    \  This is a globally unique 8-byte value.\n       Each VRF may have a unique\
    \ Route Distinguisher (RD), or there may\n       be a single unique RD for an\
    \ entire VPN.  When BGP is used to\n       distribute VPN routing information\
    \ across the SP backbone, this\n       value is prepended to the VPN's IPv4 address\
    \ prefixes, creating a\n       new address family, the VPN-IPv4 address family.\
    \  Thus, even when\n       two VPNs have overlapping IPv4 address spaces, they\
    \ have unique\n       VPN-IPv4 address spaces.\n     - One or more Export Route\
    \ Targets.  A Route Target (RT) is a\n       globally unique 8-byte value that\
    \ BGP carries, as the Extended\n       Communities Route Target attribute, along\
    \ with routes that are\n       exported form the VRF.\n     - One or more Import\
    \ Route Targets.  This RT is used to select\n       routes to be imported from\
    \ other VRFs into this VRF.\n   In the simplest cases and most common cases, the\
    \ Export RT, Import\n   RT, and RD can be identical, and all VRFs in the same\
    \ VPN will\n   distribute routes to each other (a typical intranet).  In more\n\
    \   complex cases, they can be set differently, allowing a very fine\n   degree\
    \ of control over the distribution of routes among VRFs.  This\n   can be used\
    \ to create extranets or to enforce various customer\n   policies.  In complicated\
    \ cases, particular Export RTs can be\n   assigned to particular routes using\
    \ router management mechanisms.\n   One advantage to not requiring the RD to be\
    \ the same as any RT is\n   that this may allow an RD value to be automatically\
    \ determined for\n   each VRF; RT values, on the other hand, must always be configured.\n\
    \   Adding a new site to a VPN is a matter of attaching the site's CE\n   router\
    \ to a PE router, configuring the interface, and, if a VRF for\n   that VPN already\
    \ exists in the PE router, associating that interface\n   with the VRF.  If a\
    \ VRF for that VPN does not already exist in the\n   PE, then one must be configured\
    \ as specified above.  Changes to the\n   configuration of a PE are automatically\
    \ reflected via BGP to the\n   other PEs.\n   The RTs and RDs are made unique\
    \ by being structured as an SP\n   identifier followed by a number which is assigned\
    \ by the identified\n   SP.  SPs may be identified by their AS numbers, or by\
    \ a registered IP\n   address owned by that SP.\n   Although RTs are encoded as\
    \ BGP Extended Communities, the encoding\n   itself distinguishes them from any\
    \ other kind of BGP Extended\n   Community.\n"
- title: 3.  Supported Topologies and Traffic Types
  contents:
  - "3.  Supported Topologies and Traffic Types\n   The scheme is optimized for full\
    \ inter-site connectivity, in the\n   sense that this is what the simplest configurations\
    \ provide.\n   However, the SP has full control, through the mechanism of Route\n\
    \   Targets, of the distribution of routing information among the set of\n   VRFs.\
    \  This enables the SP to provide hub-and-spoke or partial mesh\n   connectivity\
    \ as well as full mesh connectivity.\n   Note that, strictly speaking, the scheme\
    \ does not create a topology,\n   as it does not create layer 2 connections among\
    \ the sites.  It does,\n   however, allow for control over the IP connectivity\
    \ among the sites.\n   It is also possible to constrain the distribution of routing\
    \ in\n   arbitrary ways, e.g., so that data from site A to site B must travel\n\
    \   through a third site C.  (In fact, if it is desired to do so, this\n   level\
    \ of control can be specified at the granularity of a single\n   route.)\n   It\
    \ is possible for some of the routes from a particular customer site\n   A to\
    \ be distributed to one set of remote sites, while other routes\n   from site\
    \ A are distributed to a different set of remote sites.  This\n   is done with\
    \ the Route Target mechanism previously described.\n   Unicast IP traffic is fully\
    \ supported.  Customer IP packets are\n   passed transparently.\n   Multicast\
    \ IP traffic is optionally supported, if the SP provides the\n   optional mechanisms\
    \ of [BGP-MPLS-MCAST-VPN].  There are, however,\n   scaling implications to the\
    \ use of these mechanisms.  Discussion of\n   these implications is deferred.\n\
    \   Non-IP traffic is not supported.  If support for non-IP traffic is\n   necessary,\
    \ either the SP must additionally provide a layer 2\n   tunneling service or the\
    \ customer must use IP tunneling.\n   In general, customer routers at different\
    \ sites do not become routing\n   peers.  However, a customer may, if he so desires,\
    \ allow routers at\n   different sites to be routing peers over a link that is\
    \ NOT part of\n   the VPN service.  Such peering relationships are known as \"\
    IGP\n   backdoors\".  To ensure the proper operation of routing when IGP\n   backdoors\
    \ are present, each VPN route that is distributed by the SP\n   is distributed\
    \ along with a corresponding routing metric.  This\n   enables the customer's\
    \ IGP to compare the \"backdoor routes\" properly\n   with the routes that use\
    \ the SP backbone.  In the particular case\n   where a customer running OSPF within\
    \ his sites wishes to have IGP\n   backdoors, he should run OSPF on the PE/CE\
    \ link, and the PEs should\n   run the procedures of [VPN-OSPF].  (The CEs do\
    \ NOT require any\n   special OSPF procedures.)\n"
- title: 4.  Isolated Exchange of Data and Routing Information
  contents:
  - "4.  Isolated Exchange of Data and Routing Information\n   The Route Target mechanism\
    \ is used to control the distribution of\n   routing information, so that routes\
    \ from one VPN do not get sent to\n   another.  VPN routes are treated by BGP\
    \ as a different address family\n   than general Internet routes.  Routes from\
    \ a VRF do not get leaked to\n   the Internet unless the VRF has been explicitly\
    \ configured to allow\n   it (and this is NOT the default).\n   The way in which\
    \ a particular VPN is divided into sites, or the\n   topology of any particular\
    \ VPN site, is hidden from the Internet and\n   from other VPNs.  (Of course,\
    \ if a particular site can receive\n   Internet traffic, and if it responds to\
    \ traceroute probes from the\n   Internet, then any user of the Internet can learn\
    \ something about the\n   site topology.  The fact that the site is in a VPN does\
    \ not make this\n   any easier or any harder.)\n   Similarly, Internet routes\
    \ do not get leaked into the VPN, unless a\n   VRF of that VPN is explicitly configured\
    \ to import the Internet\n   routes.\n   Proper configuration is essential to\
    \ maintaining the isolation.  In\n   particular, each access link must be associated\
    \ with the proper VRF\n   for that access link, and each VRF must be configured\
    \ with the proper\n   set of RTs.\n   A number of means for exchanging reachability\
    \ information between the\n   PE and CE devices are supported:  static routing,\
    \ EBGP, and RIP are\n   supported by the procedures of [BGP-MPLS-IP-VPN].  If\
    \ the procedures\n   of [VPN-OSPF] and [OSPF-2547-DNBIT] are implemented, OSPF\
    \ may be\n   used.  If OSPF is used between two VPN sites that are in the same\n\
    \   OSPF area, and if it is desired for routes over the VPN backbone to\n   be\
    \ preferred to the OSPF intra-site routes, then the \"sham link\"\n   procedures\
    \ of [VPN-OSPF] must be used.\n   The routing protocols used among the customer\
    \ routers are not in any\n   way restricted by the VPN scheme, as whatever IGP\
    \ is used within the\n   VPN, the PE/CE access links may run EBGP, or may otherwise\
    \ be in a\n   different routing domain than the site's internal links.\n   BGP\
    \ is used for passing routing information among SPs.  BGP may be\n   authenticated\
    \ by use of the TCP MD5 option, or by operating through\n   an IPsec tunnel.\n\
    \   Data traveling between two customer sites is encapsulated while in\n   transit\
    \ through the backbone.  The encapsulation contains sufficient\n   information\
    \ to ensure that the packet is sent to the proper PE\n   router, and then, in\
    \ conjunction with the VRF and related information\n   at that PE, to the proper\
    \ CE routers.\n   If two VPNs attach to the same PE, there is strict separation\
    \ of\n   forwarding at that PE, as well as strict separation of the routing\n\
    \   information.\n   Isolation of traffic is similar to that provided by classical\
    \ L2 VPNs\n   which are based on Frame Relay or Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).\n\
    \   As in classical L2 VPNs, the customer must rely on the SP to properly\n  \
    \ configure the backbone network to ensure proper isolation and to\n   maintain\
    \ the security of his communications gear.\n"
- title: 5.  Access Control and Authentication
  contents:
  - "5.  Access Control and Authentication\n   No particular means of PE/CE authentication\
    \ is specified for BGP/MPLS\n   IP VPNs.  PE/CE mutual authentication may be done\
    \ via any mechanism\n   supported by the routing protocol in which the CE and\
    \ PE are peers\n   (e.g., use of the TCP MD5 authentication when the PE/CE protocol\
    \ is\n   BGP), or by any other mechanism that may be desired.  With such\n   mechanisms\
    \ in place, a CE may not join a VPN until the CE\n   authenticates itself to the\
    \ Service Provider.\n   There is, however, no standardized method that requires\
    \ a CE to\n   authenticate itself to the customer network (rather than to the\
    \ SP)\n   before the CE is allowed to join the VPN.  This is for further study.\n\
    \   No particular means is specified for controlling which user data\n   packets\
    \ can be forwarded by BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  BGP/MPLS IP VPNs are\n   compatible with\
    \ Access Control Lists (ACLs) and any other filtering\n   features that are supported\
    \ on the PE routers.  Routing can be set up\n   so that extranet traffic is directly\
    \ through a firewall, if that is\n   desired.\n   It is possible for various sorts\
    \ of \"tunnel interfaces\" to be\n   associated with a VRF.  In this case, whatever\
    \ authentication is\n   natively used in the establishment of the tunnel interface\
    \ may be\n   used.  For example, an IPsec tunnel can be used as an \"access link\"\
    \n   to attach a remote user or site to a VRF.  The authentication\n   procedure\
    \ in this case is part of IPsec, not part of the VPN scheme.\n   Where L2TP is\
    \ used, each PPP session carried in an L2TP tunnel can be\n   associated with\
    \ a VRF.  The SP's Authentication, Authorization, and\n   Accounting (AAA) server\
    \ can be used to determine the VPN to which the\n   PPP session belongs, and then\
    \ the customer's AAA server can be given\n   the opportunity to authenticate that\
    \ session as well.\n"

    \ transport mode IPsec by the customer is also\n   transparent to the VPN scheme.\
    \  In fact, the VPN scheme is compatible\n   with any use of security by the customer,\
    \ as long as a cleartext IP\n   header is passed from CE to PE.\n   When data\
    \ must cross the Internet to reach the ingress PE router,\n   IPsec tunnels between\
    \ the end user and the PE router can be used; the\n   PE router must then associate\
    \ each IPsec tunnel with the proper VRF.\n   This association would have to be\
    \ based on user-specific information\n   provided by the Internet Key Exchange\
    \ (IKE) protocol, such as a VPN-\n   id.\n   If data is going from one SP network\
    \ to another, and must cross the\n   public Internet to get between those two\
    \ networks, IPsec tunnels can\n   be used to secure the data.  This would require\
    \ bilateral agreement\n   between the two SPs.  BGP connections can also be passed\
    \ through an\n   IPsec tunnel if this is deemed necessary, in order to protect\
    \ user\n   data, by a pair of SPs.  QoS/SLA factors would have to be carefully\n\
    \   considered in this case.\n"

  - "6.2.  SP Security Measures\n   The SP is responsible for preventing illegitimate\
    \ traffic from\n   entering a VPN.  VPN traffic is always encapsulated while traveling\n\
    \   on the backbone, so preventing illegitimate traffic is a matter of\n   ensuring\
    \ that the PE routers to the encapsulation/decapsulation\n   correctly and that\
    \ encapsulations have not been \"spoofed\", i.e., that\n   the encapsulated packets\
    \ were actually encapsulated by PE routers.\n   This requires the SP to take various\
    \ security measures.  The PE and P\n   routers must themselves be secure against\
    \ break-ins (either from\n   someone physically present or from the Internet),\
    \ and neither P nor\n   PE routers should form routing adjacencies to other P\
    \ or PE routers\n   without benefit of some kind of security.  This may be authentication\n\
    \   in the IGP, or physical security.\n   The PE/CE access link should be secured\
    \ in some manner, though the\n   provider may make it the responsibility of the\
    \ customer to ensure\n   that the CE is secure from compromise.  If the PE/CE\
    \ access link is a\n   tunnel over the Internet, then of course some sort of authentication\n\
    \   protocol should always be used.\n   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) sessions\
    \ and BGP sessions between\n   PE and/or P routers should be authenticated.  This\
    \ can be done via\n   the TCP MD5 option or by use of IPsec.\n   If the SP is\
    \ providing the VPN service over an MPLS backbone, it\n   should not accept MPLS\
    \ packets from its external interfaces (i.e.,\n   interfaces to CE devices or\
    \ to other providers' networks) unless the\n   top label of the packet was legitimately\
    \ distributed to the system\n   from which the packet is being received.  If the\
    \ packet's incoming\n   interface leads to a different SP (rather than to a customer),\
    \ an\n   appropriate trust relationship must also be present, including the\n\
    \   trust that the other SP also provides appropriate security measures.\n   If\
    \ the SP is providing the VPN service by using an IP (rather than an\n   MPLS)\
    \ encapsulation, or if it accepts IP-encapsulated VPN packets\n   from other SPs,\
    \ it should apply filtering at its borders so that it\n   does not accept from\
    \ other SPs or from customers any IP packets that\n   are addressed to the PE\
    \ routers, unless appropriate trust\n   relationships are in place.\n   Cryptographic\
    \ authentication of the encapsulated data packets is\n   certainly advantageous\
    \ when there are multiple SPs providing a single\n   VPN.\n   When a dynamic routing\
    \ protocol is run on the link between a CE\n   router and a PE router, routing\
    \ instability in the private network\n   may have an effect on the PE router.\
    \  For example, an unusually large\n   number of routing updates could be sent\
    \ from the CE router to the PE\n   router, placing an unusually large processing\
    \ load on the PE router.\n   This can potentially be used as a Denial-of-Service\
    \ (DoS) attack on\n   the PE router.\n   This issue can be mitigated via resource\
    \ partitioning in the PE, in\n   order to limit the amount of resources (e.g.,\
    \ CPU and memory) that\n   any one VPN is permitted to use in PE routers.  Also,\
    \ rate limits may\n   be applied to the routing traffic sent from the CE to the\
    \ PE.\n   Alternately, when this problem is detected, the CE-to-PE interface\n\
    \   may be shut down.\n   Network management traffic from the CE to the PE may\
    \ be rate limited\n   (for example, to prevent network management traffic from\
    \ CE to PE to\n   be used in a DoS attack).\n"
- title: 6.3.  Security Framework Template
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Security Framework Template\n   Section 9 of [L2VPN-SEC-FRMWRK] provides\
    \ \"a brief template that may\n   be used to evaluate and summarize how a given\
    \ PPVPN [Provider-\n   Provisioned Virtual Private Network] approach (solution)\
    \ measures up\n   against the PPVPN Security Framework\".  It further states \"\
    an\n   evaluation using this template should appear in the applicability\n   statement\
    \ for each PPVPN approach\".  The purpose of this subsection\n   is to provide\
    \ the information in the form required by this template.\n   Security requirements\
    \ that are relevant only to L2VPNs are not\n   applicable and are not further\
    \ discussed.\n     - Does the approach provides complete IP address space separation\n\
    \       for each L3VPN?\n       Yes.\n       The IP address prefixes from a particular\
    \ VPN appear in their\n       native form only in routing tables that are specific\
    \ to the\n       particular VPN.  They are distributed in their native form only\n\
    \       by routing instances that are specific to the particular VPN.\n      \
    \ When address prefixes from different VPNs are combined into a\n       common\
    \ table, or distributed by a common mechanism, the address\n       prefixes are\
    \ first prepended with a Route Distinguisher (RD).\n       The RD is a 64-bit\
    \ quantity, structured so that globally unique\n       RD values can easily be\
    \ created by an SP.  As long as no two VPNs\n       are assigned the same RD value,\
    \ complete IP address space\n       separation is provided.  It is however possible\
    \ for an SP to\n       misconfigure the RD assignments.\n     - Does the approach\
    \ provide complete IP route separation for each\n       L3VPN?\n       Yes.\n\
    \       The distribution of routes is controlled by assigning import and\n   \
    \    export Route Targets (RTs).  A route that is exported from a VRF\n      \
    \ carries an RT specified by the SP as an export RT for that VRF.\n       The\
    \ route can be imported into other VRFs only if the RT that it\n       carries\
    \ has been configured by the SP as an import RT for those\n       other VRFS.\
    \  Thus, the SP has complete control over the set of\n       VRFs to which a route\
    \ will be distributed.  It is of course\n       possible for the SP to misconfigure\
    \ the RT assignments.\n     - Does the approach provide a means to prevent improper\
    \ cross-\n       connection of sites in separate VPNs?\n       This requirement\
    \ is addressed in a way that is beyond the scope\n       of the VPN mechanisms.\n\
    \       In BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, an SP makes a particular site part of a\n       particular\
    \ VPN by configuring the PE router's interface to that\n       site to be associated\
    \ with a particular VRF in that PE.  The VRF\n       is configured with import\
    \ and export RTs, and it is the way in\n       which VRFs are configured with\
    \ RTs in the various PEs that\n       results in a particular set of sites being\
    \ connected as a VPN.\n       Connecting the sites properly in this way is regarded\
    \ as a\n       network management function, and the VPN scheme itself does not\n\
    \       provide a means to prevent misconfiguration.\n       The VPN scheme does\
    \ not provide any particular method for\n       ensuring that a given interface\
    \ from a PE leads to the CE that is\n       expected to be there.  If a routing\
    \ algorithm is run on a\n       particular PE/CE interface, any security procedures\
    \ that the\n       routing algorithm provides (e.g., MD5 authentication of BGP\n\
    \       sessions) can be used; this is outside the scope of the VPN\n       scheme.\
    \  Also, a CE can attach to a PE via an IPsec tunnel, if\n       this is desired,\
    \ for a greater degree of security.\n     - Does the approach provide a means\
    \ to detect improper cross-\n       connection of sites in separate VPNs?\n  \
    \     The base specifications for BGP/MPLS IP VPNs do not provide a\n       means\
    \ for detecting that a site has been connected to the wrong\n       VPN.  However,\
    \ the optional procedure specified in [CE-VERIF]\n       does provide such a means.\
    \  Basically, each PE obtains, via\n       protocol, a secret from each CE to\
    \ which it is directly attached.\n       When the routes from a given CE are distributed,\
    \ the secret from\n       that CE is attached as an attribute of the route.  This\
    \ secret\n       will ultimately be distributed to any other CE that receives\
    \ any\n       route from the given CE.  A CE that is not supposed to be part of\n\
    \       a given VPN will not know the right secret, and if it is\n       connected\
    \ to the given VPN the other CEs in that VPN will realize\n       that a CE that\
    \ doesn't know the proper secret has been connected\n       to the VPN.\n    \
    \ - Does the approach protect against the introduction of\n       unauthorized\
    \ packets into each VPN?\n       We must look separately at the various points\
    \ at which one might\n       attempt to introduce unauthorized packets.\n    \
    \     * Packets arriving at a PE over a PE/CE interface\n           If a given\
    \ PE is directly connected to a given CE, the PE\n           will accept any packets\
    \ that the CE sends it.  The VPN scheme\n           has no special procedures\
    \ for determining that these packets\n           actually came from the CE.  However,\
    \ various means of\n           securing the PE/CE connection can be used (for\
    \ instance, the\n           PE and CE can be connected by an IPsec tunnel) if\
    \ desired.\n           That is, this aspect of the requirement can be addressed\
    \ by\n           means that are outside the scope of the VPN specification.\n\
    \           Once a packet has been accepted from a CE by a PE, the packet\n  \
    \         is routed according to the VRF associated with that PE's\n         \
    \  interface to that CE.  Such packets can only be sent along\n           routes\
    \ that are in that VRF.  There is no way a packet from a\n           CE can be\
    \ routed to an arbitrary VPN.  In particular, there\n           is nothing a VPN\
    \ user can do to cause any particular packet\n           to be sent to the wrong\
    \ VPN.  So this aspect of the\n           requirement is fully addressed.\n  \
    \       * Packets arriving at a PE over an interface from the backbone\n     \
    \      The optional procedures of [MPLS/BGP-IPsec] can be used to\n          \
    \ ensure that a packet that is received by a PE from the\n           backbone\
    \ will not be recognized as a VPN packet unless it\n           actually is one.\
    \  Those procedures also ensure that a\n           received VPN packet came from\
    \ a particular PE and that it\n           carries the MPLS label that that PE\
    \ put on it.  These\n           procedures protect the packet from ingress PE\
    \ to egress PE,\n           but do not protect the PE/CE interfaces.\n       \
    \    If the optional procedures of [MPLS/BGP-IPsec] are not used,\n          \
    \ then the following considerations apply.\n           Undetected corruption of\
    \ the routing information carried in a\n           packet's VPN encapsulation\
    \ can result in misdelivery of the\n           packet, possibly to the wrong VPN.\n\
    \           If a packet enters an SP's network on an interface other than\n  \
    \         a PE/CE interface, the SP should ensure that the packet\n          \
    \ either does not look like a VPN packet or else is not routed\n           to\
    \ a PE router.  This can be done in a variety of ways that\n           are outside\
    \ the scope of the VPN scheme.  For example, IP\n           packets addressed\
    \ to the PE routers can be filtered, MPLS\n           packets (or, e.g., MPLS-in-IP)\
    \ from outside the SP network\n           can be refused, etc.\n           In\
    \ the case of a multi-provider L3VPN backbone, the SP will\n           have to\
    \ know which interfaces lead to SPs that are VPN\n           partners, so that\
    \ VPN packets can be allowed to flow on those\n           interfaces.\n      \
    \     If the public Internet is used as the L3VPN backbone,\n           protection\
    \ against unauthorized packets cannot be achieved by\n           the above measures.\
    \  IPsec tunnels should always be used to\n           carry VPN traffic across\
    \ the public Internet.\n     - Does the approach provide confidentiality (secrecy)\
    \ protection,\n       sender authentication, integrity protection, or protection\n\
    \       against replay attacks for PPVPN user data?\n       If these are desired,\
    \ they must be provided by mechanisms that\n       are outside the scope of the\
    \ VPN mechanisms.  For instance, the\n       users can use secure protocols on\
    \ an end-to-end basis, e.g.,\n       IPsec, Secure Shell (SSH), Secure Sockets\
    \ Layer (SSL), etc.\n     - Does the approach provide protection against unauthorized\
    \ traffic\n       pattern analysis for PPVPN user data?\n       Preventing an\
    \ observer from obtaining traffic pattern analysis\n       from the SP network\
    \ is beyond the scope of the VPN mechanisms.\n     - Do the control protocol(s)\
    \ used for each of the following\n       functions provide for message integrity\
    \ and peer authentication?\n         * VPN membership discovery\n           This\
    \ requirement is fully satisfied.  Membership discovery is\n           done by\
    \ means of BGP.  Control message integrity and peer\n           authentication\
    \ in BGP may be achieved by use of the TCP MD5\n           option.\n         *\
    \ Tunnel establishment\n           The answer to this question depends of course\
    \ on the tunnel\n           protocol and tunnel establishment protocol; a variety\
    \ of\n           different tunneling schemes can be used in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.\n\
    \           Thus, this question is out of scope.\n           In the common case\
    \ where the tunnels are MPLS Label Switching\n           Routers (LSRs) established\
    \ by LDP, then control message\n           integrity and peer authentication may\
    \ be achieved by use of\n           the TCP MD5 option.\n         * VPN topology\
    \ and reachability advertisement\n           With respect to PE-PE interactions,\
    \ the relevant control\n           protocol is BGP, so control message integrity\
    \ and peer\n           authentication can be achieved by use of the TCP MD5 option.\n\
    \           With respect to CE-PE interactions, the answer depends on the\n  \
    \         protocol used for exchanging information between PE and CE,\n      \
    \     as the security mechanisms (if any) of those protocols would\n         \
    \  need to be used.  In the common case where the PE/CE protocol\n           is\
    \ BGP, the TCP MD5 option can be used.\n         * VPN provisioning and management\n\
    \           The protocols procedures for provisioning VPNs and managing\n    \
    \       the PE routers are outside the scope of the VPN scheme.\n         * VPN\
    \ monitoring and attack detection and reporting\n           The protocols and\
    \ procedures for monitoring the VPNs are\n           outside the scope of the\
    \ VPN scheme.\n     - What protection does the approach provide against PPVPN-specific\n\
    \       DoS attacks (i.e., inter-trusted-zone DoS attacks)?\n         * Protection\
    \ of the service provider infrastructure against\n           Data Plane or Control\
    \ Plane DoS attacks originated in a\n           private (PPVPN user) network and\
    \ aimed at PPVPN mechanisms.\n           The PE/CE interfaces of a given VPN will\
    \ generally be\n           addressable from within that VPN.  Apart from that,\
    \ a user\n           within an L3VPN has no more access to the service provider\n\
    \           infrastructure than does any user of the Internet.\n           Therefore,\
    \ we will focus in this section on possible DoS\n           attacks against a\
    \ PE router that may occur when traffic from\n           within a VPN is addressed\
    \ to a PE router.\n           A user within the VPN may address traffic to a PE\
    \ router and\n           may attempt to send an excessive amount of traffic to\
    \ it.\n           Presumably, the PE routers will not accept unauthorized TCP\n\
    \           connections or Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)\n       \
    \    commands, so such traffic will be thrown away; the danger is\n          \
    \ that the PE may need to use a significant proportion of its\n           capacity\
    \ to discard such traffic.  However, this case is no\n           different than\
    \ the case of any SP access router that attaches\n           to subscriber equipment.\
    \  The presence of the VPN mechanisms\n           does not make the PE any more\
    \ or less vulnerable to DoS\n           attacks from arbitrary end users.\n  \
    \       * Protection of the service provider infrastructure against\n        \
    \   Data Plane or Control Plane DoS attacks originated in the\n           Internet\
    \ and aimed at PPVPN mechanisms.\n           DoS attacks of this sort can be prevented\
    \ if the PE routers\n           are not addressable from the Internet.  Alternatively,\
    \ an SP\n           can apply address filtering at its boundaries so that packets\n\
    \           from the Internet are filtered if they are addressed to a PE\n   \
    \        router.\n         * Protection of PPVPN users against Data Plane or Control\
    \ Plane\n           DoS attacks originated from the Internet or from other PPVPN\n\
    \           users and aimed at PPVPN mechanisms.\n           Mechanisms already\
    \ discussed prevent users in a VPN from\n           receiving packets from the\
    \ Internet, unless this is\n           specifically allowed.  In the case where\
    \ it is specifically\n           allowed, it is no different than any other situation\
    \ in which\n           a network is connected to the Internet, and there is no\n\
    \           special vulnerability to DoS attacks due to the L3VPN\n          \
    \ mechanisms.\n           There is nothing to prevent a user in a VPN from mounting\
    \ a\n           DoS attack against other users in the VPN.  However, the\n   \
    \        L3VPN mechanisms make this neither more nor less likely.\n     - Does\
    \ the approach provide protection against unstable or\n       malicious operation\
    \ of a PPVPN user network?\n         * Protection against high levels of, or malicious\
    \ design of,\n           routing traffic from PPVPN user networks to the service\n\
    \           provider network.\n           If a dynamic routing algorithm is running\
    \ on the PE/CE\n           interface, it can be used to mount an attack on the\
    \ PE\n           router, by having the CE present the PE with an excessive\n \
    \          number of routing events.  If an end user within a VPN\n          \
    \ successfully attacks the routing algorithm of the VPN, that\n           might\
    \ also result in an excessive number of routing events\n           being seen\
    \ by the PE router.  This sort of attack can be\n           ameliorated by having\
    \ the PE limit the amount of its\n           resources that can be expended processing\
    \ routing events from\n           a particular VPN.  If the PE/CE routing algorithm\
    \ is BGP,\n           then such mechanisms as route flap damping may be appropriate\n\
    \           as well.\n         * Protection against high levels of, or malicious\
    \ design of,\n           network management traffic from PPVPN user networks to\
    \ the\n           service provider network.\n           A user in a BGP/MPLS IP\
    \ VPN has no more ability than any\n           Internet user to send management\
    \ traffic to the service\n           provider network.\n         * Protection\
    \ against worms and probes originated in the PPVPN\n           user networks,\
    \ sent towards the service provider network.\n           A user in a BGP/MPLS\
    \ IP VPN has no more ability than any\n           Internet user to send worms\
    \ or probes to the service provider\n           network.\n"

  - "10.1.  Internet Access\n   Internet access and VPN access are possible from the\
    \ same site.  This\n   is even possible over the same interface, as long as the\
    \ VPN's\n   internal addresses are distinct from the addresses of the systems\n\
    \   that must be reached via the Internet.  This requires only that\n   Internet\
    \ routes as well as VPN routes be imported into the VRF\n   associated with that\
    \ interface.  This may be as simple as putting a\n   default route to the Internet\
    \ into that VRF.\n   The \"route to the Internet\" that is in a particular VRF\
    \ need not lead\n   directly to the Internet; it may lead to a firewall or other\
    \ security\n   device at another site of the VPN.  The VPN customer can cause\
    \ this\n   to happen simply by exporting a default route from the site with the\n\
    \   firewall.  Generally, a site with a firewall will use a different\n   virtual\
    \ interface for Internet access than for VPN access, since the\n   firewall needs\
    \ to distinguish the \"clean interface\" from the \"dirty\n   interface\".\n \
    \  In such a configuration, the customer would export his routes to the\n   Internet\
    \ via the firewall's dirty interface, but would export the\n   same routes to\
    \ the VPN via the clean interface.  Thus, all traffic\n   from the Internet would\
    \ come through the dirty interface, then\n   through the firewall, and possibly\

    \ routes themselves are carried in BGP as a distinct address\n   family, different\
    \ than the address family that is used to carry\n   \"ordinary\" IP routes.  These\
    \ routes are passed from PE router to\n   Route Reflector to PE router, and are\

- title: 12.  Migration Impact
  contents:
  - "12.  Migration Impact\n   Generally, this means replacement of an existing legacy\

    \ the\n   routes via the VPN backbone preference to routes via the legacy\n  \

- title: 13.  Scalability
  contents:
  - "13.  Scalability\n   There is no upper limit on the number of VPNs per SP network,\
    \ as\n   there is no one box in the SP network that needs to know of all VPNs.\n\
    \   Knowledge of a particular VPN is confined to the PE routers that\n   attach\
    \ to sites in that VPN, and to the BGP Route Reflectors that\n   receive routing\
    \ data from those PEs; other systems maintain no state\n   at all for the VPN.\
    \  Note though that there is no need for any one\n   Route Reflector to know of\
    \ all VPNs.\n   If the SP is providing the VPN service over an MPLS backbone,\
    \ then\n   the backbone IGP must carry a host route for every Label Switched\n\
    \   Path (LSP) egress node within the routing domain.  Every PE router in\n  \
    \ the routing domain is an LSP egress node.  If there are VPNs attached\n   to\
    \ PE routers that are within the routing domain, as well as PE\n   routers that\
    \ are in some second routing domain, then the border\n   routers leading towards\
    \ the second routing domain will also be LSP\n   egress nodes.  Thus, the sum\
    \ of the number of PE routers plus number\n   of border routers within a routing\
    \ domain is limited by the number of\n   routes that can be carried within the\
    \ domain's IGP.  This does not\n   seem to create any practical scalability issue.\n\
    \   There is no upper limit on the number of site interfaces per VPN, as\n   state\
    \ for a particular interface is maintained only at the PE router\n   to which\
    \ that interface attaches.  The number of site interfaces per\n   VPN at a given\
    \ PE router is limited only by the number of interfaces\n   that that PE router\
    \ can support.\n   The number of routes per VPN is constrained only by the number\
    \ of\n   routes that can be supported in BGP, the number of routes that can be\n\
    \   maintained in the PEs that attach to that VPN, and the number of\n   routes\
    \ that can be maintained in the BGP Route Reflectors that hold\n   the routes\
    \ of that VPN.\n   The major constraint in considering scalability is the number\
    \ of\n   routes that a given PE can support.  In general, a given PE can\n   support\
    \ as many VPNs as it has interfaces (including virtual\n   interfaces or \"sub-interfaces\"\
    , not just physical interfaces), but it\n   is constrained in the total number\
    \ of routes it can handle.  The\n   number of routes a given PE must handle depends\
    \ on the particular set\n   of VPNs it attaches to, and the number of routes in\
    \ each such VPN,\n   and the number of \"non-VPN\" Internet routes (if any) that\
    \ it must\n   also handle.\n   The SP may need to engage in significant planning\
    \ to ensure that\n   these limits are not often reached.  If these limits are\
    \ reached, it\n   may be necessary either to replace the PE with one of larger\
    \ capacity\n   or to reorganize the way in which access links lead from CEs to\
    \ PEs,\n   in order to better concentrate the set of access links from sites\n\
    \   that are in the same VPN.  Rehoming a site to a different PE may not\n   involve\
    \ actual rewiring; if the access technology is switched, this\n   is a matter\
    \ of provisioning, but may still be a significant\n   undertaking.  If it is necessary\
    \ to have downtime while performing\n   the rehoming, the customer is impacted\
    \ as well.  Rehoming can also be\n   done \"virtually\", by creating a layer 2\
    \ tunnel from a CE's \"old\" PE\n   to its \"new\" PE.\n   An important consideration\
    \ to remember is that one may have any\n   number of INDEPENDENT BGP systems carrying\
    \ VPN routes.  This is\n   unlike the case of the Internet, where the Internet\
    \ BGP system must\n   carry all the Internet routes.  The difference stems from\
    \ the fact\n   that all Internet addresses must be reachable from each other,\
    \ but a\n   given VPN address is only supposed to be reachable from other\n  \
    \ addresses in the same VPN.\n   Scalability is also affected by the rate of changes\
    \ in the\n   reachability advertisements from CE to PE, as changes reported by\
    \ a\n   CE to its attached PE may be propagated to the other PEs.  BGP\n   mechanisms\
    \ to control the rate of reported changes should be used by\n   the SP.\n   Another\
    \ constraint on the number of VPNs that can be supported by a\n   particular PE\
    \ router is based on the number of routing instances that\n   the PE router can\
    \ support.  If the PE/CE routing is static, or is\n   done by BGP, the number\
    \ of routing protocol instances in a PE device\n   does not depend on the number\
    \ of CEs supported by the PE device.  In\n   the case of BGP, a single BGP protocol\
    \ instance can support all CEs\n   that exchange routing information using BGP.\
    \  If the PE/CE router is\n   done via RIP or OSPF, then the PE must maintain\
    \ one RIP or OSPF\n   instance per VRF.  Note that the number of routing instances\
    \ that can\n   be supported may be different for different routing protocols.\n\
    \   Inter-AS scenarios constructed according to option (b) of section 10\n   of\
    \ [BGP-MPLS-IP-VPN] require BGP \"border routers\" to hold the routes\n   for\
    \ a set of VPNs.  If two SPs share in a small number of VPNs, a\n   single border\
    \ router between them provides adequate capacity.  As the\n   number of shared\
    \ VPNs increases, additional border routers may be\n   needed to handle the increased\
    \ number of routes.  Again, no single\n   border router would handle all the routes\
    \ from all the VPNs, so an\n   increase in the number of VPNs can always be supported\
    \ by adding more\n   border routers.\n   Inter-AS scenarios constructed according\
    \ to option (c) of section 10\n   of [BGP-MPLS-IP-VPN] eliminate the need for\
    \ border routers to contain\n   VPN routes (thus improving scalability in that\
    \ dimension), but at the\n   cost of requiring that each AS have a route to the\
    \ PEs in the others.\n   (Inter-AS scenarios constructed according to option (a)\
    \ of section 10\n   of [BGP-MPLS-IP-VPN] do not scale well.)\n   The solution\
    \ of [BGP-MPLS-IP-VPN] is intended to simplify CE and site\n   operations, by\
    \ hiding the structure of the rest of the VPN from a\n   site, and by hiding the\
    \ structure of the backbone.  Thus, CEs need\n   have only a single sub-interface\
    \ to the backbone, CEs at one site\n   need not even be aware of the existence\
    \ of CEs at another, and CEs at\n   one site need not be routing peers of CEs\
    \ at another.  CEs are never\n   routing peers of P routers.  These factors help\
    \ to scale the\n   customer's network, but limiting the number of adjacencies\
    \ each CE\n   must see, and by limiting the total number of links that the\n \
    \  customer's IGP must handle.\n   The solution of [BGP-MPLS-IP-VPN] is also intended\
    \ to simplify the\n   SP's VPN provisioning, so that potentially the SP will have\
    \ to do\n   little more than say which sites belong to which VPNs.  However, as\n\
    \   the system scales up, planning is needed to determine which PEs\n   should\
    \ home which VPNs, and which BGP RRs should take which VPNs'\n   routing information.\n\
    \   P routers maintain NO per-VPN state at all; the only requirement on\n   them\
    \ is to maintain routes to the PE routers.  When MPLS is used, a P\n   router\
    \ must also maintain one multipoint-to-point LSP for each such\n   route.\n  \
    \ However, certain VPN multicast schemes require per-multicast-group\n   state\
    \ in the P routers, summed over all VPNs.  Others require only no\n   state in\
    \ the P routers at all, but will result in sending more\n   unnecessary traffic.\
    \  The complete set of tradeoffs for multicast is\n   not that well understood\
    \ yet.\n   Note that as the scaling of a particular PE is primarily a matter of\n\
    \   the total number of routes that it must maintain, scalability is\n   facilitated\
    \ if the addresses are assigned in a way that permits them\n   to be aggregated\
    \ (i.e., if the customers have a sensible addressing\n   plan).\n   When a dynamic\
    \ routing protocol is run on the link between a CE\n   router and a PE router,\
    \ routing instability in the private network\n   may have an effect on the PE\
    \ router.  For example, an unusually large\n   number of routing updates could\
    \ be sent from the CE router to the PE\n   router, placing an unusually large\
    \ processing load on the PE router.\n   This issue can be mitigated via resource\
    \ partitioning in the PE, in\n   order to limit the amount of resources (e.g.,\
    \ CPU and memory) that\n   any one VPN is permitted to use in PE routers.  Also,\
    \ rate limits may\n   be applied to the routing traffic sent from the CE to the\
    \ PE.\n   Alternately, when this problem is detected, the CE-to-PE interface\n\
    \   may be shut down.\n"

  - "15.2.  Management by the Customer\n   CE devices may be managed from within the\
    \ VPN, transparently to the\n   SP.  The CE devices have no VPN-specific information\
    \ in them, and the\n   fact that they are tied together into a VPN does not impact\
    \ the\n   customer's management of them.\n   Customer access to a PE device is\
    \ totally at the discretion of the\n   SP, but is not required by the solution.\
    \  The PE device is a routing\n   peer of a CE device, and can be pinged, etc.\n\
    \   If a customer is permitted to access the PE router for management\n   purposes,\
    \ the functions available to any particular customer need to\n   be strictly controlled,\
    \ and the use of resource partitioning may be\n   appropriate.\n   Network management\
    \ traffic from the CE to the PE may be rate limited\n   (for example, to prevent\
    \ network management traffic from CE to PE to\n   be used in a DoS attack).\n"
