    \  94025\n                      Character Generator Process\nI hereby propose\
    \ that there be a standard process implemented on\nwhatever hosts desire which\
    \ generates character data with out any\nregard to input. In some sense the process\
    \ is the converse of the\ndiscard process [RFC 348]. Many hosts have an existing\
    \ terminal\ntesting program [e.g. TTYTST] which would suit this function\nadequately.\n\
    This Character Generator process would listen for a request for\nconnection and\
    \ execute the Initial Connection Protocol (ICP) as\nspecified in NIC 7104 the\
    \ \"Current Network Protocols\" notebook.  Upon\ncompletion of the ICP the Character\
    \ Generator process would begin to\nsend characters into the network as buffer\
    \ space is made available .\nThe Character Generator process is terminated by\
    \ closing the\nconnections.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form\
    \ for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the  \
    \ ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                      1/97 ]\n"
