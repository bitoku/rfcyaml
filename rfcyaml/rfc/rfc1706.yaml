- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   OSI lower layer protocols, comprising the connectionless\
    \ network\n   protocol (CLNP) [5] and supporting routing protocols, are deployed\
    \ in\n   some parts of the global Internet.  Maintenance and debugging of CLNP\n\
    \   connectivity is greatly aided by support in the Domain Name System\n   (DNS)\
    \ [7] [8] for mapping between names and NSAP (network service\n   access point)\
    \ addresses [6] [Note: NSAP and NSAP address are used\n   interchangeably throughout\
    \ this memo].\n   This document defines the format of one new Resource Record\
    \ (RR) for\n   the DNS for domain name-to-NSAP mapping. The RR may be used with\
    \ any\n   NSAP address format.\n   NSAP-to-name translation is accomplished through\
    \ use of the PTR RR\n   (see RFC 1035 for a description of the PTR RR). This paper\
    \ describes\n   how PTR RRs are used to support this translation.\n   This memo\
    \ assumes that the reader is familiar with the DNS. Some\n   familiarity with\
    \ NSAPs is useful; see [1] or Annex A of [6] for\n   additional information.\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   The reason for defining DNS mappings for NSAPs is to support\
    \ the\n   existing CLNP deployment in the Internet.  Debugging with CLNP ping\n\
    \   and traceroute has become more difficult with only numeric NSAPs as\n   the\
    \ scale of deployment has increased. Current debugging is supported\n   by maintaining\
    \ and exchanging a configuration file with name/NSAP\n   mappings similar in function\
    \ to hosts.txt. This suffers from the lack\n   of a central coordinator for this\
    \ file and also from the perspective\n   of scaling.  The former describes the\
    \ most serious short-term\n   problem. Scaling of a hosts.txt-like solution has\
    \ well-known long-\n   term scaling difficiencies.\n"
- title: 3.  Scope
  contents:
  - "3.  Scope\n   The methods defined in this paper are applicable to all NSAP formats.\n\
    \   As a point of reference, there is a distinction between registration\n   and\
    \ publication of addresses. For IP addresses, the IANA is the root\n   registration\
    \ authority and the DNS a publication method. For NSAPs,\n   Annex A of the network\
    \ service definition, ISO8348 [6], describes the\n   root registration authority\
    \ and this memo defines how the DNS is used\n   as a publication method.\n"
- title: 4.  Structure of NSAPs
  contents:
  - "4.  Structure of NSAPs\n   NSAPs are hierarchically structured to allow distributed\n\
    \   administration and efficient routing. Distributed administration\n   permits\
    \ subdelegated addressing authorities to, as allowed by the\n   delegator, further\
    \ structure the portion of the NSAP space under\n   their delegated control. \
    \ Accomodating this distributed authority\n   requires that there be little or\
    \ no a priori knowledge of the\n   structure of NSAPs built into DNS resolvers\
    \ and servers.\n   For the purposes of this memo, NSAPs can be thought of as a\
    \ tree of\n   identifiers. The root of the tree is ISO8348 [6], and has as its\n\
    \   immediately registered subordinates the one-octet Authority and\n   Format\
    \ Identifiers (AFIs) defined there. The size of subsequently-\n   defined fields\
    \ depends on which branch of the tree is taken. The\n   depth of the tree varies\
    \ according to the authority responsible for\n   defining subsequent fields.\n\
    \   An example is the authority under which U.S. GOSIP defines NSAPs [2].\n  \
    \ Under the AFI of 47, NIST (National Institute of Standards and\n   Technology)\
    \ obtained a value of 0005 (the AFI of 47 defines the next\n   field as being\
    \ two octets consisting of four BCD digits from the\n   International Code Designator\
    \ space [3]). NIST defined the subsequent\n   fields in [2], as shown in Figure\
    \ 1. The field immediately following\n   0005 is a format identifier for the rest\
    \ of the U.S. GOSIP NSAP\n   structure, with a hex value of 80. Following this\
    \ is the three-octet\n   field, values for which are allocated to network operators;\
    \ the\n   registration authority for this field is delegated to GSA (General\n\
    \   Services Administration).\n   The last octet of the NSAP is the NSelector\
    \ (NSel). In practice, the\n   NSAP minus the NSel identifies the CLNP protocol\
    \ machine on a given\n   system, and the NSel identifies the CLNP user. Since\
    \ there can be\n   more than one CLNP user (meaning multiple NSel values for a\
    \ given\n   \"base\" NSAP), the representation of the NSAP should be CLNP-user\n\
    \   independent. To achieve this, an NSel value of zero shall be used\n   with\
    \ all NSAP values stored in the DNS. An NSAP with NSel=0\n   identifies the network\
    \ layer itself. It is left to the application\n   retrieving the NSAP to determine\
    \ the appropriate value to use in that\n   instance of communication.\n   When\
    \ CLNP is used to support TCP and UDP services, the NSel value\n   used is the\
    \ appropriate IP PROTO value as registered with the IANA.\n   For \"standard\"\
    \ OSI, the selection of NSel values is left as a matter\n   of local administration.\
    \ Administrators of systems that support the\n   OSI transport protocol [4] in\
    \ addition to TCP/UDP must select NSels\n   for use by OSI Transport that do not\
    \ conflict with the IP PROTO\n   values.\n              |--------------|\n   \

    \ 1: GOSIP Version 2 NSAP structure.\n   In the NSAP RRs in Master Files and in\
    \ the printed text in this memo,\n   NSAPs are often represented as a string of\
    \ \".\"-separated hex values.\n   The values correspond to convenient divisions\
    \ of the NSAP to make it\n   more readable. For example, the \".\"-separated fields\
    \ might correspond\n   to the NSAP fields as defined by the appropriate authority\
    \ (RARE,\n   U.S. GOSIP, ANSI, etc.). The use of this notation is strictly for\n\
    \   readability. The \".\"s do not appear in DNS packets and DNS servers\n   can\
    \ ignore them when reading Master Files. For example, a printable\n   representation\
    \ of the first four fields of a U.S. GOSIP NSAP might\n   look like\n        \
    \                     47.0005.80.005a00\n   and a full U.S. GOSIP NSAP might appear\
    \ as\n             47.0005.80.005a00.0000.1000.0020.00800a123456.00.\n   Other\
    \ NSAP formats have different lengths and different\n   administratively defined\
    \ field widths to accomodate different\n   requirements. For more information\
    \ on NSAP formats in use see RFC\n   1629 [1].\n"

- title: 6.  NSAP-to-name Mapping Using the PTR RR
  contents:
  - "6.  NSAP-to-name Mapping Using the PTR RR\n   The PTR RR is defined in RFC 1035.\
    \ This RR is typically used under\n   the \"IN-ADDR.ARPA\" domain to map from\
    \ IPv4 addresses to domain names.\n   Similarly, the PTR RR is used to map from\
    \ NSAPs to domain names under\n   the \"NSAP.INT\" domain. A domain name is generated\
    \ from the NSAP\n   according to the rules described below. A query is sent by\
    \ the\n   resolver requesting a PTR RR for the provided domain name.\n   A domain\
    \ name is generated from an NSAP by reversing the hex nibbles\n   of the NSAP,\
    \ treating each nibble as a separate subdomain, and\n   appending the top-level\
    \ subdomain name \"NSAP.INT\" to it. For example,\n   the domain name used in\
