In accordance with other specifications, control messages should be an integral number of 8 bit bytes, the length should be specified in the byte count field, and control commands should not be split across messages.
Unresolved was whether to specially limit the length of control messages.
It was agreed to abandon marking and include the text length in the form of a byte count and byte size.
Unresolved was where to begin the first byte of data.
The two choices are: a) have the first data byte begin after 72 bits of leader, byte count, byte size and spacing.
The message format would then be as in the diagram:
When sending a regular message, the Host would send a leader, byte count and byte size and terminate transmission.
The second transmission would be the data.
At the receiving end, the IMP would transmit 64 bits of leader, byte count, byte size and spacing, and stop transmission.
The next transmission would be only the data.
Allocation With respect to the allocation mechanism embodied in the ALL, GVB and RET commands
, two alternatives were proposed: a) make no change.
The flow control algorithm should be changed to keep track of two quantities: messages and bits.
The ALL, GVB, and RET commands each have two data fields.
The ALL command allocates a message limit and a bit limit.
The GVB command contains two fractions, and the RET command returns both messages and bits.
When sending a message, the sending NCP decrements its message counter by 1 and its bit counter by the text length of the message.
The sending NCP may not cause either of its counters to go negative.
The message counter would be 16 bits long.
