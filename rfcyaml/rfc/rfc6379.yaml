    \   (\"UI suites\") for IP Security (IPsec), similar to the two suites\n   specified\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4308] proposes two optional cryptographic user interface\
    \ suites\n   (\"UI suites\") for IPsec.  The two suites, VPN-A and VPN-B, represent\n\
    \   commonly used present day corporate VPN security choices and\n   anticipated\
    \ future choices, respectively.  [RFC4869] proposed four\n   new UI suites based\
    \ on implementations of the United States National\n   Security Agency's Suite\
    \ B algorithms (see [SuiteB]).\n   As with the VPN suites, the Suite B suites\
    \ are simply collections of\n   values for some options in IPsec.  Use of UI suites\
    \ does not change\n   the IPsec protocols in any way.\n   This document reduces\
    \ the scope of the suites in [RFC4869] while\n   retaining the original suite\
    \ names.  A detailed list of the changes\n   is given in Section 6.  This document\
    \ obsoletes RFC 4869.\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  New UI Suites
  contents:
  - "3.  New UI Suites\n   Each of the following UI suites provides choices for ESP\
    \ (see\n   [RFC4303]) and for Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) (see [RFC5996]).\n\
    \   The four suites are differentiated by the choice of cryptographic\n   algorithm\
    \ strengths, and a choice of whether the Encapsulating\n   Security Payload (ESP)\
    \ is to provide both confidentiality and\n   integrity or integrity only.  The\
    \ suite names are based on the\n   Advanced Encryption Standard [AES] mode and\
    \ AES key length specified\n   for ESP.\n   IPsec implementations that use these\
    \ UI suites MUST use the suite\n   names listed here.  IPsec implementations SHOULD\
    \ NOT use names\n   different than those listed here for the suites that are described,\n\
    \   and MUST NOT use the names listed here for suites that do not match\n   these\
    \ values.  These requirements are necessary for interoperability.\n"
