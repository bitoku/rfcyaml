- title: 1. Abstract
  contents:
  - "1. Abstract\n   A class of special-purpose computers has evolved to provide voice\n\
    \   messaging services.  These machines generally interface to a\n   telephone\
    \ switch and provide call answering and voice messaging\n   services.  Traditionally,\
    \ messages sent to a non-local machine are\n   transported using analog networking\
    \ protocols based on DTMF signaling\n   and analog voice playback.  As the demand\
    \ for networking increases,\n   there is a need for a standard high-quality digital\
    \ protocol to\n   connect these machines.  The following document is a profile\
    \ of the\n   Internet standard MIME and ESMTP protocols for use as a digital voice\n\
    \   networking protocol.\n   This profile is based on an earlier effort in the\
    \ Audio Message\n   Interchange Specification (AMIS) group to define a voice messaging\n\
    \   protocol based on X.400 technology.  This protocol is intended to\n   satisfy\
    \ the user requirements statement from that earlier work with\n   the industry\
    \ standard ESMTP/MIME mail protocol infrastructures\n   already used within corporate\
    \ internets.  This profile will be called\n   the voice profile in this document.\n"
- title: 2. Scope and Design Goals
  contents:
  - "2. Scope and Design Goals\n   MIME is the Internet multipurpose, multimedia messaging\
    \ standard.\n   This document explicitly recognizes its capabilities and provides\
    \ a\n   mechanism for the exchange of various messaging technologies\n   including\
    \ voice and facsimile.\n   This document specifies a profile of the TCP/IP multimedia\
    \ messaging\n   protocols for use by special-purpose voice processing platforms.\n\
    \   These platforms have historically been special-purpose computers and\n   often\
    \ do not have facilities normally associated with a traditional\n   Internet Email-capable\
    \ computer.  This profile is intended to specify\n   the minimum common set of\
    \ features and functionally for conformant\n   systems.\n   The voice profile\
    \ does not place limits on the use of additional\n   media types or protocol options.\
    \  However, systems which are\n   conformant to this profile should not send messages\
    \ with features\n   beyond this profile unless explicit per-destination configuration\
    \ of\n   these enhanced features is provided.  Such configuration information\n\
    \   could be stored in a directory, though the implementation of this is\n   a\
    \ local matter.\n   The following are typical limitations of voice messaging platform\n\
    \   which were considered in creating this baseline profile.\n      1) Text messages\
    \ are not normally received and often cannot be\n      displayed or viewed.  They\
    \ can often be processed only via\n      advanced text-to-speech or text-to-fax\
    \ features not currently\n      present in these machines.\n      2) Voice mail\
    \ machines usually act as an integrated Message\n      Transfer Agent and a User\
    \ Agent.  The voice mail machine is\n      responsible for final delivery, and\
    \ there is no relaying of\n      messages.  RFC 822 header fields may have limited\
    \ use in the\n      context of the simple messaging features currently deployed.\n\
    \      3) VM message stores are generally not capable of preserving the\n    \
    \  full semantics of an Internet message.  As such, use of a voice\n      mail\
    \ machine for general message forwarding and gatewaying is not\n      supported.\
    \  Storage of \"Received\" lines and \"Message-ID\" may be\n      limited.\n \
    \     4) Nothing in this document precludes use of a general purpose\n      email\
    \ gateway from providing these services.  However, significant\n      performance\
    \ degradation may result if the email gateway does not\n      support the ESMTP\
    \ options recommended by this document.\n      5) Internet-style mailing lists\
    \ are not generally supported.\n      Distribution lists are implemented as local\
    \ alias lists.\n      6) There is generally no human operator.  Error reports\
    \ must be\n      machine-parsable so that helpful responses can be given to users\n\
    \      whose only access mechanism is a telephone.\n      7) The system user names\
    \ are often limited to 16 or fewer numeric\n      characters.  Alpha characters\
    \ are not generally used for mailbox\n      identification as they cannot be easily\
    \ entered from a telephone\n      terminal.\n   It is a goal of this effort to\
    \ make as few restrictions and additions\n   to the existing Internet mail protocols\
    \ as possible while satisfying\n   the user requirements for interoperability\
    \ with current voice\n   messaging systems.  This goal is motivated by the desire\
    \ to increase\n   the accessibility to digital messaging by enabling the use of\
    \ proven\n   existing networking software for rapid development.\n   This specification\
    \ is intended for use on a TCP/IP network, however,\n   it is possible to use\
    \ the SMTP protocol suite over other transport\n   protocols.  The necessary protocol\
    \ parameters for such use is outside\n   the scope of this document.\n   This\
    \ profile is intended to be robust enough to be used in an\n   environment such\
    \ as the global Internet with installed base gateways\n   which do not understand\
    \ MIME.  It is expected that a messaging system\n   will be managed by a system\
    \ administrator who can perform TCP/IP\n   network configuration.  When using\
    \ facsimile or multiple voice\n   encodings, it is expected that the system administrator\
    \ will maintain\n   a list of the capabilities of the networked mail machines\
    \ to reduce\n   the sending of undeliverable messages due to lack of feature support.\n\
    \   Configuration, implementation and management of this directory\n   listing\
    \ capabilities is a local matter.\n   This specification is a profile of the relevant\
    \ TCP/IP Internet\n   protocols.  These technologies, as well as the specifications\
    \ for the\n   Internet mail protocols, are defined in the Request for Comment\
    \ (RFC)\n   document series.  That series documents the standards as well as the\n\
    \   lore of the TCP/IP protocol suite.  This document should be read with\n  \
    \ the following RFC documents: RFC 821, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol;\n   RFC\
    \ 822, Standard for the format of ARPA Internet Messages; RFC 1521\n   and RFC\
    \ 1522, Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions; RFC 1651, RFC\n   1652, and RFC\
    \ 1653, SMTP Service Extensions (ESMTP); and RFC 1034 and\n   RFC 1035, Domain\
    \ Name System. Where additional functionality is\n   needed, it will be defined\
    \ in this document or in an appendix.\n"
- title: 3. Protocol Restrictions
  contents:
  - "3. Protocol Restrictions\n   This protocol does not limit the number of recipients\
    \ per message.\n   Where possible, implementations should not restrict the number\
    \ of\n   recipients in a single message.  It is recognized that no\n   implementation\
    \ supports unlimited recipients, and that the number of\n   supported recipients\
    \ may be quite low.  However, ESMTP currently does\n   not provide a mechanism\
    \ for indicating the number of supported\n   recipients.\n   This protocol does\
    \ not limit the maximum message length.\n   Implementors should understand that\
    \ some machines will be unable to\n   accept excessively long messages.  A mechanism\
    \ is defined in the RFC\n   1425 ESMTP extensions to declare the maximum message\
    \ size supported.\n   The message size indicated in the ESMTP SIZE command is\
    \ in bytes, not\n   minutes.  The number of bytes varies by voice encoding format\
    \ and\n   must include the MIME wrapper overhead.  If the length must be known\n\
    \   before sending, an approximate translation into minutes can be\n   performed\
    \ if the voice encoding is known.\n"
- title: 4. Voice Message Interexchange Format
  contents:
  - "4. Voice Message Interexchange Format\n   The voice message interchange format\
    \ is a profile of the Internet\n   Email Protocol Suite.  It requires components\
    \ from the message format\n   standard for Internet messages [RFC822], the Multipurpose\
    \ Internet\n   Message Extensions [MIME], the X.400 gateway specification [X.400],\n\
    \   and the delivery report specifications [DRPT][STATUS].\n"
- title: 4.1 Message Addressing Formats
  contents:
  - "4.1 Message Addressing Formats\n   The RFC 822 uses the domain name system. \
    \ This naming system has two\n   components: the local part, used for username\
    \ or mailbox\n   identification; and the host part, used for global machine\n\
    \   identification.\n   The local part of the address shall be an ASCII string\
    \ uniquely\n   identifying a mailbox on a destination system.  For voice messaging,\n\
    \   the local part is a printable string containing the mailbox ID of the\n  \
    \ originator or recipient.  Administration of this space is expected to\n   conform\
    \ to national or corporate private telephone numbering plans.\n   While alpha\
    \ characters and long mailbox identifiers are permitted,\n   most voice mail networks\
    \ rely on numeric mailbox identifiers to\n   retain compatibility with the limited\
    \ 10 digit telephone keypad.\n   For example, a compliant message may contain\
    \ the address\n   2145551212@mycompany.com. It should be noted that while the\
    \ example\n   mailbox address is based on the North American Numbering Plan, any\n\
    \   other corporate numbering plan can be used.  The use of the domain\n   naming\
    \ system should be transparent to the user.  It is the\n   responsibility of the\
    \ voice mail machine to lookup the fully-\n   qualified domain name (FQDN) based\
    \ on the address entered by the\n   user.  The mapping of dialed address to final\
    \ destination system is\n   generally accomplished through implementation-specific\
    \ means.\n   Special addresses are provided for compatibility with the conventions\n\
    \   of the Internet mail system and to facilitate testing.  These\n   addresses\
    \ do not use numeric local addresses, both to conform to\n   current Internet\
    \ practice and to avoid conflict with existing numeric\n   addressing plans. \
    \ Some special addresses are as follows:\n   Postmaster@domain\n   By convention,\
    \ a special mailbox named \"postmaster\" MUST exist on all\n   systems.  This\
    \ address is used for diagnostics and should be checked\n   regularly by the system\
    \ manager. This mailbox is particularly likely\n   to receive text messages, which\
    \ is not normal on a voice processing\n   platform; the specific handling of these\
    \ messages is a individual\n   implementation choice.\n   Loopback@domain\n  \
    \ A special mailbox name named \"loopback\" SHOULD be designated for\n   loopback\
    \ testing.  If supported, all messages sent to this mailbox\n   MUST be returned\
    \ back to the address listed in the From: address as a\n   new message.  The originating\
    \ address of the returned address MUST be\n   \"postmaster\" to prevent mail loops.\n\
    \   These two addresses are RESERVED so they do not conflict with any\n   internal\
    \ addressing plan.\n"
- title: 4.2 Message Header Fields
  contents:
  - "4.2 Message Header Fields\n   Internet messages contain a header information\
    \ block.  This header\n   block contains information required to identify the\
    \ sender, the list\n   of recipients, the message send time, and other information\
    \ intended\n   for user presentation.  Except for specialized gateway and mailing\n\
    \   list cases, headers do not indicate delivery options for the\n   transport\
    \ of messages.\n   The following header lines are permitted for use with voice\
    \ messages.\n   From\n   The originator's fully-qualified domain address (a mailbox\
    \ address\n   followed by the fully-qualified domain name).  The user listed in\n\
    \   this field should be presented in the voice message envelope as the\n   originator\
    \ of the message.\n   Systems conformant to this profile SHOULD provide the text\
    \ personal\n   name of the sender in a quoted phrase if available.  To facilitate\n\
    \   storage of the text name in a local dial-by-name cache directory, the\n  \
    \ first and last name MUST be separable.  Text names in voice messages\n   MUST\
    \ be represented in the form \"last, first, mi.\" [822].\n     Example:\n    \
    \   From: \"User, Joe S.\" <2145551212@mycompany.com>\n     To\n   The TO header\
    \ contains the recipient's fully-qualified domain\n   address.  There may be one\
    \ or more To: fields in any message.\n   Systems conformant to this profile SHOULD\
    \ provide the text personal\n   name of the recipient, if known, in a quoted phrase.\
    \  The name MUST\n   be in the form \"last, first, mi.\" [822].\n     Example:\n\
    \       To: \"User, Sam S.\" <2145551213@mycompany.com>\n   Cc\n   The CC header\
    \ contains additional recipients' fully-qualified domain\n   addresses. Many voice\
    \ mail systems are not capable of storing or\n   reporting the full list of recipients\
    \ to the receiver.\n   Systems conformant to this profile SHOULD provide the text\
    \ personal\n   name of the recipient, if known, in a quoted phrase.  The name\
    \ MUST\n   be in the form \"last, first, mi.\" [822].\n     Example:\n       To:\
    \ \"User, Sam S.\" <2145551213@mycompany.com>\n   Systems conformant to this profile\
    \ may discard the CC list of\n   incoming messages as necessary.  Systems conformant\
    \ to this profile\n   should provide a complete list of recipients when possible.\n\
    \   Date\n   The Date header contains the date, time, and time zone in which the\n\
    \   message was sent by the originator.  Conforming implementations\n   SHOULD\
    \ be able to convert RFC 822 date and time stamps into local\n   time.\n     Example:\n\
    \       Date: Wed, 28 Jul 93 10:08:49 PST\n   The sending system MUST report the\
    \ time the message was sent [822].\n   Sender\n   The Sender header contains the\
    \ actual address of the originator if\n   the message is sent by an agent on behalf\
    \ of the author indicated in\n   the From: field.  Support for this field cannot\
    \ be assumed when\n   talking to a voice system and SHOULD NOT be generated by\
    \ a conforming\n   implementation.\n   While it may not be possible to save this\
    \ information in some voice\n   mail machines, discarding this information or\
    \ the ESMTP MAIL FROM\n   address will make it difficult to send an error message\
    \ to the proper\n   destination [822].\n   Message-id\n   The Message-id header\
    \ contains a unique per-message identifier.  A\n   unique message-id MUST be generated\
    \ for each message sent from a\n   conforming implementation.\n   The message-id\
    \ is not required to be stored on the receiving system.\n   This identifier MAY\
    \ be used for tracking, auditing, and returning\n   read-receipt reports [822].\n\
    \     Example:\n       Message-id: <12345678@mycompany.com>\n   Received\n   The\
    \ Received header contains trace information added to the beginning\n   of a RFC\
    \ 822 message by message transport agents (MTA).  This is the\n   only header\
    \ permitted to be added by an MTA.  Information in this\n   header is useful for\
    \ debugging when using an ASCII message reader or\n   a header parsing tool.\n\
    \   A conforming system MUST add Received headers when acting as a\n   gateway\
    \ and must not remove them.  These headers MAY be ignored or\n   deleted when\
    \ the message is received at the final destination [822].\n   MIME Version\n \
    \  The MIME-Version header indicates that the message is conformant to\n   the\
    \ MIME message format specification. Systems conformant to the\n   voice messaging\
    \ profile MUST include a comment with the words \"(Voice\n   1.0)\" [MIME].\n\
    \     Example:\n       MIME-Version: 1.0 (Voice 1.0)\n   Content-Type\n   The\
    \ content-type header declares the type of content enclosed in the\n   message.\
    \  One of the allowable contents is multipart, a mechanism for\n   bundling several\
    \ message components into a single message.  The\n   allowable contents are specified\
    \ in the next section of this document\n   [MIME].\n   Content-Transfer-Encoding\n\
    \   Because Internet mail was initially specified to carry only 7-bit\n   US-ASCII\
    \ text, it may be necessary to encode voice and fax data into\n   a representation\
    \ suitable for that environment.  The content-\n   transfer-encoding header describes\
    \ this transformation if it is\n   needed.  Conformant implementations MUST recognize\
    \ and decode the\n   standard encodings, \"Binary\", \"7bit, \"8bit\", \"Base-64\"\
    \ and \"Quoted-\n   Printable\".  The allowable content-transfer-encodings are\
    \ specified\n   in the next section of this document [MIME].\n   Sensitivity\n\
    \   The sensitivity header, if present, indicates the requested privacy\n   level.\
    \  The case-insensitive values \"Personal\" and \"Private\" are\n   specified.\
    \ If no privacy is requested, this field is omitted.\n   If a sensitivity header\
    \ is present in the message, a conformant\n   system MUST prohibit the recipient\
    \ from forwarding this message to\n   any other user.  If the receiving system\
    \ does not support privacy and\n   the sensitivity is one of \"Personal\" or \"\
    Private\", the message MUST\n   be returned to the sender with an appropriate\
    \ error code indicating\n   that privacy could not be assured and that the message\
    \ was not\n   delivered [X400].\n   Importance\n   Indicates the requested priority\
    \ to be given by the receiving system.\n   The case-insensitive values \"low\"\
    , \"normal\" and \"high\" are specified.\n   If no special importance is requested,\
    \ this header may be omitted and\n   the value assumed to be \"normal\".\n   Conformant\
    \ implementations MAY use this header to indicate the\n   importance of a message\
    \ and may order messages in a recipient's\n   mailbox [X400].\n   Subject\n  \
    \ The subject field is often provided by email systems but is not\n   widely supported\
    \ on Voice Mail platforms. This field MAY be generated\n   by a conforming implementation\
    \ and may be discarded if present by a\n   receiving system [822].\n"
- title: 4.3 Message Content Types
  contents:
  - "4.3 Message Content Types\n   MIME is a general-purpose message body format that\
    \ is extensible to\n   carry a wide range of body parts.  The basic protocol is\
    \ described in\n   [MIME].  MIME also provides for encoding binary data so that\
    \ it can\n   be transported over the 7-bit text-oriented SMTP protocol.  This\n\
    \   transport encoding is independent of the audio encoding designed to\n   generate\
    \ a binary object.\n   MIME defines two transport encoding mechanisms to transform\
    \ binary\n   data into a 7 bit representation, one designed for text-like data\n\
    \   (\"Quoted-Printable\"), and one for arbitrary binary data (\"Base-64\").\n\
    \   While Base-64 is dramatically more efficient for audio data, both\n   will\
    \ work.  Where binary transport is available, no transport\n   encoding is needed,\
    \ and the data can be labeled as \"Binary\".\n   An implementation in conformance\
    \ with this profile SHOULD send audio\n   data in binary form when binary message\
    \ transport is available.  When\n   binary transport is not available, implementations\
    \ MUST encode the\n   message as Base-64.  The detection and decoding of \"Quoted-\n\
    \   Printable\", \"7bit\", and \"8bit\" MUST be supported in order to meet\n \
    \  MIME requirements and to preserve interoperability with the fullest\n   range\
    \ of possible devices.\n   The following content types are identified for use\
    \ with this profile.\n   Note that each of these contents can be sent individually\
    \ in a\n   message or wrapped in a multipart message to send multi-segment\n \
    \  messages.\n   Message/RFC822\n   MIME requires support of the Message/RFC822\
    \ message encapsulation\n   body part.  This body part is used in the Internet\
    \ to forward\n   complete messages within a multipart/mixed message.  Processing\
    \ of\n   this body part entails trivial processing to decapsulate/encapsulate\n\
    \   the message.  Systems conformant to this profile SHOULD NOT send this\n  \
    \ body part but MUST accept if in conformance with basic MIME.\n   Specific handling\
    \ depends on the platform, and interpretation of this\n   content-type is left\
    \ as an implementation decision [MIME].\n   Text/Plain\n   MIME requires support\
    \ of the basic Text/Plain content type.  This\n   content type has no applicability\
    \ within the voice messaging\n   environment.  Conformant implementations MUST\
    \ NOT send the Text/Plain\n   content-type.  Conformant implementations MUST accept\
    \ Text/Plain\n   messages, however, specific handling is left as an implementation\n\
    \   decision.  One option is to return the message to the sender with a\n   media-unsupported\
    \ error code [MIME].\n   Multipart/Mixed\n   MIME provides the facilities for\
    \ enclosing several body parts in a\n   single message. Multipart/Mixed MAY be\
    \ used for sending multi-segment\n   voice messages, that is, to preserve across\
    \ the network the\n   distinction between an annotation and a forwarded message.\n\
    \   Conformant systems MUST accept multipart/mixed body parts.  Systems\n   MAY\
    \ to collapse such a multi-segment message into a single segment if\n   multi-segment\
    \ messages are not supported on the receiving machine\n   [MIME].\n   Message/Notification\n\
    \   This MIME body part is used for sending machine-parsable delivery\n   status\
    \ notifications.  Conformant implementations must use the\n   Message/Notification\
    \ construct when returning messages or sending\n   warnings.  Conformant implementations\
    \ must recognize and decode the\n   Message/Notification content type and present\
    \ the reason for failure\n   to the user [NOTIFY].\n   Multipart/Report\n   The\
    \ Multipart/Report is used for enclosing a Message/Notification\n   body part\
    \ and any returned message content.  This body type is a\n   companion to Message/Notification.\
    \  Conformant implementations must\n   use the Multipart/Report construct when\
    \ returning messages or sending\n   warnings.  Conformant implementations must\
    \ recognize and decode the\n   Multipart/Report content type [REPORT].\n   Audio/32KADPCM\n\
    \   CCITT Recommendation G.721 [G721] describes the algorithm recommended\n  \
    \ for conversion of a 64 KB/s A-law or u-law PCM channel to and from a\n   32\
    \ KB/s channel.  The conversion is applied to the PCM stream using\n   an Adaptive\
    \ Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) transcoding\n   technique. This algorithm\
    \ will be registered with the IANA for MIME\n   use under the name Audio/32KADPCM.\n\
    \   An implementation conformant to this profile MUST use Audio/32KADPCM\n   by\
    \ default.\n   Proprietary Voice Formats\n   Proprietary voice encoding formats\
    \ or other standard formats may be\n   supported under this profile provided a\
    \ unique identifier is\n   registered with the IANA prior to use.  These encodings\
    \ should be\n   registered as sub-types of Audio.\n   Use of any other encoding\
    \ except Audio/32KADPCM reduces\n   interoperability in the absence of explicit\
    \ manual system\n   configuration.  A conformant implementation MAY use any other\n\
    \   encoding with explicit per-destination configuration.\n   Multipart/Voice-Message\n\
    \   This new MIME multipart structure provides a mechanism for packaging\n   the\
    \ senders spoken name, a spoken subject and, the message.  The\n   multipart provides\
    \ for the packaging of three segments, the first is\n   the spoken name, the second\
    \ is a spoken subject, and the third is the\n   message itself.  Forwarded messages\
    \ can be created by simply nesting\n   multipart content-types (this is also possible\
    \ with Multipart/Mixed\n   if spoken name or spoken subject is not present). \
    \ This type is\n   defined in an appendix to this document.\n   Conforming implementations\
    \ MUST send the Multipart/Voice-Message if a\n   spoken name or spoken subject\
    \ is available.  Conforming\n   implementations SHOULD recognize the Multipart/Voice-Message\
    \ and\n   separate the spoken name or spoken subject.\n"

    \ to send\n   mail and to allow terminal console messaging.  Simple Mail Transport\n\
    \   Protocol (SMTP) was originally created for the exchange of US-ASCII\n   7-bit\
    \ text messages.  Binary and 8-bit text messages have\n   traditionally been transported\
    \ by encoding the messages into a 7-bit\n   text-like form.  [ESMTP] was recently\
    \ published and formalized an\n   extension mechanism for SMTP, and subsequent\
    \ RFCs have defined 8-bit\n   text networking, binary networking, and extensions\
    \ to permit the\n   declaration of message size for the efficient transmission\
    \ of large\n   messages such as multi-minute voice mail.\n   A command streaming\
    \ extension for high performance message\n   transmission has been defined [PIPE].\
    \  This extension reduces the\n   number of round-trip packet exchanges and makes\
    \ it possible to\n   validate all recipient addresses in one operation.  This\
    \ extension is\n   optional but recommended.\n   The following sections list ESMTP\
    \ commands, keywords, and parameters\n   that are required and those that are\
    \ optional.\n"
- title: 5.1 ESMTP Commands
  contents:
  - "5.1 ESMTP Commands\n   HELO\n   Base SMTP greeting and identification of sender.\
    \  This command is not\n   to be sent by conforming systems unless the more-capable\
    \ EHLO command\n   is not accepted.  It is included for compatibility with general\
    \ SMTP\n   implementations. Conforming implementations MUST implement the HELO\n\
    \   command for backward compatibility but SHOULD NOT send it unless EHLO\n  \
    \ is not supported [SMTP].\n   MAIL FROM (REQUIRED)\n   Originating mailbox. \
    \ This address contains the mailbox to which\n   errors should be sent.  This\
    \ address may not be the same as the\n   message sender listed in the message\
    \ header fields if the message was\n   received from a gateway or sent to an Internet-style\
    \ mailing list.\n   Conforming implementations MUST implement the extended MAIL\
    \ FROM\n   command [SMTP, ESMTP].\n   RCPT TO\n   Recipient's mailbox.  This field\
    \ contains only the addresses to which\n   the message should be delivered for\
    \ this transaction.  In the event\n   that multiple transport connections to multiple\
    \ destination machines\n   are required for the same message, this list may not\
    \ match the list\n   of recipients in the message header. Conforming implementations\
    \ MUST\n   implement the extended RCPT TO command [SMTP, ESMTP].\n   DATA\n  \
    \ Initiates the transfer of message data.  Support for this command is\n   required\
    \ in the event the binary mode command BDAT is not supported\n   by the remote\
    \ system.  Conforming implementations MUST implement the\n   SMTP DATA command\
    \ for backwards compatibility [SMTP].\n   TURN\n   Requests a change-of-roles,\
    \ that is, the client that opened the\n   connection offers to assume the role\
    \ of server for any mail the\n   remote machine may wish to send.  Because SMTP\
    \ is not an\n   authenticated protocol, the TURN command presents an opportunity\
    \ to\n   improperly fetch mail queued for another destination.  Conforming\n \
    \  implementations SHOULD NOT implement the TURN command [SMTP].\n   QUIT\n  \
    \ Requests that the connection be closed.  If accepted, the remote\n   machine\
    \ will reset and close the connection.  Conforming\n   implementations MUST implement\
    \ the QUIT command [SMTP].\n   RSET\n   Resets the connection to its initial state.\
    \  Conforming\n   implementations MUST implement the RSET command [SMTP].\n  \
    \ VRFY\n   Requests verification that this node can reach the listed recipient.\n\
    \   While this functionality is also included in the RCPT TO command,\n   VRFY\
    \ allows the query without beginning a mail transfer transaction.\n   This command\
    \ is useful for debugging and tracing problems.\n   Conforming implementations\
    \ MAY implement the VRFY command [SMTP].\n   (Note that the implementation of\
    \ VRFY may simplify the guessing of a\n   recipient's mailbox or automated sweeps\
    \ for valid mailbox addresses,\n   resulting in a possible reduction in privacy.\
    \  Various implementation\n   techniques may be used to reduce the threat, such\
    \ as limiting the\n   number of queries per session [SMTP].)\n   EHLO\n   The\
    \ enhanced mail greeting that enables a server to announce support\n   for extended\
    \ messaging options.  The extended messaging modes are\n   discussed in a later\
    \ section of this document.  Conformant\n   implementations MUST implement the\
    \ ESMTP command and return the\n   capabilities indicated later in this memo [ESMTP].\n\
    \   BDAT\n   The BDAT command provides a higher efficiency alternative to the\n\
    \   earlier DATA command, especially for voice. The BDAT command provides\n  \
    \ for native binary transport.  Because voice messages are large binary\n   objects\
    \ otherwise subject to BASE-64 encoding, BDAT will result in a\n   substantial\
    \ improvement in transmission efficiency over DATA.\n   Conformant implementations\
    \ SHOULD support binary transport using the\n   BDAT command [BINARY].\n"
- title: 5.2 ESMTP Capabilities
  contents:
  - "5.2 ESMTP Capabilities\n   The following ESMTP keywords indicate extended features\
    \ useful for\n   voice messaging.\n   PIPELINING\n   The \"PIPELINING\" keyword\
    \ indicates ability of the receiving SMTP to\n   accept pipelined commands.  Pipelining\
    \ commands dramatically improves\n   the protocol performance over wide area networks.\
    \  Conformant\n   implementations SHOULD support the command pipelining indicated\
    \ by\n   this parameter [PIPE].\n   SIZE\n   The \"SIZE\" keyword provides a mechanism\
    \ by which the receiving SMTP\n   can indicate the maximum size message supported.\
    \  Conformant\n   implementations MUST provide the size capability and SHOULD\
    \ honor any\n   size limitations when sending [SIZE].\n   CHUNKING\n   The \"\
    CHUNKING\" keyword indicates that the receiver will support the\n   high-performance\
    \ binary transport mode.  Note that CHUNKING can be\n   used with any message\
    \ format and does not imply support for binary\n   encoded messages. Conformant\
    \ implementations SHOULD support binary\n   transport indicated by this capability\
    \ [BINARY].\n   BINARYMIME\n   The \"BINARYMIME\" keyword indicates that the receiver\
    \ SMTP can accept\n   binary encoded MIME messages. Conformant implementations\
    \ should\n   support binary transport indicated by this capability [BINARY].\n\
    \   NOTIFY\n   The \"NOTIFY\" keyword indicates that the receiver SMTP will accept\n\
    \   explicit delivery status notification requests.  Conformant\n   implementations\
    \ MUST support the delivery notification extensions in\n   [DSN].\n"

    \ content-types.\n   The syntax of a Multipart/Voice-Message is identical to the\n\
    \   Multipart/Mixed content type.  The Voice-Message content-type\n   contains\
    \ three body parts.  The first is an audio segment containing\n   the spoken name\
    \ of the originator, the second is an audio segment\n   containing a spoken subject,\
    \ and the third is the voice message\n   itself.  Forwarded voice messages can\
    \ be created by simply nesting\n   multipart content types.\n   The spoken name\
    \ segment shall contain the name of the message sender\n   in the voice of the\
    \ sender.  The length of the spoken name segment\n   must not exceed 12 seconds.\
    \  If no spoken name is available, the\n   segment must still be present but may\
    \ be empty.\n   The spoken subject segment shall contain the subject of the message\n\
    \   sender in the voice of the sender.  The length of the spoken subject\n   segment\
    \ must not exceed 20 seconds.  If no spoken subject segment is\n   available,\
    \ the segment must still be present but may be empty.\n   The voice message body\
    \ part may contain any arbitrary content\n   including a multipart/mixed collections\
    \ of body parts, though will\n   typically be an audio segment.\n   The default\
    \ handling of the Multipart/Voice-Message shall be to voice\n   the spoken-name\
    \ segment and then the spoken-subject prior to\n   displaying or voicing the remainder\
    \ of the message.\n"
