  - "1.  Introduction\n   Diffserv-aware MPLS traffic engineering (DS-TE) requirements\
    \ and\n   protocol extensions are specified in [DSTE-REQ, DSTE-PROTO].  A\n  \
    \ requirement for DS-TE implementation is the specification of\n   Bandwidth Constraints\
    \ Models for use with DS-TE.  The Bandwidth\n   Constraints Model provides the\
    \ 'rules' to support the allocation of\n   bandwidth to individual class types\
    \ (CTs).  CTs are groupings of\n   service classes in the DS-TE model, which are\
    \ provided separate\n   bandwidth allocations, priorities, and QoS objectives.\
    \  Several CTs\n   can share a common bandwidth pool on an integrated, multiservice\n\
    \   MPLS/Diffserv network.\n   This document is intended to complement the DS-TE\
    \ requirements\n   document [DSTE-REQ] by giving a functional specification for\
    \ the\n   Maximum Allocation with Reservation (MAR) Bandwidth Constraints\n  \
    \ Model.  Examples of the operation of the MAR Bandwidth Constraints\n   Model\
    \ are presented.  MAR performance is analyzed relative to the\n   criteria for\
    \ selecting a Bandwidth Constraints Model, in order to\n   provide guidance to\
    \ user implementation of the model in their\n   networks.\n   Two other Bandwidth\
    \ Constraints Models are being specified for use in\n   DS-TE:\n   1. Maximum\
    \ Allocation Model (MAM) [MAM] - the maximum allowable\n      bandwidth usage\
    \ of each CT is explicitly specified.\n   2. Russian Doll Model (RDM) [RDM] -\
    \ the maximum allowable bandwidth\n      usage is done cumulatively by grouping\
    \ successive CTs according to\n      priority classes.\n   MAR is similar to MAM\
    \ in that a maximum bandwidth allocation is given\n   to each CT.  However, through\
    \ the use of bandwidth reservation and\n   protection mechanisms, CTs are allowed\
    \ to exceed their bandwidth\n   allocations under conditions of no congestion\
    \ but revert to their\n   allocated bandwidths when overload and congestion occurs.\n\
    \   All Bandwidth Constraints Models should meet these objectives:\n   1. applies\
    \ equally when preemption is either enabled or disabled\n      (when preemption\
    \ is disabled, the model still works 'reasonably'\n      well),\n   2. bandwidth\
    \ efficiency, i.e., good bandwidth sharing among CTs under\n      both normal\
    \ and overload conditions,\n   3. bandwidth isolation, i.e., a CT cannot hog the\
    \ bandwidth of\n      another CT under overload conditions,\n   4. protection\
    \ against QoS degradation, at least of the high-priority\n      CTs (e.g., high-priority\
    \ voice, high-priority data, etc.), and\n   5. reasonably simple, i.e., does not\
    \ require additional IGP\n      extensions and minimizes signaling load processing\
    \ requirements.\n   In Appendix A, modeling analysis is presented that shows the\
    \ MAR\n   Model meets all of these objectives and provides good network\n   performance,\
    \ relative to MAM and full-sharing models, under normal\n   and abnormal operating\
    \ conditions.  It is demonstrated that MAR\n   simultaneously achieves bandwidth\
    \ efficiency, bandwidth isolation,\n   and protection against QoS degradation\
    \ without preemption.\n   In Section 3 we give the assumptions and applicability;\
    \ in Section 4\n   a functional specification of the MAR Bandwidth Constraints\
    \ Model;\n   and in Section 5 we give examples of its operation.  In Appendix\
    \ A,\n   MAR performance is analyzed relative to the criteria for selecting a\n\
    \   Bandwidth Constraints Model, in order to provide guidance to user\n   implementation\
    \ of the model in their networks.  In Appendix B,\n   bandwidth prediction for\
    \ path computation is discussed.\n"

    \ simultaneously, under the assumption that\n   Shared Mesh Restoration operates\
    \ independently within each DS-TE\n   Class-Type and does not operate across Class-Types.\
    \  For example,\n   backup LSPs protecting primary LSPs of CTc also need to belong\
    \ to\n   CTc; excess traffic LSPs that share bandwidth with backup LSPs of CTc\n\
    \   also need to belong to CTc.\n"
- title: 3.  Assumptions & Applicability
  contents:
  - "3.  Assumptions & Applicability\n   In general, DS-TE is a bandwidth allocation\
    \ mechanism for different\n   classes of traffic allocated to various CTs (e.g.,\
    \ voice, normal\n   data, best-effort data).  Network operation functions such\
    \ as\n   capacity design, bandwidth allocation, routing design, and network\n\
    \   planning are normally based on traffic-measured load and forecast\n   [ASH1].\n\
    \   As such, the following assumptions are made according to the\n   operation\
    \ of MAR:\n   1. Connection admission control (CAC) allocates bandwidth for network\n\
    \      flows/LSPs according to the traffic load assigned to each CT,\n      based\
    \ on traffic measurement and forecast.\n   2. CAC could allocate bandwidth per\
    \ flow, per LSP, per traffic trunk,\n      or otherwise.  That is, no specific\
    \ assumption is made about a\n      specific CAC method, except that CT bandwidth\
    \ allocation is\n      related to the measured/forecasted traffic load, as per\
    \ assumption\n      #1.\n   3. CT bandwidth allocation is adjusted up or down\
    \ according to\n      measured/forecast traffic load.  No specific time period\
    \ is\n      assumed for this adjustment, it could be short term (seconds,\n  \
    \    minutes, hours), daily, weekly, monthly, or otherwise.\n   4. Capacity management\
    \ and CT bandwidth allocation thresholds (e.g.,\n      BCc) are designed according\
    \ to traffic load, and are based on\n      traffic measurement and forecast. \
    \ Again, no specific time period\n      is assumed for this adjustment, it could\
    \ be short term (hours),\n      daily, weekly, monthly, or otherwise.\n   5. No\
    \ assumption is made on the order in which traffic is allocated\n      to various\
    \ CTs; again traffic allocation is assumed to be based\n      only on traffic\
    \ load as it is measured and/or forecast.\n   6. If link bandwidth is exhausted\
    \ on a given path for a\n      flow/LSP/traffic trunk, alternate paths may be\
    \ attempted to\n      satisfy CT bandwidth allocation.\n   Note that the above\
    \ assumptions are not unique to MAR, but are\n   generic, common assumptions for\
    \ all BC Models.\n"

  - "4.  Functional Specification of the MAR Bandwidth Constraints Model\n   A DS-TE\
    \ Label Switching Router (LSR) that implements MAR MUST support\n   enforcement\
    \ of bandwidth constraints, in compliance with the\n   specifications in this\
    \ section.\n   In the MAR Bandwidth Constraints Model, the bandwidth allocation\n\
    \   control for each CT is based on estimated bandwidth needs, bandwidth\n   use,\
    \ and status of links.  The Label Edge Router (LER) makes needed\n   bandwidth\
    \ allocation changes, and uses [RSVP-TE], for example, to\n   determine if link\
    \ bandwidth can be allocated to a CT.  Bandwidth\n   allocated to individual CTs\
    \ is protected as needed, but otherwise it\n   is shared.  Under normal, non-congested\
    \ network conditions, all\n   CTs/services fully share all available bandwidth.\
    \  When congestion\n   occurs for a particular CTc, bandwidth reservation prohibits\
    \ traffic\n   from other CTs from seizing the allocated capacity for CTc.\n  \
    \ On a given link k, a small amount of bandwidth RBW_THRESk (the\n   reservation\
    \ bandwidth threshold for link k) is reserved and governs\n   the admission control\
    \ on link k.  Also associated with each CTc on\n   link k are the allocated bandwidth\
    \ constraints BCck to govern\n   bandwidth allocation and protection.  The reservation\
    \ bandwidth on a\n   link (RBW_THRESk) can be accessed when a given CTc has bandwidth-in-\n\
    \   use (RESERVED_BWck) below its allocated bandwidth constraint (BCck).\n   However,\
    \ if RESERVED_BWck exceeds its allocated bandwidth constraint\n   (BCck), then\
    \ the reservation bandwidth (RBW_THRESk) cannot be\n   accessed.  In this way,\
    \ bandwidth can be fully shared among CTs if\n   available, but is otherwise protected\
    \ by bandwidth reservation\n   methods.\n   Bandwidth can be accessed for a bandwidth\
    \ request = DBW for CTc on a\n   given link k based on the following rules:\n\
    \   Table 1: Rules for Admitting LSP Bandwidth Request = DBW on Link k\n   For\
    \ LSP on a high priority or normal priority CTc:\n  If RESERVED_BWck <= BCck:\
    \ admit if DBW <= UNRESERVED_BWk\n  If RESERVED_BWck > BCck:  admit if DBW <=\
    \ UNRESERVED_BWk - RBW_THRESk;\n   or, equivalently:\n   If DBW <= UNRESERVED_BWck,\
    \ admit the LSP.\n   For LSP on a best-effort priority CTc:\n   allocated bandwidth\
    \ BCck = 0;\n   Diffserv queuing admits BE packets only if there is available\
    \ link\n   bandwidth.\n   The normal semantics of setup and holding priority are\
    \ applied in the\n   MAR Bandwidth Constraints Model, and cross-CT preemption\
    \ is permitted\n   when preemption is enabled.\n   The bandwidth allocation rules\
    \ defined in Table 1 are illustrated\n   with an example in Section 6 and simulation\
    \ analysis in Appendix A.\n"

    \ allocated to high\n   priority CTs should be a relatively small fraction of\
    \ the total link\n   bandwidth, with a maximum of 10-15 percent being a reasonable\n\
    \   guideline.\n   As stated in Section 4, the bandwidth allocated to a best-effort\n\
    \   priority CTc should be set to zero.  That is:\n   For best-effort priority\
    \ CTc:\n   BCck = 0\n"
- title: 6.  Example of MAR Operation
  contents:
  - "6.  Example of MAR Operation\n   In the example, assume there are three class-types:\
    \ CT0, CT1, CT2.\n   We consider a particular link with\n   MAX-RESERVABLE_BW\
    \ = 100\n   And with the allocated bandwidth constraints set as follows:\n   BC0\
    \ = 30\n   BC1 = 20\n   BC2 = 20\n   These bandwidth constraints are based on\
    \ the normal traffic loads, as\n   discussed in Section 5.  With MAR, any of the\
    \ CTs is allowed to\n   exceed its bandwidth constraint (BCc) as long a there\
    \ are at least\n   RBW_THRES (reservation bandwidth threshold on the link) units\
    \ of\n   spare bandwidth remaining.  Let's assume\n   RBW_THRES = 10\n   So under\
    \ overload, if\n   RESERVED_BW0 = 50\n   RESERVED_BW1 = 30\n   RESERVED_BW2 =\
    \ 10\n   Therefore, for this loading\n   UNRESERVED_BW = 100 - 50 - 30 - 10 =\
    \ 10\n   CT0 and CT1 can no longer increase their bandwidth on the link,\n   because\
    \ they are above their BC values and there is only RBW_THRES=10\n   units of spare\
    \ bandwidth left on the link.  But CT2 can take the\n   additional bandwidth (up\
    \ to 10 units) if the demand arrives, because\n   it is below its BC value.\n\
    \   As also discussed in Section 4, if best effort traffic is present, it\n  \
    \ can always seize whatever spare bandwidth is available on the link at\n   the\
    \ moment, but is subject to being lost at the queues in favor of\n   the higher\
    \ priority traffic.\n   Let's say an LSP arrives for CT0 needing 5 units of bandwidth\
    \ (i.e.,\n   DBW = 5).  We need to decide, based on Table 1, whether to admit\
    \ this\n   LSP or not.  Since for CT0\n   RESERVED_BW0 > BC0 (50 > 30), and\n\
    \   DBW > UNRESERVED_BW - RBW_THRES (i.e., 5 > 10 - 10)\n   Table 1 says the LSP\
    \ is rejected/blocked.\n   Now let's say an LSP arrives for CT2 needing 5 units\
    \ of bandwidth\n   (i.e., DBW = 5).  We need to decide based on Table 1 whether\
    \ to admit\n   this LSP or not.  Since for CT2\n   RESERVED_BW2 < BC2 (10 < 20),\
    \ and\n   DBW < UNRESERVED_BW (i.e., 5 < 10)\n   Table 1 says to admit the LSP.\n\
    \   Hence, in the above example, in the current state of the link and in\n   the\
    \ current CT loading, CT0 and CT1 can no longer increase their\n   bandwidth on\
    \ the link, because they are above their BCc values and\n   there is only RBW_THRES=10\
    \ units of spare bandwidth left on the link.\n   But CT2 can take the additional\
    \ bandwidth (up to 10 units) if the\n   demand arrives, because it is below its\
    \ BCc value.\n"

    \ full sharing of bandwidth,\n   3. differentiation between high-priority, normal-priority,\

  - "A.1.  MAR Operation\n   In the MAR Bandwidth Constraints Model, the bandwidth\
    \ allocation\n   control for each CT is based on estimated bandwidth needs, bandwidth\n\
    \   use, and status of links.  The LER makes needed bandwidth allocation\n   changes,\
    \ and uses [RSVP-TE], for example, to determine if link\n   bandwidth can be allocated\
    \ to a CT.  Bandwidth allocated to\n   individual CTs is protected as needed,\
    \ but otherwise it is shared.\n   Under normal, non-congested network conditions,\
    \ all CTs/services\n   fully share all available bandwidth.  When congestion occurs\
    \ for a\n   particular CTc, bandwidth reservation acts to prohibit traffic from\n\
    \   other CTs from seizing the allocated capacity for CTc.  Associated\n   with\
    \ each CT is the allocated bandwidth constraint (BCc) which\n   governs bandwidth\
    \ allocation and protection; these parameters are\n   illustrated with examples\
    \ in this Appendix.\n   In performing MAR bandwidth allocation for a given flow/LSP,\
    \ the LER\n   first determines the egress LSR address, service-identity, and CT.\n\
    \   The connection request is allocated an equivalent bandwidth to be\n   routed\
    \ on a particular CT.  The LER then accesses the CT priority,\n   QoS/traffic\
    \ parameters, and routing table between the LER and egress\n   LSR, and sets up\
    \ the connection request using the MAR bandwidth\n   allocation rules.  The LER\
    \ selects a first-choice path and determines\n   if bandwidth can be allocated\
    \ on the path based on the MAR bandwidth\n   allocation rules given in Section\
    \ 4.  If the first choice path has\n   insufficient bandwidth, the LER may then\
    \ try alternate paths, and\n   again applies the MAR bandwidth allocation rules\
    \ now described.\n   MAR bandwidth allocation is done on a per-CT basis, in which\n\
    \   aggregated CT bandwidth is managed to meet the overall bandwidth\n   requirements\
    \ of CT service needs.  Individual flows/LSPs are\n   allocated bandwidth in the\
    \ corresponding CT according to CT bandwidth\n   availability.  A fundamental\
    \ principle applied in MAR bandwidth\n   allocation methods is the use of bandwidth\
    \ reservation techniques.\n   Bandwidth reservation gives preference to the preferred\
    \ traffic by\n   allowing it to seize idle bandwidth on a link more easily than\
    \ the\n   non-preferred traffic.  Burke [BUR] first analyzed bandwidth\n   reservation\
    \ behavior from the solution of the birth-death equations\n   for the bandwidth\
    \ reservation model.  Burke's model showed the\n   relative lost-traffic level\
    \ for preferred traffic, which is not\n   subject to bandwidth reservation restrictions,\
    \ as compared to non-\n   preferred traffic, which is subject to the restrictions.\
    \  Bandwidth\n   reservation protection is robust to traffic variations and provides\n\
    \   significant dynamic protection of particular streams of traffic.  It\n   is\
    \ widely used in large-scale network applications [ASH1, MUM, AKI,\n   KRU, NAK].\n\
    \   Bandwidth reservation is used in MAR bandwidth allocation to control\n   sharing\
    \ of link bandwidth across different CTs.  On a given link, a\n   small amount\
    \ of bandwidth (RBW_THRES) is reserved (perhaps 1% of the\n   total link bandwidth),\
    \ and the reservation bandwidth can be accessed\n   when a given CT has reserved\
    \ bandwidth-in-progress (RESERVED_BW)\n   below its allocated bandwidth (BC).\
    \  That is, if the available link\n   bandwidth (unreserved idle link bandwidth\
    \ UNRESERVED_BW) exceeds\n   RBW_THRES, then any CT is free to access the available\
    \ bandwidth on\n   the link.  However, if UNRESERVED_BW is less than RBW_THRES,\
    \ then the\n   CT can utilize the available bandwidth only if its current bandwidth\n\
    \   usage is below the allocated amount (BC).  In this way, bandwidth can\n  \
    \ be fully shared among CTs if available, but it is protected by\n   bandwidth\
    \ reservation if below the reservation level.\n   Through the bandwidth reservation\
    \ mechanism, MAR bandwidth allocation\n   also gives preference to high-priority\
    \ CTs, in comparison to normal-\n   priority and best-effort priority CTs.\n \
    \  Hence, bandwidth allocated to each CT is protected by bandwidth\n   reservation\
    \ methods, as needed, but otherwise shared.  Each LER\n   monitors CT bandwidth\
    \ use on each CT, and determines if connection\n   requests can be allocated to\
    \ the CT bandwidth.  For example, for a\n   bandwidth request of DBW on a given\
    \ flow/LSP, the LER determines the\n   CT priority (high, normal, or best-effort),\
    \ CT bandwidth-in-use, and\n   CT bandwidth allocation thresholds, and uses these\
    \ parameters to\n   determine the allowed load state threshold to which capacity\
    \ can be\n   allocated.  In allocating bandwidth DBW to a CT on given LSP (for\n\
    \   example, A-B-E), each link in the path is checked for available\n   bandwidth\
    \ in comparison to the allowed load state.  If bandwidth is\n   unavailable on\
    \ any link in path A-B-E, another LSP could be tried,\n   such as A-C-D-E.  Hence,\
    \ determination of the link load state is\n   necessary for MAR bandwidth allocation,\
    \ and two link load states are\n   distinguished: available (non-reserved) bandwidth\
    \ (ABW_STATE), and\n   reserved-bandwidth (RBW_STATE).  Management of CT capacity\
    \ uses the\n   link state and the allowed load state threshold to determine if\
    \ a\n   bandwidth allocation request can be accepted on a given CT.\n"

  - "A.2.  Analysis of MAR Performance\n   In this Appendix, modeling analysis is\
    \ presented in which MAR\n   bandwidth allocation is shown to provide good network\
    \ performance,\n   relative to full sharing models, under normal and abnormal\
    \ operating\n   conditions.  A large-scale Diffserv-aware MPLS traffic engineering\n\
    \   simulation model is used, in which several CTs with different\n   priority\
    \ classes share the pool of bandwidth on a multiservice,\n   integrated voice/data\
    \ network.  MAR methods have also been analyzed\n   in practice for networks that\
    \ use time division multiplexing (i.e.,\n   TDM-based networks) [ASH1], and in\
    \ modeling studies for IP-based\n   networks [ASH2, ASH3, E.360].\n   All Bandwidth\
    \ Constraints Models should meet these objectives:\n   1. applies equally when\
    \ preemption is either enabled or disabled\n      (when preemption is disabled,\
    \ the model still works 'reasonably'\n      well),\n   2. bandwidth efficiency,\
    \ i.e., good bandwidth sharing among CTs under\n      both normal and overload\
    \ conditions,\n   3. bandwidth isolation, i.e., a CT cannot hog the bandwidth\
    \ of\n      another CT under overload conditions,\n   4. protection against QoS\
    \ degradation, at least of the high-priority\n      CTs (e.g., high-priority voice,\
    \ high-priority data, etc.), and\n   5. reasonably simple, i.e., does not require\
    \ additional IGP\n      extensions and minimizes signaling load processing requirements.\n\
    \   The use of any given Bandwidth Constraints Model has significant\n   impacts\
    \ on the performance of a network, as explained later.\n   Therefore, the criteria\
    \ used to select a model need to enable us to\n   evaluate how a particular model\
    \ delivers its performance, relative to\n   other models.  Lai [LAI, DSTE-PERF]\
    \ has analyzed the MAM and RDM\n   Models and provided valuable insights into\
    \ the relative performance\n   of these models under various network conditions.\n\
    \   In environments where preemption is not used, MAM is attractive\n   because\
    \ a) it is good at achieving isolation, and b) it achieves\n   reasonable bandwidth\
    \ efficiency with some QoS degradation of lower\n   classes.  When preemption\
    \ is used, RDM is attractive because it can\n   achieve bandwidth efficiency under\
    \ normal load.  However, RDM cannot\n   provide service isolation under high load\
    \ or when preemption is not\n   used.\n   Our performance analysis of MAR bandwidth\
    \ allocation methods is based\n   on a full-scale, 135-node simulation model of\
    \ a national network,\n   combined with a multiservice traffic demand model to\
    \ study various\n   scenarios and tradeoffs [ASH3, E.360].  Three levels of traffic\n\
    \   priority -- high, normal, and best effort -- are given across 5 CTs:\n   normal\
    \ priority voice, high priority voice, normal priority data,\n   high priority\
    \ data, and best effort data.\n   The performance analyses for overloads and failures\
    \ include a) the\n   MAR Bandwidth Constraints Model, as specified in Section\
    \ 4, b) the\n   MAM Bandwidth Constraints Model, and c) the No-DSTE Bandwidth\n\
    \   Constraints Model.\n   The allocated bandwidth constraints for MAR are described\
    \ in Section\n   5 as:\n   Normal priority CTs:      BCck = PROPORTIONAL_BWk,\n\
    \   High priority CTs:        BCck = FACTOR X PROPORTIONAL_BWk\n   Best-effort\
    \ priority CTs: BCck = 0\n   In the MAM Bandwidth Constraints Model, the bandwidth\
    \ constraints for\n   each CT are set to a multiple of the proportional bandwidth\n\
    \   allocation:\n   Normal priority CTs:      BCck = FACTOR1 X PROPORTIONAL_BWk,\n\
    \   High priority CTs:        BCck = FACTOR2 X PROPORTIONAL_BWk\n   Best-effort\
    \ priority CTs: BCck = 0\n   Simulations show that for MAM, the sum (BCc) should\
    \ exceed\n   MAX_RESERVABLE_BWk for better efficiency, as follows:\n   1. The\
    \ normal priority CTs and the BCc values need to be over-\n      allocated to\
    \ get reasonable performance.  It was found that over-\n      allocating by 100%\
    \ (i.e., setting FACTOR1 = 2), gave reasonable\n      performance.\n   2. The\
    \ high priority CTs can be over-allocated by a larger multiple\n      FACTOR2\
    \ in MAM and this gives better performance.\n   The rather large amount of over-allocation\
    \ improves efficiency, but\n   somewhat defeats the 'bandwidth protection/isolation'\
    \ needed with a\n   BC Model, because one CT can now invade the bandwidth allocated\
    \ to\n   another CT.  Each CT is restricted to its allocated bandwidth\n   constraint\
    \ BCck, which is the maximum level of bandwidth allocated to\n   each CT on each\
    \ link, as in normal operation of MAM.\n   In the No-DSTE Bandwidth Constraints\
    \ Model, no reservation or\n   protection of CT bandwidth is applied, and bandwidth\
    \ allocation\n   requests are admitted if bandwidth is available.  Furthermore,\
    \ no\n   queuing priority is applied to any of the CTs in the No-DSTE\n   Bandwidth\
    \ Constraints Model.\n   Table 2 gives performance results for a six-times overload\
    \ on a\n   single network node at Oakbrook, Illinois.  The numbers given in the\n\
    \   table are the total network percent lost (i.e., blocked) or delayed\n   traffic.\

    \   Again, we can see the performance is always better when MAR bandwidth\n  \
    \ allocation and reservation is used.\n   Lai's results [LAI, DSTE-PERF] show\
    \ the trade-off between bandwidth\n   sharing and service protection/isolation,\
    \ using an analytic model of\n   a single link.  He shows that RDM has a higher\
    \ degree of sharing than\n   MAM.  Furthermore, for a single link, the overall\
    \ loss probability is\n   the smallest under full sharing and largest under MAM,\
    \ with RDM being\n   intermediate.  Hence, on a single link, Lai shows that the\
    \ full\n   sharing model yields the highest link efficiency, while MAM yields\n\
    \   the lowest; and that full sharing has the poorest service protection\n   capability.\n\
    \   The results of the present study show that, when considering a\n   network\
    \ context in which there are many links and multiple-link\n   routing paths are\
    \ used, full sharing does not necessarily lead to\n   maximum, network-wide bandwidth\
    \ efficiency.  In fact, the results in\n   Table 4 show that the No-DSTE Model\
    \ not only degrades total network\n   throughput, but also degrades the performance\
    \ of every CT that should\n   be protected.  Allowing more bandwidth sharing may\
    \ improve\n   performance up to a point, but it can severely degrade performance\
    \ if\n   care is not taken to protect allocated bandwidth under congestion.\n\
    \   Both Lai's study and this study show that increasing the degree of\n   bandwidth\
    \ sharing among the different CTs leads to a tighter coupling\n   between CTs.\
    \  Under normal loading conditions, there is adequate\n   capacity for each CT,\
    \ which minimizes the effect of such coupling.\n   Under overload conditions,\
    \ when there is a scarcity of capacity, such\n   coupling can cause severe degradation\
    \ of service, especially for the\n   lower priority CTs.\n   Thus, the objective\
    \ of maximizing efficient bandwidth usage, as\n   stated in Bandwidth Constraints\
    \ Model objectives, needs to be\n   exercised with care.  Due consideration also\
    \ needs to be given to\n   achieving bandwidth isolation under overload, in order\
    \ to minimize\n   the effect of interactions among the different CTs.  The proper\n\
    \   tradeoff of bandwidth sharing and bandwidth isolation needs to be\n   achieved\
    \ in the selection of a Bandwidth Constraints Model.\n   Bandwidth reservation\
    \ supports greater efficiency in bandwidth\n   sharing, while still providing\
    \ bandwidth isolation and protection\n   against QoS degradation.\n   In summary,\
    \ the proposed MAR Bandwidth Constraints Model includes the\n   following: a)\
    \ allocation of bandwidth to individual CTs, b)\n   protection of allocated bandwidth\
    \ by bandwidth reservation methods,\n   as needed, but otherwise full sharing\
    \ of bandwidth, c)\n   differentiation between high-priority, normal-priority,\
    \ and best-\n   effort priority services, and d) provision of admission control\
    \ to\n   reject connection requests, when needed, in order to meet performance\n\
    \   objectives.\n   In the modeling results, the MAR Bandwidth Constraints Model\
    \ compares\n   favorably with methods that do not use bandwidth reservation. \
    \ In\n   particular, some of the conclusions from the modeling are as follows:\n\
    \   o MAR bandwidth allocation is effective in improving performance over\n  \
    \   methods that lack bandwidth reservation; this allows more bandwidth\n    \
    \ sharing under congestion.\n   o MAR achieves service differentiation for high-priority,\
    \ normal-\n     priority, and best-effort priority services.\n   o Bandwidth reservation\
    \ supports greater efficiency in bandwidth\n     sharing while still providing\
    \ bandwidth isolation and protection\n     against QoS degradation, and is critical\
    \ to stable and efficient\n     network performance.\n"

    \ predictions are used on Head-ends, the optional Bandwidth\n   Constraints sub-TLV\
    \ and the optional Maximum Reservable Bandwidth\n   sub-TLV MAY be advertised\
    \ in the IGP.  This can be used by Head-ends\n   to predict how an LSP affects\
    \ unreserved bandwidth values.  Such\n   predictions can be made with MAR by using\
    \ the unreserved bandwidth\n   values advertised by the IGP, as discussed in Sections\
    \ 2 and 4:\n   UNRESERVED_BWck = MAX_RESERVABLE_BWk - UNRESERVED_BWk -\n     \
    \                delta0/1(CTck) * RBW-THRESk\n   where\n   delta0/1(CTck) = 0\
    \ if RESERVED_BWck < BCck\n   delta0/1(CTck) = 1 if RESERVED_BWck >= BCck\n  \
    \ Furthermore, the following estimate can be made for RBW_THRESk:\n   RBW_THRESk\
    \ = RBW_% * MAX_RESERVABLE_BWk,\n   where RBW_% is a locally configured variable,\
    \ which could take on\n   different values for different link speeds.  This information\
    \ could\n   be used in conjunction with the BC sub-TLV, MAX_RESERVABLE_BW sub-\n\
    \   TLV, and UNRESERVED_BW sub-TLV to make predictions of available\n   bandwidth\
    \ on each link for each CT.  Because admission control\n   algorithms are left\
    \ for vendor differentiation, predictions can only\n   be performed effectively\
    \ when the Head-end LSR predictions are based\n   on the same (or a very close)\
    \ admission control algorithm used by\n   other LSRs.\n   LSPs may occasionally\
    \ be rejected when head-ends are establishing\n   LSPs through a common link.\
    \  As an example, consider some link L, and\n   two head-ends H1 and H2.  If only\
    \ H1 or only H2 is establishing LSPs\n   through L, then the prediction is accurate.\
    \  But if both H1 and H2\n   are establishing LSPs through L at the same time,\
    \ the prediction\n   would not work perfectly.  In other words, the CAC will occasionally\n\
    \   run into a rejected LSP on a link with such 'race' conditions.  Also,\n  \
    \ as mentioned in Appendix A, such a prediction is optional and outside\n   the\
    \ scope of the document.\n"
