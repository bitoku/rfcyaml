- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Some implementations of IP Security (IPsec) may want to use a\n\
    \   pseudo-random function derived from the Advanced Encryption Standard\n   (AES).\
    \  This document describes such an algorithm, called AES-XCBC-\n   PRF-128.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [AES-XCBC-MAC] describes a method to use the Advanced Encryption\n\
    \   Standard (AES) as a message authentication code (MAC) whose output is\n  \
    \ 96 bits long.  While 96 bits is considered appropriate for a MAC, it\n   is\
    \ too short to be useful as a long-lived pseudo-random (PRF) in\n   either IKE\
    \ version 1 or version 2.  Both versions of IKE use the PRF\n   to create keys\
    \ in a fashion that is dependent on the length of the\n   output of the PRF. \
    \ Using a PRF that has 96 bits of output creates\n   keys that are easier to attack\
    \ with brute force than a PRF that uses\n   128 bits of output.\n   Fortunately,\
    \ there is a very simple method to use much of [AES-XCBC-\n   MAC] as a PRF whose\
    \ output is 128 bits: omit the step that truncates\n   the 128-bit value to 96\
    \ bits.\n"
- title: 2.  The AES-XCBC-PRF-128 Algorithm
  contents:
  - "2.  The AES-XCBC-PRF-128 Algorithm\n   The AES-XCBC-PRF-128 algorithm is identical\
    \ to [AES-XCBC-MAC] except\n   that the truncation step in section 4.3 of [AES-XCBC-MAC]\
    \ is *not*\n   performed.  That is, there is no processing after section 4.2 of\n\
    \   [AES-XCBC-MAC].\n   The test vectors in section 4.6 can be used for AES-XCBC-PRF-128,\
    \ but\n   only those listed as \"AES-XCBC-MAC\", not \"AES-XCBC-MAC-96\".\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The security provided by AES-XCBC-MAC-PRF is\
    \ based upon the strength\n   of AES.  At the time of this writing, there are\
    \ no known practical\n   cryptographic attacks against AES or AES-XCBC-MAC-PRF.\n\
    \   As is true with any cryptographic algorithm, part of its strength\n   lies\
    \ in the security of the key management mechanism, the strength of\n   the associated\
    \ secret key, and upon the correctness of the\n   implementations in all of the\
    \ participating systems.  [AES-XCBC-MAC]\n   contains test vectors to assist in\
    \ verifying the correctness of the\n   AES-XCBC-MAC-PRF code.  The test vectors\
    \ all show the full MAC value\n   before it is truncated to 96 bits.  The PRF\
    \ makes use of the full MAC\n   value, not the truncated one.\n"
