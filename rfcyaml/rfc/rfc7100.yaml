  - "Abstract\n   This document updates RFC 2026 to no longer use STD 1 as a summary\
    \ of\n   \"Internet Official Protocol Standards\".  It obsoletes RFC 5000 and\n\
    \   requests the IESG to move RFC 5000 (and therefore STD 1) to Historic\n   status.\n"

- title: 1.  Retiring STD 1
  contents:
  - "1.  Retiring STD 1\n   RFC 2026 [RFC2026] and its predecessors call for the publication\
    \ of\n   an RFC describing the status of IETF protocols:\n      The RFC Editor\
    \ shall publish periodically an \"Internet Official\n      Protocol Standards\"\
    \ RFC [1], summarizing the status of all\n      Internet protocol and service\
    \ specifications.\n   The \"Internet Official Protocol Standards\" document, now\
    \ as RFC 5000\n   [RFC5000], has always been listed in the Internet Standard series\
    \ as\n   STD 1.  However, the document has not been kept up to date in recent\n\
    \   years, and it has fallen out of use in favor of the online list\n   produced\
    \ by the RFC Editor [STDS-TRK].  The IETF no longer sees the\n   need for the\
    \ document to be maintained.  Therefore, this document\n   updates RFC 2026 [RFC2026],\
    \ effectively removing the above-mentioned\n   paragraph from Section 6.1.3, along\
    \ with the paragraph from\n   Section 2.1 that states:\n      The status of Internet\
    \ protocol and service specifications is\n      summarized periodically in an\
    \ RFC entitled \"Internet Official\n      Protocol Standards\" [1].  This RFC\
    \ shows the level of maturity and\n      other helpful information for each Internet\
    \ protocol or service\n      specification (see section 3).\n   and the paragraph\
    \ from Section 3.3 that states:\n      The \"Official Protocol Standards\" RFC\
    \ (STD1) lists a general\n      requirement level for each TS, using the nomenclature\
    \ defined in\n      this section.  This RFC is updated periodically.  In many\
    \ cases,\n      more detailed descriptions of the requirement levels of particular\n\
    \      protocols and of individual features of the protocols will be\n      found\
    \ in appropriate ASs.\n   Additionally, this document obsoletes RFC 5000 [RFC5000],\
    \ the current\n   incarnation of that document, and requests that the IESG move\
    \ that\n   document (and therefore STD 1) to Historic status.\n   Finally, RFC\
    \ 2026 [RFC2026] Section 6.1.3 also calls for the\n   publication of an \"official\
    \ summary of standards actions completed\n   and pending\" in the Internet Society's\
    \ newsletter.  This has also not\n   been done in recent years, and the \"publication\
    \ of record\" for\n   standards actions has for some time been the minutes of\
    \ the IESG\n   [IESG-MINUTES].  Therefore, that paragraph is also effectively\n\
    \   removed from Section 6.1.3.\n"
