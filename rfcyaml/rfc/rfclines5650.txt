The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community for the purpose of managing VDSL2, ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2  lines.
The MIB module described in RFC 2662
[RFC2662] describes objects used for managing Asymmetric Bit Rate DSL (ADSL) interfaces per [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].
These object descriptions are based upon the specifications for the ADSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) as defined in American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
T1E1.413/1995 [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication Union (ITU T)
G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2].
The MIB module described in RFC 4706
[RFC4706] is a wider management model that includes, in addition to ADSL technology, the ADSL2 and ADSL2  technologies per G.992.3, G.992.4, and G.992.5 ([G.992.3], [G.992.4], and [G.992.5], respectively).
This document does not obsolete RFC 2662
[RFC4706], but rather provides a more comprehensive management model that addresses the VDSL2 technology per G.993.2 ([G.993.2]) as well as ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2
This document does not obsolete RFC 2662
RFC 2662 is relevant only for managing modems that do not support any DSL technology other than ADSL (e.g., G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2]) especially if the modems were produced prior to approval of ITU T G.997.1 standard revision 3 [G.997.1].
RFC 4706 is more appropriate for managing modems that support ADSL2 technology variants (with or without being able to support the legacy ADSL).
This document supports all ADSL, ADSL2, and VDSL2 standards, but it assumes a more sophisticated management model, which older modems (even ADSL2 ones) may not be able to support.
The selection of the appropriate MIB module for any DSL modem is based on the ifType value it reports, as explained in the next section.
The management framework for VDSL2 lines [TR 129] specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has been taken into consideration.
That framework is based on the ITU T G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] and its amendment 1 [G.997.1 Am1].
Note that the management model, according to this document, does not allow managing VDSL technology per G.993.1 [G.993.1].
VDSL lines MUST be managed by RFC 3728 [RFC3728].
The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission, as discussed in the MIB 2 Integration (RFC 2863 [RFC2863]) section of this document.
This section outlines the relationship of this MIB module with other MIB modules described in RFCs.
Specifically, IF MIB as defined in RFC 2863
[RFC2863] and ENTITY MIB as defined in RFC 4133 [RFC4133] are discussed.
Relationship with IF MIB (RFC 2863)
The VDSL2 Line MIB specifies the detailed objects of a data interface.
As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [RFC2863].
The IANA has assigned the following ifTypes, which may be applicable for VDSL2 lines as well as for ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2
ADSL lines that are identified with ifType adsl(94) MUST be managed with the MIB specified by RFC 2662.
lines identified with ifType adsl2plus(238) MUST be managed with the MIB specified by RFC 4706 [RFC4706].
VDSL2, ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2
lines identified with ifType vdsl2(251) MUST be managed with the MIB specified by this document.
In any case, the SNMP agent may use either ifType interleave(124) or fast(125) for each channel, e.g., depending on whether or not it is capable of using an interleaver on that channel.
It may use the ifType channel (70) when all channels are capable of using an interleaver (e.g., for ADSL2 xTUs).
Note that the ifFixedLengthGroup from RFC 2863
[RFC2863] MUST be supported and that the ifRcvAddressGroup does not apply to this MIB module.
The MIB branch identified by ifType contains tables appropriate for the interface types described above.
Most such tables extend the ifEntry table, and are indexed by ifIndex.
For interfaces in systems implementing this MIB module, those table entries indexed by ifIndex MUST be persistent.
The following objects are part of the mandatory ifGeneralInformationGroup in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863], and are not duplicated in the VDSL2 Line MIB.
This object MUST have an octet string with zero length.
Use of ifTable Objects 2.1.1.3.
Usage of ifStackTable Use of the ifStackTable
to associate the entries for physical, fast, interleaved channels, and higher layers (e.g., ATM) is shown below.
Use of the ifStackTable is necessary because configuration information is stored in profile tables associated with the physical  layer ifEntry only.
The channels' ifEntrys need the ifStackTable to find their associated physical layer entry and thus their configuration parameters.
The following example shows the ifStackTable entries for an xDSL line with a single channel that uses an ATM data path.
ifStackTable Entries for ATM Path over a Single xDSL Channel 2.1.2.
Relationship with the ENTITY MIB (RFC 4133)
Implementation of the Entity MIB [RFC4133] is optional.
It in no way alters the information required in the VDSL2 Line MIB, nor does it alter the relationship with IF MIB.
The Entity MIB introduces a standardized way of presenting the components of complex systems, such as a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM), that may contain multiple racks, shelves, line cards, and/or ports.
The Entity MIB's main goal is to present these system components, their containment relationship, and mapping information with other MIBs such as the Interface MIB and the VDSL2 Line MIB.
The Entity MIB is capable of supporting the local DSL termination unit.
Thus, assuming the SNMP agent is in the DSLAM, the Entity MIB should include entities for the xTU C in the entPhysicalTable.
The MIB's entAliasMappingTable would contain mapping information identifying the 'ifIndex' object associated with each xTU C.
In case the SNMP agent is actually in the Customer Premise Equipment (CPE), the Entity MIB should include entities for the xTU R in the entPhysicalTable.
In this case, the MIB's entAliasMappingTable would contain mapping information identifying the 'ifIndex' object associated with each xTU R. Also associating the relationship between the ifTable and Entity MIB, the entPhysicalTable contains an 'entPhysicalName' object, which approximates the semantics of the 'ifName' object from the Interface MIB.
A new ifType value (251) for Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Loop Version 2 has been allocated for the VDSL2 LINE MIB module, to distinguish between ADSL lines that are managed with the RFC 2662 management model, ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2  lines that are managed with the RFC 4706 [RFC4706] management model, and VDSL2/
ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2  lines that are managed with the model defined in this document.
Also, the VDSL2 LINE MIB module has been assigned a single object identifier (251) for its MODULE IDENTITY.
The IANA has allocated this object identifier in the transmission subtree.
As performed in the past for the ADSL2 LINE MIB module, the IANA has ensured that the allocated ifType value is the same as the allocated branch number in the transmission subtree.

line consists of two units: atuc or vtuc (a central office termination unit) and atur or vtur (a remote termination unit).
There are up to 4 channels (maximum number of channels depends on the specific DSL technology), each carrying an independent information flow, as shown in the figure below.
#4 carried over the line Figure 3: General Topology for a VDSL2/ADSL/
Counters, Interval Buckets, and Thresholds 2.7.1.
Counters Managed There are various types of counters specified in this MIB.
Each counter refers either to the whole VDSL2/ADSL/
ADSL2  line, to one of the xTU entities, or to one of the bearer channels.
On the whole line level For full initializations, failed full initializations, short initializations, and for failed short initializations, there are event counters, current 15 minute and 0 to 96 15 minute history bucket(s) of "interval counters", as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1 day interval counter(s).
Each current 15 minute "failed" event bucket has an associated threshold notification.
On the xTU level For the LOS seconds, ES, SES, FEC seconds, and UAS, there are event counters, current 15 minute and 0 to 96 15 minute history bucket(s) of "interval counters", as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1 day interval counter(s).
Each current 15 minute event bucket has an associated threshold notification.
On the bearer channel level For the coding violations (CRC anomalies) and corrected blocks (i.e., FEC events), there are event counters, current 15 minute and 0 to 96 15 minute history bucket(s) of "interval counters", as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1 day interval counter(s).
Each current 15 minute event bucket has an associated threshold notification.
Although it is possible to support up to 96 15 minute history buckets of "interval counters", systems implementing this MIB module SHOULD practically support at least 16 buckets, as specified in ITU T G.997.1, paragraph #7.2.7.9.
Similarly, it is possible to support up to 30 previous 1 day "interval counters", but systems implementing this MIB module SHOULD support at least 1 previous day bucket.
There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship between the start of a 15 minute interval and any wall clock; however, some implementations may align the 15 minute intervals with quarter hours.
Likewise, an implementation may choose to align 1 day intervals with the start of a day.
Counters are not reset when an xTU is reinitialized, only when the agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside the scope of this MIB module).
Validity As in RFC 3593
[RFC2662], in case the data for an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent MUST report the interval as invalid.
If the current 15 minute event bucket is determined to be invalid, the element management system SHOULD ignore its content and the agent MUST NOT generate notifications based upon the value of the event bucket.
A valid 15 minute event bucket SHOULD usually count the events for exactly 15 minutes.
Similarly, a valid 1 day event bucket SHOULD usually count the events for exactly 24 hours.
However, the following scenarios are exceptional: 1)
For implementations that align the 15 minute intervals with quarter hours and the 1 day intervals with start of a day, the management system may still start the PM process not aligned with the wall clock.
Such a management system may wish to retrieve even partial information for the first event buckets, rather than declaring them all as invalid.
For an event bucket that suffered relatively short outages, the management system may wish to retrieve the available PM outcomes, rather than declaring the whole event bucket as invalid.
This is more important for 1 day event buckets.
An event bucket may be shorter or longer than the formal duration if a clock adjustment was performed during the interval.
This MIB module allows supporting the exceptional scenarios described above by reporting the actual Monitoring Time of a monitoring interval.
This parameter is relevant only for Valid intervals, but is useful for these exceptional scenarios: a)
The management system MAY still declare a partial PM interval as Valid and report the actual number of seconds the interval lasted.
If the interval was shortened or extended due to clock corrections, the management system SHOULD report the actual number of seconds the interval lasted, in addition to reporting that the interval is Valid.
As a managed node can handle a large number of xTUs, (e.g., hundreds or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on every xTU may become burdensome.
Moreover, most lines are provisioned identically with the same set of parameters.
To simplify the provisioning process, this MIB module makes use of profiles and templates.
A configuration profile is a set of parameters that can be shared by multiple entities.
There is a configuration profile to address line  level provisioning and another type of profile that addresses channel level provisioning parameters.
A configuration template is actually a profile of profiles.
That is, a template is comprised of one line configuration profile and one or more channel configuration profiles.
A template provides the complete configuration of a line.
The same configuration can be shared by multiple lines.
In a similar manner to the configuration profiles and templates, this MIB module makes use of templates and profiles for specifying the alarm thresholds associated with performance parameters.
This allows provisioning multiple lines with the same criteria for generating threshold crossing notifications.
The following paragraphs describe templates and profiles used in this MIB module.
Line Configuration Profiles Line configuration profiles contain line level parameters for configuring VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2  lines.
They are defined in the xdsl2LineConfProfTable.
The line configuration includes settings such as the specific VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2  modes to enable on the respective line, power spectrum parameters, rate adaptation criteria, and SNR margin related parameters.
A subset of the line configuration parameters depends upon the specific xDSL Mode allowed (i.e., does the profile allow VDSL2, ADSL, ADSL2 and/or ADSL2 ?)
as well as what annex/annexes of the standard are allowed.
This is the reason a line profile MUST include one or more mode specific extensions.
Channel Configuration Profiles Channel configuration profiles contain parameters for configuring bearer channels over the VDSL2/ ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2  lines.
They are sometimes considered as the service layer configuration of the VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2  lines.
They are defined in the xdsl2ChConfProfTable.
The channel configuration includes issues such as the desired minimum and maximum rate on each traffic flow direction and impulse noise protection parameters.
Line Configuration Templates Line configuration templates allow combining line configuration profiles and channel configuration profiles into a comprehensive configuration of the VDSL2/ADSL/ ADSL2 and ADSL2  line.
They are defined in the xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable.
The line configuration template includes one index of a line configuration profile and one to four indices of channel configuration profiles.
The template also addresses the issue of distributing the excess available data rate on each traffic flow direction (i.e., the data rate left after each channel is allocated a data rate to satisfy its minimum requested data rate) among the various channels.
Alarm Configuration Profiles and Templates  Line Alarm Configuration Profiles Line level Alarm configuration profiles contain the threshold values for Performance Monitoring (PM) parameters, counted either on the whole line level or on an xTU level.
Thresholds are required only for failures and anomalies.
For example, there are thresholds for failed initializations and LOS seconds, but not for the aggregate number of full initializations.
These profiles are defined in the xdsl2LineAlarmConfProfileTable.
Channel Alarm Configuration Profiles Channel level Alarm configuration profiles contain the threshold values for PM parameters counted on a bearer channel level.
Thresholds are defined for two types of anomalies: corrected blocks and coding violations.
These profiles are defined in the xdsl2ChAlarmConfProfileTable.
Line Alarm Configuration Templates Line Alarm configuration templates allow combining line level alarm configuration profiles and channel level alarm configuration profiles into a comprehensive configuration of the PM thresholds for the VDSL2/ ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2  line.
They are defined in the xdsl2LineAlarmConfTemplateTable.
The line alarm configuration template includes one index of a line level alarm configuration profile and one to four indices of channel level alarm configuration profiles.
Managing Profiles and Templates The index value for each profile and template is a locally unique, administratively assigned name having the textual convention 'SnmpAdminString' (RFC 3411 [RFC3411]).
One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single configuration template (e.g., xdsl2LConfTempTemplateName   'silver') by setting its xdsl2LineConfTemplate object to the value of this template.
One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single Alarm configuration template (e.g., xdsl2LAlarmConfTempTemplateName   'silver') by setting its xdsl2LineAlarmConfTemplate object to the value of this template.
Before a template can be deleted or taken out of service, it MUST be first unreferenced from all associated lines.
Implementations MAY also reject template modification while it is associated with any line.
Before a profile can be deleted or taken out of service, it MUST be first unreferenced from all associated templates.
Implementations MAY also reject profile modification while it is referenced by any template.
Implementations MUST provide a default profile whose name is 'DEFVAL' for each profile and template type.
The values of the associated parameters will be vendor specific unless otherwise indicated in this document.
Before a line's templates have been set, these templates will be automatically used by setting xdsl2LineConfTemplate and xdsl2LineAlarmConfTemplate to 'DEFVAL' where appropriate.
This default profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the context of profiles and templates defined in this MIB module.
Profiles and templates are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically using the profile name and profile row status in each of the profile tables.
If the implementation allows modifying a profile or template while it is associated with a line, then such changes MUST take effect immediately.
These changes MAY result in a restart (hard reset or soft restart) of the units on the line.
Network Elements MAY optionally implement a fallback line configuration template (see xdsl2LineConfFallbackTemplate).
The fallback template will be tried if the xDSL2 line fails to operate using the primary template.
If the xDSL2 line fails to operate using the fallback template, then the primary template should be retried.
The xTU C SHOULD continue to alternate between the primary and fallback templates until one of them succeeds.
The number of bearer channels is configured by setting the template objects xdsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile, xdsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile, xdsl2LConfTempChan3ConfProfile, and xdsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile and then assigning that template to a DSL line using the xdsl2LineConfTemplate object.
When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes, the SNMP agent will automatically create or destroy rows in channel related tables associated with that line.
For example, when a DSL line is operating with one bearer channel, there will be zero rows in channel related tables for channels two, three, and four.
The SNMP agent MUST create and destroy channel related rows as follows:
When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes to a higher number, the SNMP agent will automatically create rows in the xdsl2ChannelStatusTable and xdsl2PMChCurrTable tables for that line.
When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes to a lower number, the SNMP agent will automatically destroy rows in the xdsl2ChannelStatusTable, xdsl2PMChCurrTable,xdsl2PMChHist15MinTable, and xdsl2PMChHist1DTable tables for that line.
The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/WarmStart (per [RFC3418]), which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and linkUp/ linkDown (per [RFC2863]), which are per interface (i.e., VDSL2/ADSL/ ADSL2 or ADSL2  line) is required.
A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any of ES, SES, CRC anomaly, LOS, LOF, or UAS events occur.
The corresponding linkUp notification MAY be sent when all link failure conditions are cleared.
The notifications defined in this MIB module are for status change (e.g., initialization failure) and for the threshold crossings associated with the following events: full initialization failures, short initialization failures, ES, SES, LOS seconds, UAS, FEC seconds, FEC events, and CRC anomalies.
Each threshold has its own enable/threshold value.
When that value is 0, the notification is disabled.
The xdsl2LineStatusXtur and xdsl2LineStatusXtuc are bitmasks representing all outstanding error conditions associated with the xTU R and xTU C (respectively).
that since the xTU R status is obtained via the EOC, this information may be unavailable in case the xTU R is unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.
Therefore, not all conditions may always be included in its current status.
Notifications corresponding to the bit fields in those two status objects are defined.
Note that there are other status parameters that refer to the xTU R (e.g., downstream line attenuation).
Those parameters also depend on the availability of EOC between the central office xTU and the remote xTU.
A threshold notification occurs whenever the corresponding current 15 minute interval error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds the threshold value.
Only one notification SHOULD be sent per interval per interface.
Since the current 15 minute counter is reset to 0 every 15 minutes, and if the condition persists, the notification may recur as often as every 15 minutes.
For example, to get a notification whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once every 15 minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.
The agent will generate a notification when the event originally occurs.
Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [RFC2863]).
At the beginning of the next 15  minute interval, the counter is reset.
When the first second goes by and the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, which equals the threshold, and the notification will be sent again.

For a band in the upstream direction, transmission is from the remote end (xTU R) towards the central office end (xTU C).
For a band in the downstream direction, transmission is from the xTU C towards the xTU R. For ADSL, ADSL2 and ADSL2 , which use a single band in the upstream direction and a single band in the downstream direction, the only relevant values are upstream(1) and downstream(2).
For VDSL2, which uses multiple bands in each transmission direction, a band in the upstream direction is indicated by any of us0(3), us1(5), us2(7), us3(9), or us4(11), and a band in the downstream direction is indicated by any of ds1(4), ds2(6), ds3(8), or ds4(10).
For VDSL2, the values upstream(1) and downstream(2) may be used when there is a need to refer to the whole upstream or downstream traffic (e.g., report the average signal to noise ratio on any transmission direction).
(refers to the single upstream band for   ADSL/
ADSL2/ADSL2  or to the whole   upstream traffic for VDSL2).
(refers to the single downstream band   for ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2  or to the whole   downstream traffic for VDSL2).

This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community for the purpose of managing VDSL2, ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2  lines.
The MIB module described in RFC 2662
[RFC2662] defines objects used for managing Asymmetric Bit Rate DSL (ADSL) interfaces per [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].
These object descriptions are based upon the specifications for the ADSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) as defined in American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
T1E1.413 [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication Union (ITU T)
G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2].
The MIB module described in RFC 4706 [RFC4706] defines objects used for managing ADSL2 interfaces per [G.992.3] and [G.992.4], and ADSL2  interfaces per [G.992.5].
That MIB is also capable of managing ADSL interfaces per [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].
This document does not obsolete RFC 2662
[RFC4706], but rather provides a more comprehensive management model that manages VDSL2 interfaces per G.993.2
[G.993.2] as well as ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2
technologies per T1E1.413, G.992.1, G.992.2, G.992.3, G.992.4, and G.992.5 ([T1E1.413], [G.992.1], [G.992.2], [G.992.3], [G.992.4], and [G.992.5], respectively).
Additionally, the management framework for VDSL2 lines specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has been taken into consideration [TR 129].
That framework is based on the ITU T G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] and its amendment 1 [G.997.1 Am1].
The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission, as discussed in the MIB 2 Integration (RFC 2863 [RFC2863]) section of this document.

"The table xdsl2LineTable contains configuration, command and status parameters of the VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2  line.
Several objects in this table MUST be maintained in a persistent manner."
"The index of this table is an interface index where the interface has an ifType of vdsl2(251).
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
"The value of this object identifies the row in the xDSL2 Line Configuration Template Table, xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable, that applies for this line.
This object MUST be maintained in a persistent manner."
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
"This object is used to identify the template that will be used if the xDSL2 line fails to operate using the primary template.
The primary template is identified using the xdsl2LineConfTemplate object.
For example, a xDSL2 line may fall back to a template with a lower rate if the rate specified in the primary template cannot be achieved.
The value of this object identifies a row in the xDSL2 Line Configuration Template Table, xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable.
Any row in the xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable table may be used as a fall back template.
If the xDSL2 line fails to operate using the fall back template, then the primary template should be retried.
The xTU C should continue to alternate between the primary and fall back templates until one of them succeeds.
If the value of this object is a zero length string, then no fall back template is defined and only the primary template will be used.
Note that implementation of this object is not mandatory.
If this object is not supported, any attempt to modify this object should result in the SET request being rejected.
This object MUST be maintained in a persistent manner."
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
"The value of this object identifies the row in the xDSL2 Line Alarm Configuration Template Table, xdsl2LineAlarmConfTemplateTable, which applies to this line.
This object MUST be maintained in a persistent manner."
current DESCRIPTION "Power management state forced (PMSF).
Defines the line states to be forced by the near end xTU on this line.
This object MUST be maintained in a persistent manner."
Loop diagnostic state forced (LDSF).
Defines whether the line should be forced into the loop diagnostics mode by the near end xTU of this line.
Note that a loop diagnostic may be initiated by the far end xTU at any time.
Only when the xdsl2LineStatusPwrMngState object is in the 'l3' state and the xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf object is in the 'l0orL2toL3' state, can the line be forced into loop diagnostic mode procedures.
Upon successful completion of the loop diagnostic mode procedures, the Access Node shall set this object to 'inhibit', and xdsl2LineStatusPwrMngState will remain in the 'l3' state.
The loop diagnostic data shall be available at least until xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf is set to the 'l3toL0' state.
The results of the loop diagnostic procedure are stored in the tables xdsl2SCStatusTable, xdsl2SCStatusBandTable, and xdsl2SCStatusSegmentTable.
The status of the loop diagnostic procedure is indicated by xdsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReason.
As long as loop diagnostic procedures are not completed successfully, attempts shall be made to do so, until the loop diagnostic mode is no longer forced on the line through this configuration parameter.
The status of the most recent occasion when the loop diagnostics state forced (LDSF) command was issued for the associated line."
Request a bits per subcarrier measurement to be made.
A request for a bits per subcarrier measurement is made by setting this object to the value of 'measure'.
Upon completion of the measurement request, the Access Node shall set this object to 'idle'.
The SNMP agent should allow initiating a bits per subcarrier measurement process only if there is no other bits per subcarrier measurement already running, and respond with an SNMP error (e.g., wrongValue) otherwise.
Note that a bits per subcarrier measurement is also performed during a line diagnostic procedure.
This object provides an additional mechanism to fetch the bits per subcarrier data.
This additional mechanism is provided so that bits per subcarrier data may be fetched without forcing the line into no power state.
This is useful because the bits per subcarrier allocation may be adjusted at show time due to rate adaption and bit swapping.
The implementation of this additional mechanism for measuring bits per subcarrier is not mandatory.
The results of the bits per subcarrier measurement are stored in xdsl2LineSegmentTable.
The status of the bits per subcarrier measurement is indicated by xdsl2LineCmndConfBpscFailReason.
The status of the most recent bits per subcarrier measurement request issued for the associated line."
This counter is incremented by one every time a request for a bits per subcarrier measurement is made.
A measurement request is made by modifying the xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc object from idle(1) to the value measure(2).
The measurement results may be very large and will not fit into a single PDU; hence, multiple SNMP GET requests may be required to fetch the measurement results.
Because the measurement results cannot be fetched atomically, it is possible for a second manager to start a new measurement before a first manager has fetched all of its results.
An SNMP manager can use this object to ensure that the measurement results retrieved using one or more GET requests all belong to the measurement initiated by that manager.
The following steps are suggested in order for the SNMP manager to initiate the bits per subcarrier measurement: 1.
Wait for xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc value to be idle(1).
Perform an SNMP GET for xdsl2LineCmndConfBpscRequests.
Wait a short delay (4   8 seconds).
Perform an SNMP SET on xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc with the value measure(2).
If step 4 returns an error, then go to step 1.
Wait for xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc value to be idle(1).
Fetch measurement results using one or more GET PDUs.
Perform an SNMP GET for xdsl2LineCmndConfBpscRequests.
Compute the difference between the two values of xdsl2LineCmndConfBpscRequests.
This parameter is defined in order to improve testing of the performance of xTUs supporting automode when it is enabled in the MIB.
Change the value of this parameter to 'true' to indicate a change in loop conditions applied to the devices under the test.
The xTUs shall reset any historical information used for automode and for shortening G.994.1 handshake and initialization.
Automode is the case where multiple operation modes are enabled through the xdsl2LConfProfXtuTransSysEna object in the line configuration profile being used for the line, and where the selection of the actual operation mode depends not only on the common capabilities of both xTUs (as exchanged in G.994.1), but also on achievable data rates under given loop conditions."
Request a line reset to occur.
If this object is set to the value of 'reset', then force the line to reset (i.e., the modems will retrain).
When the line has successfully reset, the SNMP agent will set the value of this object to 'idle'.
Note that the xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf object will always take precedence over this object.
If the xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf object is set to the value 'l0orL2toL3', then the line MUST NOT return to the Showtime state due to a reset request action performed using this object."
"This object is used to identify the template that is currently in use for this line.
This object is updated when a successful line initialization occurs.
This object indicates if the primary template (xdsl2LineConfTemplate) is in use or the fall back template (xdsl2LineConfFallbackTemplate) is in use.
If the line is not successfully initialized, then the value of this object will be a zero length string."

A management application intended to manage ADSL links (e.g., G.992.1) with this MIB module MUST be modified to adapt itself to certain differences between RFC 2662 [RFC2662] and this MIB module, including the following aspects:  Though the configuration templates/profiles allow referring to 1 4 bearer channels, ADSL links are limited to two channels at most.
Though the channel configuration profile allows higher data rates, ADSL links are limited to downstream/upstream data rate as assumed in RFC 2662 [RFC2662].
The Impulse Noise Protection (INP) configuration parameters are given by minimum protection and maximum delay parameters.
The line configuration profile includes a sub table that addresses mode specific parameters.
For ADSL links, the management application SHOULD create a row in that table for the ADSL modes only.
The line configuration profile includes parameters that are irrelevant for ADSL links.
Similarly, many status parameters in the MIB are irrelevant for certain ADSL modes.
Therefore, it is advised to consult with ITU G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] regarding the scope and relevance of each parameter in this MIB.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:  xdsl2LineTable
xdsl2LineCmndAutomodeColdStart    xdsl2LineCmndConfReset Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineConfTemplate could have a major adverse operational effect on many lines simultaneously.
Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineConfFallbackTemplate could have a major adverse operational effect on many lines simultaneously.
Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineAlarmConfTemplate could have a contrary effect on notifications.
Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndConfPmsf could have an adverse affect on the power consumption of a line and may disrupt an operational service.
Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndConfLdsf could cause an unscheduled line test to be carried out on the line.
Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc could cause an unscheduled bits per subcarrier measurement to be carried out on the line.
Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndAutomodeColdStart could cause an unscheduled cold reset to the line.
Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LineCmndConfReset could cause a unscheduled retrain of a line.
This table contains one object, xdsl2LineSegmentRowStatus, that supports SET operations.
Unauthorized changes could result in measurement results being deleted prematurely.
This table contains one object, xdsl2SCStatusRowStatus, that supports SET operations.
Unauthorized changes could result in line test results being deleted prematurely.
xdsl2LConfTempChan4RaRatioUs    xdsl2LConfTempRowStatus Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LConfTempLineProfile, xdsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile, xdsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile, xdsl2LConfTempChan3ConfProfile, or xdsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile could have an adverse operational effect on several lines; could change several lines over to running in unwanted levels of operation; or could result in several services undergoing changes in the number of channels that carry the service.
Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LConfTempChan1RaRatioDs, xdsl2LConfTempChan2RaRatioDs, xdsl2LConfTempChan3RaRatioDs, or xdsl2LConfTempChan4RaRatioDs would alter the relative rate allocations among all channels belonging to a line.
This could have an adverse operational effect on several lines.
Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LConfTempRowStatus could result in templates being created or brought into service prematurely, or they could result in templates being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
xdsl2LConfProfRowStatus Unauthorized changes resulting in the setting of any of the above objects to an incorrect value could have an adverse operational effect on several lines.
Also, unauthorized changes to xdsl2LConfProfRowStatus could result in unwanted line profiles being created or brought into service prematurely, or they could result in line profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
xdsl2LConfProfModeSpecRowStatus Unauthorized changes resulting in the setting of any of the above objects to an incorrect value could have an adverse operational effect on several lines.
Also, unauthorized changes to xdsl2LConfProfModeSpecRowStatus could result in unwanted PSD configurations being created or brought into service prematurely, or they could result in PSD configurations being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
xdsl2LConfProfModeSpecRowStatus Unauthorized changes resulting in the setting of any of the above objects to an incorrect value could have an adverse operational effect on several lines.
Also, unauthorized changes to xdsl2LConfProfModeSpecBandUsRowStatus could result in unwanted PSD configurations being created or brought into service prematurely, or they could result in PSD configurations being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
xdsl2ChConfProfRowStatus Unauthorized changes resulting in the setting of any of the above objects to an incorrect value could have an adverse operational effect on several lines.
Also, unauthorized changes to xdsl2ChConfProfRowStatus could result in unwanted channel profiles being created or brought into service prematurely, or they could result in channel profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
The table consists of the following objects that support SET operations:
xdsl2LalarmConfTempChan4ConfProfile    xdsl2LAlarmConfTempRowStatus Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LAlarmConfTempLineProfile, xdsl2LAlarmConfTempChan1ConfProfile, xdsl2LAlarmConfTempChan2ConfProfile, xdsl2LAlarmConfTempChan3ConfProfile, or xdsl2LAlarmConfTempChan4ConfProfile could have an adverse effect on the management of notifications generated at the scope of several to many lines, or they could change several to many lines over to running with unwanted management rates for generated notifications.
Unauthorized changes to xdsl2LAlarmConfTempRowStatus could result in alarm templates being created or brought into service prematurely, or they could result in alarm templates being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
The table consists of the following objects that support SET operations:
Increasing any of the threshold values could result in a notification being suppressed or deferred.
Setting a threshold to '0' could result in a notification being suppressed.
Suppressing or deferring a notification could prevent the timely delivery of important diagnostic information.
Decreasing any of the threshold values could result in a notification being sent from the network falsely reporting a threshold crossing.
Unauthorized changes to row status could result in unwanted line alarm profiles being created or brought into service.
Also, changes to the row status could result in line alarm profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
Increasing any of the threshold values could result in a notification being suppressed or deferred.
Setting a threshold to '0' could result in a notification being suppressed.
Suppressing or deferring a notification could prevent the timely delivery of important diagnostic information.
Decreasing any of the threshold values could result in a notification being sent from the network falsely reporting a threshold crossing.
Unauthorized changes to row status could result in unwanted channel alarm profiles being created or brought into service.
Also, changes to the row status could result in channel alarm profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
xdsl2LineInventoryTable Access to these objects would allow an intruder to obtain information about which vendor's equipment is in use on the network.
Further, such information is considered sensitive in many environments for competitive reasons.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], Section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
It is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access only to those objects whose principals (users) have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
