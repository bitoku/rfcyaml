Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing Multiprotocol Interconnect (including IP) traffic carried over X.25.
The objects defined here, along with the objects in the "SNMP MIB extension for the Packet Layer of X.25"[8], "SNMP MIB extension for LAPB"[7], and the "Definitions of Managed Objects for RS 232 like Hardware Devices" [6], combine to allow management of the traffic over an X.25 protocol stack.
The Internet standard Network Management Framework consists of three components.
These components give the rules for defining objects, the definitions of objects, and the protocol for manipulating objects.
The network management framework structures objects in an abstract information tree.
The branches of the tree name objects and the leaves of the tree contain the values manipulated to effect management.
This tree is called the Management Information Base or MIB.
The concepts of this tree are given in STD 16, RFC 1155, "The Structure of Management Information" or SMI [1].
The SMI defines the trunk of the tree and the types of objects used when defining the leaves.
STD 16, RFC 1212, "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [3], defines a more concise description mechanism that preserves all the principals of the SMI.
The core MIB definitions for the Internet suite of protocols can be found in STD 17, RFC 1213 [4], "Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP based internets".
[2] defines the SNMP protocol itself.
The protocol defines how to manipulate the objects in a remote MIB.
The tree structure of the MIB allows new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
The definition of an object in the MIB requires an object name and type.
Object names and types are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
[5] defined in the SMI [1].
Objects are named using ASN.1 object identifiers, administratively assigned names, to specify object types.
The object name, together with an optional object instance, uniquely identifies a specific instance of an object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to objects.
Objects also have a syntax that defines the abstract data structure corresponding to that object type.
The ASN.1 language [5] provides the primitives used for this purpose.
The SMI [1] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used for simplicity and ease of implementation.
Format of Definitions Section 4 contains the specification of all object types contained in this MIB module.
The object types are defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in "Towards Concise MIB Definitions" [3].
Scope Instances of the objects defined below provide management information for Multiprotocol Interconnect traffic on X.25 as defined in RFC 1356 [9].
That RFC describes how X.25 can be used to exchange IP or network level protocols.
The multiprotocol packets (IP, CLNP, ES IS, or SNAP) are encapsulated in X.25 frames for transmission between nodes.
All nodes that implement RFC 1356 must implement this MIB.
The objects in this MIB apply to the software in the node that manages X.25 connections and performs the protocol encapsulation.
A node in this usage maybe the end node source or destination host for the packet, or it may be a router or bridge responsible for forwarding the packet.
Since RFC 1356 requires X.25, nodes that implement RFC 1356 must also implement the X.25 MIB, RFC 1382.
This MIB only applies to Multiprotocol Interconnect over X.25 service.
It does not apply to other software that may also use X.25 (for example PAD).
Thus the presence, absence, or operation of such software will not directly affect any of these objects.
(However connections in use by that software will appear in the X.25 MIB).
Structure of MIB objects The objects of this MIB are organized into three tables:  the mioxPleTable, the mioxPeerTable, and the mioxPeerEncTable.
All objects in all tables are mandatory for conformance with this MIB.
The mioxPleTable defines information relative to an interface used to carry Multiprotocol Interconnect traffic over X.25.
Such interfaces are identified by an ifType object in the Internet standard MIB [4] of ddn x25 or rfc877 x25.
Interfaces of type ddn x25 have a self contained algorithm for translating between IP addresses and X.121 addresses.
rfc877 x25 do not have such an algorithm.
Note that not all X.25 Interfaces will be used to carry Multiprotocol Interconnect traffic.
Those interfaces not carrying such traffic will not have entries in the mioxPleTable.
The entries in the mioxPleTable are only for interfaces that do carry Multiprotocol Interconnect traffic over X.25.
Entries in the mioxPleTable are indexed by ifIndex to make it easy to find the mioxPleTable entry for an interface.
The mioxPeerTable contains information needed to contact an X.25 Peer to exchange packets.
This includes information such as the X.121 address of the peer and a pointer to the X.25 call parameters needed to place the call.
The instance identifiers used for the objects in this table are independent of any interface or other tables defined outside this MIB.
This table contains the ifIndex value of the X.25 interface to use to call a peer.
The mioxPeerEncTable contains information about the encapsulation type used to communicate with a peer.
This table is an extension of the mioxPeerTable in its instance identification.
Each entry in the mioxPeerTable may have zero or more entries in this table.
This table will not have any entries that do not have correspondent entries in mioxPeerTable.

"The number of X.25 calls from a remote systems to this system that were cleared by this system.
The interface instance should identify the X.25 interface the call came in on."
read only STATUS  mandatory DESCRIPTION
"The number of times a translation from an Encapsulated Address to an X.121 address failed to find a corresponding X.121 address.
Encapsulated addresses can be looked up in the mioxPeerTable or translated via an algorithm as for the DDN.
Addresses that are successfully recognized do not increment this counter.
Addresses that are not recognized (reflecting an abnormal packet delivery condition) increment this counter.
If an address translation fails, it may be difficult to determine which PLE entry should count the failure.
In such cases the first likely entry in this table should be selected.
Agents should record the failure even if they are unsure which PLE should be associated with the failure."
ACCESS  read only STATUS  mandatory DESCRIPTION
"The last Encapsulated address that failed to find a corresponding X.121 address and caused mioxPleEnAddrToX121LkupFlrs to be incremented.
The first octet of this object contains the encapsulation type, the remaining octets contain the address of that type that failed.
Thus for an IP address, the length will be five octets
, the first octet will contain 204 (hex CC), and the last four octets will contain the IP address.
For a snap encapsulation, the first byte would be 128 (hex 80) and the rest of the octet string would have the snap header."

Such connections occur when using ddn x25 IP X.25 address mapping or when accepting connections from other hosts not in the mioxPeerTable.
The mioxPeerEncTable entry with the same index as the mioxPeerTable entry specifies the call encapsulation types this PLE will accept for peers not in the mioxPeerTable.

All other defined values must be accepted.
Implementors should realize that allowing these values   provides richer management, and implementations   are encouraged to accept these values.
INTEGER { valid (1), createRequest (2), underCreation (3), invalid (4), clearCall (5), makeCall (6) } ACCESS  read write
"This reports the status of a peer entry.
A value of valid indicates a normal entry that is in use by the agent.
A value of underCreation indicates a newly created entry which isn't yet in use because the creating management station is still setting values.
The value of invalid indicates the entry is no longer in use and the agent is free to delete the entry at any time.
A management station is also free to use an entry in the invalid state.
Entries are created by setting a value of createRequest.
Only non existent or invalid entries can be set to createRequest.
Upon receiving a valid createRequest, the agent will create an entry in the underCreation state.
This object can not be set to a value of underCreation directly, entries can only be created by setting a value of createRequest.
Entries that exist in other than the invalid state can not be set to createRequest.
Entries with a value of underCreation are not used by the system and the management station can change the values of other objects in the table entry.
Management stations should also remember to configure values in the mioxPeerEncTable with the same peer index value as this peer entry.
An entry in the underCreation state can be set to valid or invalid.
Entries in the underCreation state will stay in that state until 1)
the agent times them out, 2)
they are set to valid, 3) they are set to invalid.
If an agent notices an entry has been in the underCreation state for an abnormally long time, it may decide the management station has failed and invalidate the entry.
A prudent agent will understand that the management station may need to wait for human input and will allow for that possibility in its determination of this abnormally long period.
Once a management station has completed all fields of an entry, it will set a value of valid.
This causes the entry to be activated.
Entries in the valid state may also be set to makeCall or clearCall to make or clear X.25 calls to the peer.
After such a set request the entry will still be in the valid state.
Setting a value of makeCall causes the agent to initiate an X.25 call request to the peer specified by the entry.
Setting a value of clearCall causes the agent to initiate clearing one X.25 call present to the peer.
Each set request will initiate another call or clear request (up to the maximum allowed); this means that management stations that fail to get a response to a set request should query to see if a call was in fact placed or cleared before retrying the request.
Entries not in the valid state can not be set to makeCall or clearCall.
The values of makeCall and clearCall provide for circuit control on devices which perform Ethernet Bridging using static circuit assignment without address recognition; other devices which dynamically place calls based on destination addresses may reject such requests.
An agent that (re)creates a new entry because of a set with createRequest, should also (re)create a mioxPeerEncTable entry with a mioxPeerEncIndex of 1, and a mioxPeerEncType of 204 (hex CC).

If two calls are open at the same time, one second of elapsed real time will results in two seconds of connect time."
"The instance of the index object in the x25CallParmTable from RFC 1382 for the X.25 call parameters used to communicate with the remote host.
The well known value {0 0} indicates no call parameters specified.
"The Encapsulation address of the remote host mapped by this table entry.
A length of zero indicates the remote IP address is unknown or unspecified for use as a PLE default.
The first octet of this object contains the encapsulation type, the remaining octets contain an address of that type.
Thus for an IP address, the length will be five octets
, the first octet will contain 204 (hex CC), and the last four octets will contain the IP address.
For a snap encapsulation, the first byte would be 128 (hex 80) and the rest of the octet string would have the snap header.
} mioxPeerX121Address OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"The X.25 address of the remote host mapped by this table entry.
A zero length string indicates the X.25 address is unspecified for use as the PLE default.
}   Systems can claim conformance to this MIB without   implementing sets to mioxPeerX25CircuitId.
However systems that use PVCs with RFC1356   are encouraged to implement sets.
"This object identifies the instance of the index for the X.25 circuit open to the peer mapped by this table entry.
The well known value {0 0} indicates no connection currently active.
For multiple connections, this identifies the index of a multiplexing table entry for the connections.
This can only be written to configure use of PVCs which means the identified circuit table entry for a write must be a PVC.
"This object returns any identification information about the peer.
An agent may supply the comment information found in the configuration file entry for this peer.
A zero length string indicates no information available.
"This table contains the list of encapsulations used to communicate with a peer.
This table has two indexes, the first identifies the peer, the second distinguishes encapsulation types.
The first index identifies the corresponding entry in the mioxPeerTable.
The second index gives the priority of the different encapsulations.
The encapsulation types are ordered in priority order.
For calling a peer, the first entry (mioxPeerEncIndex of 1) is tried first.
If the call doesn't succeed because the remote host clears the call due to incompatible call user data, the next entry in the list is tried.
Each entry is tried until the list is exhausted.
For answering a call, the encapsulation type requested by the peer must be found the list or the call will be refused.
If there are no entries in this table for a peer, all call requests from the peer will be refused.
Objects in this table can only be set when the mioxPeerStatus object with the same index has a value of underCreation.
When that status object is set to invalid and deleted, the entry in this table with that peer index must also be deleted."
mandatory DESCRIPTION "Per connection information.
read only STATUS    mandatory DESCRIPTION
"The second index in the table which distinguishes different encapsulation types."
"The value of the encapsulation type.
For IP encapsulation this will have a value of 204 (hex CC).
For SNAP encapsulated packets, this will have a value of 128 (hex 80).
For CLNP, ISO 8473, this will have a value of 129 (hex 81).
For ES ES, ISO 9542, this will have a value of 130 (hex 82).
A value of 197 (hex C5) identifies the Blacker X.25 encapsulation.
A value of 0, identifies the Null encapsulation.
This value can only be written when the mioxPeerStatus object with the same mioxPeerIndex has a value of underCreation.
Setting this object to a value of 256 deletes the entry.
When deleting an entry, all other entries in the mioxPeerEncTable with the same mioxPeerIndex and with an mioxPeerEncIndex higher then the deleted entry, will all have their mioxPeerEncIndex values decremented by one."
