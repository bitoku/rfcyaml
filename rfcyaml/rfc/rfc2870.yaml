  - "Abstract\n   As the internet becomes increasingly critical to the world's social\n\
    \   and economic infrastructure, attention has rightly focused on the\n   correct,\
    \ safe, reliable, and secure operation of the internet\n   infrastructure itself.\
    \  The root domain name servers are seen as a\n   crucial part of that technical\
    \ infrastructure.  The primary focus of\n   this document is to provide guidelines\
    \ for operation of the root name\n   servers.  Other major zone server operators\
    \ (gTLDs, ccTLDs, major\n   zones) may also find it useful.  These guidelines\
    \ are intended to\n   meet the perceived societal needs without overly prescribing\n\
    \   technical details.\n"
- title: 1. Background
  contents:
  - "1. Background\n   The resolution of domain names on the internet is critically\n\
    \   dependent on the proper, safe, and secure operation of the root\n   domain\
    \ name servers.  Currently, these dozen or so servers are\n   provided and operated\
    \ by a very competent and trusted group of\n   volunteers.  This document does\
    \ not propose to change that, but\n   merely to provide formal guidelines so that\
    \ the community understands\n   how and why this is done.\n   1.1 The Internet\
    \ Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)\n       has become responsible\
    \ for the operation of the root servers.\n       The ICANN has appointed a Root\
    \ Server System Advisory Committee\n       (RSSAC) to give technical and operational\
    \ advice to the ICANN\n       board.  The ICANN and the RSSAC look to the IETF\
    \ to provide\n       engineering standards.\n   1.2 The root servers serve the\
    \ root, aka \".\", zone.  Although today\n       some of the root servers also\
    \ serve some TLDs (top level domains)\n       such as gTLDs (COM, NET, ORG, etc.),\
    \ infrastructural TLDs such as\n       INT and IN-ADDR.ARPA, and some ccTLDs (country\
    \ code TLDs, e.g. SE\n       for Sweden), this is likely to change (see 2.5).\n\
    \   1.3 The root servers are neither involved with nor dependent upon the\n  \
    \     'whois' data.\n   1.4 The domain name system has proven to be sufficiently\
    \ robust that\n       we are confident that the, presumably temporary, loss of\
    \ most of\n       the root servers should not significantly affect operation of\
    \ the\n       internet.\n   1.5 Experience has shown that the internet is quite\
    \ vulnerable to\n       incorrect  data in the root zone or TLDs.  Hence authentication,\n\
    \       validation, and security of these data are of great concern.\n"
- title: 2. The Servers Themselves
  contents:
  - "2. The Servers Themselves\n   The following are requirements for the technical\
    \ details of the root\n   servers themselves:\n   2.1 It would be short-sighted\
    \ of this document to specify particular\n       hardware, operating systems,\
    \ or name serving software.\n       Variations in these areas would actually add\
    \ overall robustness.\n   2.2 Each server MUST run software which correctly implements\
    \ the IETF\n       standards for the DNS, currently [RFC1035] [RFC2181].  While\n\
    \       there are no formal test suites for standards compliance, the\n      \
    \ maintainers of software used on root servers are expected to take\n       all\
    \ reasonable actions to conform to the IETF's then current\n       documented\
    \ expectations.\n   2.3 At any time, each server MUST be able to handle a load\
    \ of\n       requests for root data which is three times the measured peak of\n\
    \       such requests on the most loaded server in then current normal\n     \
    \  conditions.  This is usually expressed in requests per second.\n       This\
    \ is intended to ensure continued operation of root services\n       should two\
    \ thirds of the servers be taken out of operation,\n       whether by intent,\
    \ accident, or malice.\n   2.4 Each root server should have sufficient connectivity\
    \ to the\n       internet to support the bandwidth needs of the above requirement.\n\
    \       Connectivity to the internet SHOULD be as diverse as possible.\n     \
    \  Root servers SHOULD have mechanisms in place to accept IP\n       connectivity\
    \ to the root server from any internet provider\n       delivering connectivity\
    \ at their own cost.\n   2.5 Servers MUST provide authoritative responses only\
    \ from the zones\n       they serve.  The servers MUST disable recursive lookup,\n\
    \       forwarding, or any other function that may allow them to provide\n   \
    \    cached answers.  They also MUST NOT provide secondary service for\n     \
    \  any zones other than the root and root-servers.net zones.  These\n       restrictions\
    \ help prevent undue load on the root servers and\n       reduce the chance of\
    \ their caching incorrect data.\n   2.6 Root servers MUST answer queries from\
    \ any internet host, i.e. may\n       not block root name resolution from any\
    \ valid IP address, except\n       in the case of queries causing operational\
    \ problems, in which\n       case the blocking SHOULD last only as long as the\
    \ problem, and be\n       as specific as reasonably possible.\n   2.7 Root servers\
    \ SHOULD NOT answer AXFR, or other zone transfer,\n       queries from clients\
    \ other than other root servers.  This\n       restriction is intended to, among\
    \ other things, prevent\n       unnecessary load on the root servers as advice\
    \ has been heard\n       such as \"To avoid having a corruptible cache, make your\
    \ server a\n       stealth secondary for the root zone.\"  The root servers MAY\
    \ put\n       the root zone up for ftp or other access on one or more less\n \
    \      critical servers.\n   2.8 Servers MUST generate checksums when sending\
    \ UDP datagrams and\n       MUST verify checksums when receiving UDP datagrams\
    \ containing a\n       non-zero checksum.\n"
- title: 3. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Security Considerations\n   The servers need both physical and protocol security\
    \ as well as\n   unambiguous authentication of their responses.\n   3.1 Physical\
    \ security MUST be ensured in a manner expected of data\n       centers critical\
    \ to a major enterprise.\n        3.1.1 Whether or not the overall site in which\
    \ a root server is\n              located has access control, the specific area\
    \ in which the\n              root server is located MUST have positive access\
    \ control,\n              i.e. the number of individuals permitted access to the\n\
    \              area MUST be limited, controlled, and recorded.  At a\n       \
    \       minimum, control measures SHOULD be either mechanical or\n           \
    \   electronic locks.  Physical security MAY be enhanced by\n              the\
    \ use of intrusion detection and motion sensors,\n              multiple serial\
    \ access points, security personnel, etc.\n        3.1.2 Unless there is documentable\
    \ experience that the local\n              power grid is more reliable than the\
    \ MTBF of a UPS (i.e.\n              five to ten years), power continuity for\
    \ at least 48 hours\n              MUST be assured, whether through on-site batteries,\
    \ on-\n              site power generation, or some combination thereof.  This\n\
    \              MUST supply the server itself, as well as the\n              infrastructure\
    \ necessary to connect the server to the\n              internet.  There MUST\
    \ be procedures which ensure that\n              power fallback mechanisms and\
    \ supplies are tested no less\n              frequently than the specifications\
    \ and recommendations of\n              the manufacturer.\n        3.1.3 Fire\
    \ detection and/or retardation MUST be provided.\n        3.1.4 Provision MUST\
    \ be made for rapid return to operation after\n              a system outage.\
    \  This SHOULD involve backup of systems\n              software and configuration.\
    \  But SHOULD also involve\n              backup hardware which is pre-configured\
    \ and ready to take\n              over operation, which MAY require manual procedures.\n\
    \   3.2 Network security should be of the level provided for critical\n      \
    \ infrastructure of a major commercial enterprise.\n        3.2.1 The root servers\
    \ themselves MUST NOT provide services\n              other than root name service\
    \ e.g.  remote internet\n              protocols such as http, telnet, rlogin,\
    \ ftp, etc.  The\n              only login accounts permitted should be for the\
    \ server\n              administrator(s).  \"Root\" or \"privileged user\" access\
    \ MUST\n              NOT be permitted except through an intermediate user\n \
    \             account.\n              Servers MUST have a secure mechanism for\
    \ remote\n              administrative access and maintenance.  Failures happen;\n\
    \              given the 24x7 support requirement (per 4.5), there will\n    \
    \          be times when something breaks badly enough that senior\n         \
    \     wizards will have to connect remotely.  Remote logins MUST\n           \
    \   be protected by a secure means that is strongly\n              authenticated\
    \ and encrypted, and sites from which remote\n              login is allowed MUST\
    \ be protected and hardened.\n        3.2.2 Root name servers SHOULD NOT trust\
    \ other hosts, except\n              secondary servers trusting the primary server,\
    \ for matters\n              of authentication, encryption keys, or other access\
    \ or\n              security information.  If a root operator uses kerberos\n\
    \              authentication to manage access to the root server, then\n    \
    \          the associated kerberos key server MUST be protected with\n       \
    \       the same prudence as the root server itself.  This applies\n         \
    \     to all related services which are trusted in any manner.\n        3.2.3\
    \ The LAN segment(s) on which a root server is homed MUST\n              NOT also\
    \ home crackable hosts.  I.e. the LAN segments\n              should be switched\
    \ or routed so there is no possibility of\n              masquerading.  Some LAN\
    \ switches aren't suitable for\n              security purposes, there have been\
    \ published attacks on\n              their filtering.  While these can often\
    \ be prevented by\n              careful configuration, extreme prudence is recommended.\n\
    \              It is best if the LAN segment simply does not have any\n      \
    \        other hosts on it.\n        3.2.4 The LAN segment(s) on which a root\
    \ server is homed SHOULD\n              be separately firewalled or packet filtered\
    \ to discourage\n              network access to any port other than those needed\
    \ for\n              name service.\n        3.2.5 The root servers SHOULD have\
    \ their clocks synchronized via\n              NTP [RFC1305] [RFC2030] or similar\
    \ mechanisms, in as\n              secure manner as possible.  For this purpose,\
    \ servers and\n              their associated firewalls SHOULD allow the root\
    \ servers\n              to be NTP clients.  Root servers MUST NOT act as NTP\
    \ peers\n              or servers.\n        3.2.6 All attempts at intrusion or\
    \ other compromise SHOULD be\n              logged, and all such logs from all\
    \ root servers SHOULD be\n              analyzed by a cooperative security team\
    \ communicating with\n              all server operators to look for patterns,\
    \ serious\n              attempts, etc.  Servers SHOULD log in GMT to facilitate\n\
    \              log comparison.\n        3.2.7 Server logging SHOULD be to separate\
    \ hosts which SHOULD be\n              protected similarly to the root servers\
    \ themselves.\n        3.2.8 The server SHOULD be protected from attacks based\
    \ on\n              source routing.  The server MUST NOT rely on address- or\n\
    \              name-based authentication.\n        3.2.9 The network on which\
    \ the server is homed SHOULD have\n              in-addr.arpa service.\n   3.3\
    \ Protocol authentication and security are required to ensure that\n       data\
    \ presented by the root servers are those created by those\n       authorized\
    \ to maintain the root zone data.\n        3.3.1 The root zone MUST be signed\
    \ by the Internet Assigned\n              Numbers Authority (IANA) in accordance\
    \ with DNSSEC, see\n              [RFC2535] or its replacements.  It is understood\
    \ that\n              DNSSEC is not yet deployable on some common platforms, but\n\
    \              will be deployed when supported.\n        3.3.2 Root servers MUST\
    \ be DNSSEC-capable so that queries may be\n              authenticated by clients\
    \ with security and authentication\n              concerns.  It is understood\
    \ that DNSSEC is not yet\n              deployable on some common platforms, but\
    \ will be deployed\n              when supported.\n        3.3.3 Transfer of the\
    \ root zone between root servers MUST be\n              authenticated and be as\
    \ secure as reasonably possible.\n              Out of band security validation\
    \ of updates MUST be\n              supported.  Servers MUST use DNSSEC to authenticate\
    \ root\n              zones received from other servers.  It is understood that\n\
    \              DNSSEC is not yet deployable on some common platforms, but\n  \
    \            will be deployed when supported.\n        3.3.4 A 'hidden primary'\
    \ server, which only allows access by the\n              authorized secondary\
    \ root servers, MAY be used.\n        3.3.5 Root zone updates SHOULD only progress\
    \ after a number of\n              heuristic checks designed to detect erroneous\
    \ updates have\n              been passed.  In case the update fails the tests,\
    \ human\n              intervention MUST be requested.\n        3.3.6 Root zone\
    \ updates SHOULD normally be effective no later\n              than 6 hours from\
    \ notification of the root server\n              operator.\n        3.3.7 A special\
    \ procedure for emergency updates SHOULD be\n              defined.  Updates initiated\
    \ by the emergency procedure\n              SHOULD be made no later than 12 hours\
    \ after notification.\n        3.3.8 In the advent of a critical network failure,\
    \ each root\n              server MUST have a method to update the root zone data\
    \ via\n              a medium which is delivered through an alternative, non-\n\
    \              network, path.\n        3.3.9 Each root MUST keep global statistics\
    \ on the amount and\n              types of queries received/answered on a daily\
    \ basis. These\n              statistics must be made available to RSSAC and RSSAC\n\
    \              sponsored researchers to help determine how to better\n       \
    \       deploy these machines more efficiently across the\n              internet.\
    \  Each root MAY collect data snapshots to help\n              determine data\
    \ points such as DNS query storms,\n              significant implementation bugs,\
    \ etc.\n"
