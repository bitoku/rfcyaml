- title: 2. Object Identifier for Content and Key Encryption
  contents:
  - "2. Object Identifier for Content and Key Encryption\n   The Cryptographic Message\
    \ Syntax [CMS], derived from PKCS#7 [PKCS7],\n   is the framework for the implementation\
    \ of cryptographic functions in\n   S/MIME.  It specifies data formats and encryption\
    \ processes without\n   naming the cryptographic algorithms.  Each algorithm which\
    \ is used\n   for encryption purposes must be specified by a unique algorithm\n\
    \   identifier.  For example, in the special case of content encryption\n   the\
    \ ContentEncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier specifies the algorithm to\n   be applied.\
    \  However, according to [CMS] any symmetric encryption\n   algorithm that a CMS\
    \ implementation includes as a content-encryption\n   algorithm must also be included\
    \ as a key-encryption algorithm.\n   IDEA is added to the set of optional symmetric\
    \ encryption algorithms\n   in S/MIME by providing two unique object identifiers\
    \ (OIDs).  One OID\n   defines content encryption and the other one key encryption.\
    \  Thus an\n   S/MIME agent can apply IDEA either for content or key encryption\
    \ by\n   selecting the corresponding object identifier, supplying the required\n\
    \   parameter, and starting the program code.\n   For content encryption the use\
    \ of IDEA in cipher block chaining (CBC)\n   mode is recommended.  The key length\
    \ is fixed to 128 bits.\n   The IDEA content-encryption algorithm in CBC mode\
    \ has the object\n   identifier\n     IDEA-CBC OBJECT IDENTIFIER\n       ::= {\
    \ iso(1) identified-organization(3)\n           usdod(6) oid(1) private(4) enterprises(1)\n\
    \           ascom(188) systec(7) security(1) algorithms(1) 2 }\n   The identifier's\
    \ parameters field contains the initialization vector\n   (IV) as an optional\
    \ parameter.\n     IDEA-CBCPar ::= SEQUENCE {\n       iv  OCTET STRING OPTIONAL\
    \ } -- exactly 8 octets\n   If IV is specified as above, it MUST be used as initial\
    \ vector.  In\n   this case, the ciphertext MUST NOT include the initial vector.\
    \  If IV\n   is not specified, the first 64 bits of the ciphertext MUST be\n \
    \  considered as the initial vector.  However, this alternative of not\n   including\
    \ IV into \"iv OCTET STRING\" of IDEA-CBCPar SHOULD NOT be\n   applied in CMS\
    \ or S/MIME.\n   The key-wrap/unwrap algorithms used to encrypt/decrypt an IDEA\n\
    \   content-encryption key with an IDEA key-encryption key are specified\n   in\
    \ the following section.  Generation and distribution of IDEA key-\n   encryption\
    \ keys are beyond the scope of this document.\n   The IDEA key-encryption algorithm\
    \ has the object identifier\n     id-alg-CMSIDEAwrap OBJECT IDENTIFIER\n     \
    \  ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3)\n           usdod(6) oid(1) private(4)\
    \ enterprises(1)\n           ascom(188) systec(7) security(1) algorithms(1) 6\
    \ }\n   The identifier's parameters field MUST be NULL.\n"

- title: 5. Activation of IDEA in S/MIME Clients
  contents:
  - "5. Activation of IDEA in S/MIME Clients\n   When a sending agent creates an encrypted\
    \ message, it has to decide\n   which type of encryption algorithm to use.  In\

    \ lists\n   included in messages received from the recipient, as well as other\n\
    \   information such as private agreements, user preferences, legal\n   restrictions,\
    \ etc.  If users require IDEA for symmetric encryption,\n   it must be supported\
    \ by the S/MIME clients on both the sending and\n   receiving side, and it must\
    \ be set in the user preferences.\n"

- title: B. Comments on IDEA Security and Standards

  - "B. Comments on IDEA Security and Standards\n   The IDEA algorithm was developed\
    \ in a joint project involving the\n   Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in\
    \ Zurich (Dr. X. Lai and Prof.\n   J.L. Massey) and Ascom Ltd.  The aim of the\
    \ project was to develop a\n   strong encryption algorithm that could replace\
    \ the DES algorithm.\n   IDEA uses 128-bit secret keys and encrypts one 64-bit\
    \ block at a time\n   [IDEA].  It was particularly strengthened to protect against\n\
    \   differential cryptoanalysis attacks.  For the full 8-round IDEA there\n  \
    \ is no attack known which is better than exhaustive search on the\n   total 128-bit\
    \ key space.\n   IDEA permits the implementation of standard Electronic Data\n\
    \   Interchange applications.  It has been entered in the ISO/IEC\n   register\

    \ code list by the UNI/EDIFACT \"SECURITY JOINT WORKING\n   GROUP\".\n"
