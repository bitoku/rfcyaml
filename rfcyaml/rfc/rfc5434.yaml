  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides suggestions on how to host a successful\
    \ BOF at\n   an IETF meeting.  It is hoped that by documenting the methodologies\n\
    \   that have proven successful, as well as listing some pitfalls, BOF\n   organizers\
    \ will improve their chances of hosting a BOF with a\n   positive outcome.\n \
    \  There are many reasons for hosting a BOF.  Some BOFs are not intended\n   to\
    \ result in the formation of a Working Group (WG).  For example, a\n   BOF might\
    \ be a one-shot presentation on a particular issue, in order\n   to provide information\
    \ to the IETF Community.  Another example might\n   be to host an open meeting\
    \ to discuss specific open issues with a\n   document that is not associated with\
    \ an active WG, but for which\n   face-to-face interaction is needed to resolve\
    \ issues.  In many cases,\n   however, the intent is to form a WG.  In those cases,\
    \ the goal of the\n   BOF is to demonstrate that the community has agreement that:\n\
    \      - there is a problem that needs solving, and the IETF is the right\n  \
    \      group to attempt solving it.\n      - there is a critical mass of participants\
    \ willing to work on the\n        problem (e.g., write drafts, review drafts,\
    \ etc.).\n      - the scope of the problem is well defined and understood, that\n\
    \        is, people generally understand what the WG will work on (and\n     \
    \   what it won't) and what its actual deliverables will be.\n      - there is\
    \ agreement that the specific deliverables (i.e.,\n        proposed documents)\
    \ are the right set.\n      - it is believed that the WG has a reasonable probability\
    \ of\n        having success (i.e., in completing the deliverables in its\n  \
    \      charter in a timely fashion).\n   Additional details on WGs and BOFs can\
    \ be found in [RFC2418].\n"
- title: 2.  Recommended Steps
  contents:
  - "2.  Recommended Steps\n   The following steps present a sort of \"ideal\" sequence\
    \ for hosting a\n   BOF where the goal is the formation of a working group.  The\n\
    \   important observation to make here is that most of these steps\n   involve\
    \ planning for and engaging in significant public discussion,\n   and allowing\
    \ for sufficient time for iteration and broad\n   participation, so that much\
    \ of the work of the BOF can be done on a\n   public mailing list in advance of\
    \ -- rather than during -- the BOF\n   itself.\n   It is also important to recognize\
    \ the timing constraints.  As\n   described in detail below, the deadline for\
    \ scheduling BOFs is\n   approximately six weeks prior to an IETF meeting.  Working\
    \ backwards\n   from that date, taking into consideration the time required to\
    \ write\n   drafts, have public discussion, allow the ADs to evaluate the\n  \
    \ proposed BOF, etc., the right time to start preparing for a BOF is\n   almost\
    \ certainly the meeting prior to the one in which the BOF is\n   desired.  By\
    \ implication, starting the work aimed at leading to a BOF\n   only 2 months prior\
    \ to an IETF meeting is, in most cases, waiting too\n   long, and will likely\
    \ result in the BOF being delayed until the\n   following IETF meeting.\n   The\
    \ recommended steps for a BOF are as follows:\n   1) A small group of individuals\
    \ gets together privately, discusses a\n      possible problem statement, and\
    \ identifies the work to be done.\n      The group acts as a sort of \"design\
    \ team\" to formulate a problem\n      statement, identify possible work items,\
    \ and propose an agenda for\n      a BOF.\n      Possible sub-steps:\n      a)\
    \ Consider whether the work might already fall within the scope\n         of an\
    \ existing Working Group, in which case a BOF might not\n         even be necessary.\
    \  Individual Working Group charters can be\n         found at http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/wg-dir.html\
    \ and\n         indicate what a group is scoped to work on.\n      b) Select the\
    \ area or areas in which the work most naturally fits\n         by identifying\
    \ WGs that most closely relate to the proposed\n         work.  Note that it is\
    \ not uncommon to find that a work item\n         could easily fit into two (or\
    \ more) different areas and that no\n         one area is the obvious home.\n\
    \      c) Consult with specific WGs to see whether there is interest or\n    \
    \     whether the work is in scope.  This can be done by posting\n         messages\
    \ directly to WG mailing lists, contacting the WG\n         chairs, or contacting\
    \ individuals known to participate in a\n         particular WG (e.g., from their\
    \ postings or from documents they\n         have authored).\n      d) Consult\
    \ with an area-specific mailing list about possible\n         interest.  (Most\
    \ areas have their own area-specific mailing\n         lists.  Follow the links\
    \ under each area at\n         http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/wg-dir.html to\
    \ find details.)\n      e) Produce one or more Internet Drafts, describing the\
    \ problem\n         and/or related work.  It cannot be emphasized enough that,\
    \ for\n         the BOF, drafts relating to understanding the problem space are\n\
    \         much more valuable than drafts proposing specific solutions.\n     \
    \ Timeline: This step can easily take 1-2 months; hence, begin 3-4\n      months\
    \ before an IETF meeting.\n   2) The group may (or may not) approach an Area Director\
    \ (or other\n      recognized or experienced leader) to informally float the BOF\
    \ and\n      get feedback on the proposed work, scope of the charter, specific\n\
    \      steps that need to be taken before submitting a formal BOF\n      request,\
    \ etc.  By \"leader\", we mean persons with significant IETF\n      experience\
    \ who can provide helpful advice; individuals who have\n      successfully hosted\
    \ BOFs before, current or former WG chairs, and\n      IESG or IAB members would\
    \ be good candidates.\n      The dividing line between steps 1) and 2) is not\
    \ exact.  At some\n      point, one will need to approach one or more Area Directors\
    \ (ADs)\n      with a specific proposal that can be commented on.  Step 1) helps\n\
    \      shape an idea into something concrete enough that an AD can\n      understand\
    \ the purpose and provide concrete feedback.  On the\n      other hand, one shouldn't\
    \ spend too much time on step 1) if the\n      answer at step 2) would turn out\
    \ to be \"oh, we had a BOF on that\n      once before; have you reviewed the archives?\"\
    .  Thus, there may be\n      some iteration involving going back and forth between\
    \ steps 1) and\n      2).  Also, a quick conversation with an AD might lead them\
    \ to\n      suggest some specific individuals or WGs you should consult with.\n\
    \      It may turn out that it is unclear in which area the proposed work\n  \
    \    best fits.  In such cases, when approaching multiple ADs, it is\n      best\
    \ to approach the ADs approximately simultaneously, state that\n      you are\
    \ unsure in which area the work fits, and ask for advice\n      (e.g., by stating\
    \ \"I'm not sure which area this work best fits\n      under, but it looks like\
    \ it might be Internet or Security or\n      both\").  When contacting multiple\
    \ ADs, it is strongly advised that\n      you inform them of which other ADs you\
    \ are conversing with.  In\n      particular, it is usually counterproductive\
    \ and not advisable to\n      go \"AD shopping\", where if one AD gives you an\
    \ answer you don't\n      like, you go to another, without telling him/her what\
    \ the first AD\n      said, in the hopes of getting a more favorable answer.\n\
    \      To summarize, steps 1) and 2) involve a lot of \"socializing an\n     \
    \ idea\", that is, having discussions with a number of different\n      people\
    \ to attempt gaining agreement on the problem and the need\n      for and appropriateness\
    \ of having a BOF.  How much such discussion\n      is needed is very subjective,\
    \ but it is critical in terms of\n      getting agreement that a BOF is appropriate.\
    \  One way to tell if\n      you are close to getting it right: when talking to\
    \ someone about\n      your idea for the first time, they quickly agree that a\
    \ BOF seems\n      in order and don't have any major concerns.\n      Timeline:\
    \ Steps 1-2) can easily take 1-2 months; hence, begin 3-4\n      months before\
    \ an IETF meeting.\n   3) Create a public mailing list and post a \"call for participation\"\
    \n      for the proposed BOF topic on various mailing lists (e.g., the\n     \
    \ IETF list).  The call for participation advertises that a\n      \"community\
    \ of interest\" is being formed to gauge whether there is\n      sufficient interest\
    \ to host a BOF.  The goal is to draw in other\n      interested potential participants,\
    \ to allow them to help shape the\n      BOF (e.g., by giving them time to write\
    \ a draft, ask for agenda\n      time, help scope the work of the proposed work,\
    \ argue that a BOF\n      is (or is not) needed, etc.).\n      Timeline: This\
    \ step can easily take 1 month or longer; it also\n      needs to be started well\
    \ before the Internet-Drafts cutoff (to\n      allow participants to submit drafts);\
    \ hence, begin 2.5-3.5 months\n      before the IETF meeting.\n   4) Have substantive\
    \ mailing list discussion.  It is not enough for a\n      handful of people to\
    \ assert that they want a BOF; there needs to\n      be broader community interest.\
    \  A public mailing list allows ADs\n      (and others) to gauge how much interest\
    \ there really is on a topic\n      area, as well as gauge how well the problem\
    \ statement has been\n      scoped, etc.  At this phase of the BOF preparation,\
    \ the emphasis\n      should be on getting agreement on the problem statement;\n\
    \      discussions about specific solutions tend to be distracting and\n     \
    \ unhelpful.\n      Timeline: this step can easily take 1 month or longer; hence,\n\
    \      begin 2.5 months before the IETF meeting.\n   5) Submit a formal request\
    \ to have a BOF.  Instructions for\n      submitting a formal request can be found\
    \ at\n      http://www.ietf.org/instructions/MTG-SLOTS.html and\n      http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1bof-procedures.txt.\
    \  Note that as part\n      of making a formal request, the organizers must identify\
    \ the area\n      in which the BOF will be held (the Area Directors of that area\n\
    \      will be required to approve the BOF), include a proposed BOF\n      agenda,\
    \ estimate the attendance, list conflicts with other\n      sessions that should\
    \ be avoided, etc.\n      If the previous steps have been followed, the Area Directors\
    \ (ADs)\n      should be in a good position to gauge whether there is sufficient\n\
    \      interest to justify approval of a BOF.\n      Note: it almost goes without\
    \ saying that without one or more\n      Internet Drafts at this point, it is\
    \ generally pointless to ask an\n      AD to approve a BOF.\n      Timeline: The\
    \ Secretariat publishes an \"important meeting dates\"\n      calendar along with\
    \ meeting information.  There is a firm deadline\n      (about six weeks prior\
    \ to the meeting) for submitting a formal BOF\n      scheduling request.  Note\
    \ that at the time of the deadline, an AD\n      will need to have sufficient\
    \ information about the BOF to approve\n      or reject the request, so all of\
    \ the previous steps will need to\n      have completed.\n   6) During the 2-4\
    \ weeks before an IETF (assuming a BOF has been\n      approved and scheduled),\
    \ the focus (on the mailing list) should be\n      on identifying areas of agreement\
    \ and areas of disagreement.\n      Since disagreement, or \"lack of consensus\"\
    , tends to be the main\n      reason for not forming a WG, focusing on those specific\
    \ areas\n      where \"lack of consensus\" exists is critically important.  In\n\
    \      general, only after those disagreements have been resolved will a\n   \
    \   WG be formed; thus, the main goal should be to find consensus and\n      work\
    \ through the areas of disagreement.  Alternatively, a specific\n      case should\
    \ be made about why the charter, as it is written, is\n      the best one, in\
    \ spite of the stated opposition.\n   7) Prior to the BOF, it is critical to produce\
    \ a proposed charter and\n      iterate on it on the mailing list to attempt to\
    \ get a consensus\n      charter.  Ultimately, the most important question to\
    \ ask during a\n      BOF is: \"should a WG with the following charter be formed?\"\
    .  It\n      goes without saying that a charter with shortcomings (no matter\n\
    \      how seemingly trivial to fix) will not achieve consensus if folk\n    \
    \  still have issues with the specific wording.\n   8) Decide what questions will\
    \ be asked during the BOF itself.  Since\n      the exact wording of the questions\
    \ is critical (and hard to do on\n      the fly), it is strongly recommended that\
    \ those questions be\n      floated on the mailing list and to the ADs prior to\
    \ the BOF.  This\n      will enable people to understand what they will be asked\
    \ to\n      approve and will allow the questions to be modified (prior to the\n\
    \      BOF) to remove ambiguities, etc.  Likewise, discussing these\n      questions\
    \ in advance may lead to refinement of the charter so that\n      the questions\
    \ can be answered affirmatively.\n   9) At the meeting, but before the BOF takes\
    \ place, plan a meeting\n      with all of the presenters to have them meet each\
    \ other, review\n      the agenda, and make sure everyone understands what is\
    \ expected of\n      them (e.g., what time constraints they will be under when\n\
    \      presenting).  Use this time to also work through any disagreements\n  \
    \    that still remain.  Do the same \"in the hallway\" with other\n      interested\
    \ parties!\n   10) Consult the tutorial schedule and consider attending relevant\n\
    \       tutorial sessions (\"Working Group Chair Training\", \"Working Group\n\
    \       Leadership Training\", etc.).  This is especially the case if you\n  \
    \     are considering being the chair of a proposed WG.  Since the role\n    \
    \   of the WG chair and BOF chair have a number of parallels, a\n       number\
    \ of the topics covered in the tutorial apply to hosting a\n       BOF and developing\
    \ a charter.\n"
- title: 3.  The Importance of Understanding the Real Problem
  contents:
  - "3.  The Importance of Understanding the Real Problem\n   Throughout the process\
    \ of chartering new work in the IETF, a key\n   issue is understanding (and finding\
    \ consensus) on what the real,\n   underlying problem is that the customer, operator,\
    \ or deployer of a\n   technology has and that the WG needs to address.  When\
    \ a WG finishes\n   an effort, the WG's output will only be useful if it actually\
    \ solves\n   a real, compelling problem faced by the actual user of the technology\n\
    \   (i.e., the customer or operator).  Unfortunately, there have been\n   more\
    \ than a few IETF WGs whose output was not adopted, and in some of\n   those cases\
    \ the cause was a lack of understanding of the real problem\n   the operator had.\
    \  In the end, the WG's output simply didn't address\n   the right problem.\n\
    \   Another issue that can happen is discussions about specific (or\n   competing)\
    \ solution approaches effectively stalemating the WG (or\n   BOF), making it unable\
    \ to make progress.  In some of those cases, the\n   arguments about the appropriateness\
    \ of specific technologies are\n   actually proxies for the question of whether\
    \ a proposed approach\n   adequately addresses the problem.  If there is a lack\
    \ of clarity\n   about the actual underlying problem to be solved, there may well\
    \ be\n   unresolvable arguments about the suitability of a particular\n   technical\
    \ approach, depending on one's view of the actual problem and\n   the constraints\
    \ associated with it.  Hence, it is critical for all\n   work to be guided by\
    \ a clear and shared understanding of the\n   underlying problem.\n   The best\
    \ description and understanding of an actual problem usually\n   comes from the\
    \ customer, operator, or deployer of a technology.  They\n   are the ones that\
    \ most clearly understand the difficulties they have\n   (that need addressing)\
    \ and they are the ones who will have to deploy\n   any proposed solution.  Thus,\
    \ it is critical to hear their voice when\n   formulating the details of the problem\
    \ statement.  Moreover, when\n   evaluating the relative merits of differing solution\
    \ approaches, it\n   is often helpful to go back to the underlying problem statement\
    \ for\n   guidance in selecting the more appropriate approach.\n"
- title: 4.  The BOF Itself
  contents:
  - "4.  The BOF Itself\n   For the BOF itself, it is critically important to focus\
    \ on the bottom\n   line:\n      What is it that one is attempting to achieve\
    \ during the BOF?\n   Or, stated differently, after the BOF is over, by what criteria\
    \ will\n   you decide whether or not the BOF was successful?\n   A good BOF organizer\
    \ keeps a firm focus on the purpose of the BOF and\n   crafts an agenda in support\
    \ of that goal.  Just as important,\n   presentations that do not directly support\
    \ the goal should be\n   excluded, as they often become distractions, sow confusion,\
    \ and\n   otherwise take focus away from the purpose of the BOF.  If the goal\n\
    \   is to form a WG, everything should lead to an (obvious) answer to the\n  \
    \ following question:\n      Does the room agree that the IETF should form a WG\
    \ with the\n      following (specific) charter?\n   One of the best ways to ensure\
    \ a \"yes\" answer to the above, is by\n   performing adequate preparation before\
    \ the BOF to ensure that the\n   community as a whole already agrees that the\
    \ answer is \"yes\".  How\n   does one do that?  One good way seems to be:\n \
    \  1) Have a public discussion with sufficient time to allow iteration\n     \
    \ and discussion.  (Hence, start a minimum of 3 months prior to the\n      IETF\
    \ meeting.)\n   2) Work with the community to iterate on the charter and be sure\
    \ to\n      address the significant concerns that are being raised.  (One can\n\
    \      address the concerns in advance -- and get advance agreement -- or\n  \
    \    one can have those concerns be raised (again) during the BOF -- in\n    \
    \  which case it is likely that the proposed charter will not be good\n      enough\
    \ to get agreement during the actual BOF).\n   3) During the BOF, keep the agenda\
    \ tightly focused on supporting the\n      need for the WG and otherwise making\
    \ the case that the group has\n      identified a clearly-scoped charter and has\
    \ agreement on what the\n      set of deliverables should be.\n   Another important\
    \ reason for holding a BOF is to establish an\n   understanding of how the attendees\
    \ (and the larger community) feel\n   about the proposed work.  Do they understand\
    \ and agree on the problem\n   that needs solving?  Do they agree the problem\
    \ is solvable, or that\n   new protocol work is needed?  To better understand\
    \ the degree of\n   agreement, it is useful to ask the audience questions.\n \
    \  Whenever asking questions, it is important to ask the right ones --\n   questions\
    \ that show where there is agreement and questions that probe\n   the details\
    \ around where agreement is lacking.  Good questions\n   typically focus on aspects\
    \ of the problem in a piecewise fashion,\n   establishing areas of consensus and\
    \ identifying areas where\n   additional work is needed.  Poor questions do not\
    \ serve to focus\n   future discussion where it is needed.  The following are\
    \ examples of\n   questions that are often useful to ask.\n   1) Is there support\
    \ to form a WG with the following charter?  (That\n      is, the charter itself\
    \ is ready, as shown by community support.)\n   2) Does the community think that\
    \ the problem statement is clear,\n      well-scoped, solvable, and useful to\
    \ solve?\n   3) Can I see a show of hands of folk willing to review documents\
    \ (or\n      comment on the mailing list)?\n   4) Who would be willing to serve\
    \ as an editor for the following\n      document(s)?  (BOF chairs should take\
    \ note of individuals who\n      raise their hands, but it is also a useful gauge\
    \ to see if there\n      is a critical mass of editors to work on all the documents\
    \ that\n      are to be produced.)\n   5) Does the community think that given\

  - "5.  Post-BOF Follow-Up\n   After the BOF has taken place, it is advisable to\
    \ take assessment of\n   how well things went and what the next steps are.  The\
    \ ADs should be\n   included in this assessment.  Some things to consider:\n \
    \  1) Did the BOF go well enough that the logical next step is to focus\n    \
    \  on refining the charter and becoming a WG before the next IETF\n      meeting?\
    \  If so, there will almost certainly be additional\n      discussion on the mailing\
    \ list to refine the charter and work out\n      a few remaining items.\n    \
    \  Note that it can be difficult to determine in some cases whether a\n      WG\
    \ is a feasible next step.  Much will depend on details of how\n      the BOF\
    \ went and/or whether the contentious items can either be\n      resolved on the\
    \ mailing list or simply be excluded from the\n      charter and dealt with later\
    \ (if at all).  Much will also depend\n      on the relevant AD's assessment of\
    \ whether the proposed work is\n      ready to move forward.  Sometimes even a\
    \ seemingly contentious BOF\n      can result in a WG being formed quickly --\
    \ provided the charter is\n      scoped appropriately.\n      If the next step\
    \ is to attempt to form a WG, the charter needs to\n      be finalized on the\
    \ BOF-specific mailing list.  Once done, the\n      IESG can be asked to formally\
    \ consider the charter.  The IESG then\n      (usually) posts the proposed charter\
    \ to the IETF list for\n      community feedback and makes a decision based in\
    \ part on the\n      feedback it receives.\n   2) It may be the case that enough\
    \ additional work still needs to take\n      place that aiming for a second (and\
    \ final) BOF makes more sense.\n      In that case, many of the steps outlined\
    \ earlier in this document\n      would be repeated, though at a faster pace.\n\
    \      The expectations for a second BOF are generally higher than those\n   \
    \   for an initial BOF.  In addition to the work done up through the\n      first\
    \ BOF, the first BOF will have highlighted the key areas where\n      additional\
    \ work is needed.  The time leading up to the second BOF\n      will need to be\
    \ spent working through those outstanding issues.\n      Second BOFs should not\
    \ be a repeat of the first BOF, with the same\n      issues being raised and the\
    \ same (unsatisfactory) responses\n      provided.  The second BOF needs to show\
    \ that all previously\n      identified issues have been resolved and that formation\
    \ of a WG is\n      now in order.\n"
- title: 6.  Pitfalls
  contents:
  - "6.  Pitfalls\n   Over the years, a number of pitfalls have been (repeatedly)\
    \ observed:\n   1) Waiting too long before getting started.  It is very difficult\
    \ to\n      prepare for a BOF on short notice.  Moreover, ADs are placed in a\n\
    \      no-win situation when asked to approve a BOF for which the\n      community\
    \ has not had a chance to participate.  Steps 1-4 in\n      Section 2 above are\
    \ designed to show the ADs that there is\n      community support for a particular\
    \ effort.  Short-circuiting those\n      steps forces an AD to make a judgment\
    \ call with (usually) too\n      little information.  Moreover, because the community\
    \ has not been\n      involved, it is much more likely that significant (and valid)\n\
    \      objections will be raised.  Often, those objections could have\n      been\
    \ dealt with in advance -- had there been sufficient time to\n      work through\
    \ them in advance.\n   2) Too much discussion/focus on solutions, rather than\
    \ showing that\n      support exists for the problem statement itself, and that\
    \ the\n      problem is well-understood and scoped.  The purpose of the BOF is\n\
    \      almost never to show that there are already proposed solutions,\n     \
    \ but to demonstrate that there is a real problem that needs\n      solving, a\
    \ solution would be beneficial to the community, it is\n      believed that a\
    \ solution is achievable, and there is a critical\n      mass of community support\
    \ to actually put in the real work of\n      developing a solution.\n   3) Asking\
    \ the wrong question during the BOF.  Often, BOF organizers\n      feel like they\
    \ need a \"show of hands\" on specific questions.  But,\n      unless a question\
    \ is clear, well scoped, focused enough to\n      establish where there is agreement\
    \ (and where not), etc., asking\n      such a question serves little purpose.\
    \  Even worse, asking poor\n      questions can frustrate the BOF participants\
    \ and lead to\n      additional questions at the microphone, derailing the focus\
    \ of the\n      BOF.\n      Examples of unreasonable questions to ask:\n     \
    \ - Asking folk to approve or review a charter that is put on screen\n       \
    \ but has not been posted to the mailing list sufficiently in\n        advance.\
    \  (You cannot ask folk to approve something they have\n        not seen.)\n \
    \     - Asking multi-part questions in which it is not clear (in\n        advance)\
    \ what all of the exact questions will be and which\n        choices a participant\
    \ needs to choose from.\n   4) Poorly advertised in advance, thus, the BOF itself\
    \ does not\n      include the \"right\" participants.  This can happen for a number\
    \ of\n      reasons, including:\n      - giving the BOF a \"cute\" but unintuitive\
    \ name (or acronym),\n        preventing people from realizing that it would be\
    \ of interest to\n        them.\n      - failing to advertise the BOF in advance\
    \ to the community of\n        people that might be interested.  At a minimum,\
    \ the existence of\n        a proposed BOF should be advertised on the IETF list\
    \ as well as\n        on specific WG lists that are somewhat related.\n   5) Providing\
    \ agenda time for the \"wrong\" presentations.  There is an\n      (unfortunate)\
    \ tendency to give anyone who requests agenda time an\n      opportunity to speak.\
    \  This is often a mistake.  Presentations\n      should be limited to those that\
    \ address the purpose of the BOF.\n      More important, presentations should\
    \ not distract from the BOF's\n      purpose, or open up ratholes that are a distraction\
    \ to the more\n      basic purpose of the BOF.  An example of problematic\n  \
    \    presentations:\n      - presentations on specific solutions, when the purpose\
    \ of the BOF\n        is to get agreement on the problem statement and the need\
    \ for a\n        WG.  Solutions at this point are too-often \"half-baked\" and\n\
    \        allow discussion to rathole on aspects of the solutions.\n        Instead,\
    \ the focus should be on getting agreement on whether to\n        form a WG.\n\
    \   6) Poor time management, leading to insufficient time for discussion\n   \
    \   of the key issues (this is often closely related to 5).  When\n      presentations\
    \ run over their allotted time, the end result is\n      either squeezing someone\
    \ else's presentation or having\n      insufficient discussion time.  Neither\
    \ is acceptable nor helpful.\n      BOF chairs need to give presenters just enough\
    \ time to make key\n      points -- and no more.  It may well be helpful to go\
    \ over a\n      presenter's slides in advance, to ensure they are on-topic and\n\
    \      will fit within the time slot.\n"

- title: 7.1.  Chairing
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Chairing\n   BOF organizers often assume that they will be chairing a BOF\
    \ (and the\n   eventual WG).  Neither assumption is always true.  ADs need to\
    \ ensure\n   that a BOF runs smoothly and is productive.  For some topics, it\
    \ is a\n   given that the BOF will be contentious.  In such cases, ADs may want\n\
    \   to have a more experienced person chairing or co-chairing the BOF.\n   Also,\
    \ those interested in organizing the BOF often are the most\n   interested in\
    \ driving a particular technology (and may have strongly\n   held views about\
    \ what direction an effort should take).  Working\n   Groups are often more effective\
    \ when passionately involved parties\n   are allowed to focus on the technical\
    \ work, rather than on managing\n   the WG itself.  Thus, do not be surprised\
    \ (or offended!) if the AD\n   wants to pick one or more co-chairs for either\
    \ the BOF or a follow-on\n   WG.\n"
- title: 7.2.  On the Need for a BOF
  contents:
  - "7.2.  On the Need for a BOF\n   This document highlights the need for allowing\
    \ for and actively\n   engaging in a broad public discussion on the merits of\
    \ forming a WG.\n   It might surprise some, but there is no actual process requirement\
    \ to\n   have a BOF prior to forming a WG.  The actual process requirement is\n\
    \   simply that the IESG (together with the AD(s) sponsoring the work)\n   approve\
    \ a formal charter as described in [RFC2418].  In practice,\n   BOFs are used\
    \ to engage the broader community on proposed work and to\n   help produce an\
    \ acceptable charter.\n   There are two observations that can be made here.  First,\
    \ BOFs are\n   often held not because they are (strictly speaking) required, but\n\
    \   because it is assumed they are needed or because ADs feel that a BOF\n   would\
    \ be beneficial in terms of getting additional public\n   participation.  Hence,\
    \ those interested in forming a WG should give\n   serious consideration to using\
    \ the steps outlined above not just for\n   the purposes of creating a BOF, but\
    \ to convince the IESG and the\n   broader community that a BOF is not even needed,\
    \ as there is already\n   demonstrated, strong consensus that a WG should be formed.\
    \  Second,\n   the IESG should not forget that BOFs are simply a tool, and may\
    \ not\n   even be the best tool in every situation.\n"
