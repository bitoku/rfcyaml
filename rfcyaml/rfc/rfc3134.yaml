- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This document provides terminology for benchmarking ATM based\n\
    \   switching devices supporting ABR.  It extends terminology already\n   defined\
    \ for benchmarking network interconnect devices in RFC's 1242,\n   2285, and 2544\
    \ and 2761.  Although some of the definitions in this\n   memo may be applicable\
    \ to a broader group of network interconnect\n   devices, the primary focus of\
    \ the terminology in this memo is on ATM\n   ABR.\n   This memo contains two major\
    \ sections: Background and Definitions.\n   The background section provides the\
    \ reader with an overview of the\n   technology and IETF formalisms.  The definitions\
    \ section is split\n   into two sub-sections.  The formal definitions sub-section\
    \ is\n   provided as a courtesy to the reader.  The measurement definitions\n\
    \   sub-section contains performance metrics with inherent units.\n   This document\
    \ assumes that necessary services are available and\n   active.  For example,\
    \ IP connectivity requires SSCOP connectivity\n   between signaling entities.\
    \  Further, it is assumed that the SUT has\n   the ability to configure ATM addresses\
    \ (via hard coded addresses,\n   ILMI or PNNI neighbor discovery), has the ability\
    \ to run SSCOP, and\n   has the ability to perform signaled call setups (via UNI\
    \ or PNNI\n   signaling).  Finally, this document presents only the terminology\n\
    \   associated with benchmarking IP performance over ATM; therefore, it\n   does\
    \ not represent a total compilation of ATM test terminology.\n   The BMWG produces\
    \ two major classes of documents: Benchmarking\n   Terminology documents and Benchmarking\
    \ Methodology documents.  The\n   Terminology documents present the benchmarks\
    \ and other related terms.\n   The Methodology documents define the procedures\
    \ required to collect\n   the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology\
    \ documents.\n"

  - "2. Existing Definitions.\n   RFC 1242, \"Benchmarking Terminology for Network\
    \ Interconnect\n   Devices\", should be consulted before attempting to make use\
    \ of this\n   document.  RFC 2544, \"Benchmarking Methodology for Network\n  \
    \ Interconnect Devices\", contains discussions of a number of terms\n   relevant\
    \ to the benchmarking of switching devices and should be\n   consulted.  RFC 2285,\
    \ \"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching\n   Devices\", contains a number\
    \ of terms pertaining to traffic\n   distributions and datagram interarrival.\
    \  RFC 2761, \"Terminology for\n   ATM Benchmarking\", contains a number terms\
    \ pertaining to traffic\n   management [TM4.0, TM4.1].  Many of the metrics defined\
    \ in RFC 2761\n   (e.g., CDV, CER, CLR, CMR, and CTD) also apply to ABR performance\n\
    \   benchmarking.  These metrics will not be redefined in this document.\n   For\
    \ the sake of clarity and continuity, this RFC adopts the template\n   for definitions\
    \ set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.\n"

    \ rate increase request.\n   Discussion: During the ARIRT, the SUT will not fully\

    \ transfer delay (RM-CTD) of RM-\n   cells associated with a given traffic load,\

    \ = max (RM-\n   CTD) - min (RM-CTD) where max and min indicate the maximum and\n\
    \   minimum over the integration period, respectively.\n   Discussion:  RM-CDV\
    \ is a component of RM-cell transfer delay, induced\n   by buffering and RM-cell\
    \ scheduling.\n   RM-CDV effects the time required to notify the source of a change\
    \ in\n   the condition of the network.  This in turn effects TCP round trip\n\
    \   time calculations. Large values of RM-CDV will adversely effect TCP\n   throughput\
