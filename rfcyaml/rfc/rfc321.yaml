  - "                    CBI Networking Activity at MITRE\n     This RFC is in response\
    \ to Tom O'Sullivan's probe for comments\non Computer Based Instruction. MITRE\
    \ is currently doing some pre-\nliminary work in the area,at the present time\
    \ limited to use of CAI-\nrelated network resources.\n     The most expedient\
    \ way for me to respond is by attaching excerpts\ntaken from a recent status report\
    \ prepared for internal MITRE use,\nintended for staff not generally familiar\
    \ with the ARPANET. Comments\ndirected at specific items in Tom's attachment will\
    \ follow in a future\n     We welcome comments on our activities and would like\
    \ to partici-\npate in any CBI dialogs that take place.\n1.0  OBJECTIVES\n   \
    \  MITRE/Washington became a node in the ARPA computer network in\nSeptember 1971\
    \ when a Terminal Interface Message Processor (TIP) was\ninstalled. Since that\
    \ time MITRE's use of the network has largely\nbeen supported by IR&D funds. The\
    \ objectives of the IR&D Network\nStudies are:\n     (a)  to promote the use of\
    \ the network resources in an\n          operational mode within MITRE to increase\
    \ the computer\n          capabilities available for supporting sponsor's work;\n\
    \     (b)  to use the ARPANET itself as a research tool for\n          conducting\
    \ computer networking experiments; and\n     (c)  to demonstrate the use of ARPANET\
    \ resources to extend\n          the capabilities of existing systems.\n     Specifically,\
    \ the proposed objectives are:\n     (1)  to select ARPANET resources that can\
    \ be used to support\n          identified MITRE projects and to demonstrate how\
    \ these\n          resources can be used;\n          sharing experiments to study\
    \ techniques for data handling\n          on a computer network; and\n     (3)\
    \  to demonstrate the feasibility of using remote\n          resources on the\
    \ ARPANET to augment the capabilities\n          of the TICCIT* system.\n*The\
    \ principle use of the TICCIT (Time-Shared Interactive Computer\n Controlled Information\
    \ Television) system has been for Computer\n Assisted Instruction (CAI). A TICCIT/CAI\
    \ system is currently being\n developed by MITRE under a National Science Foundation\
    \ (NSF) grant.\n     The IR&D Network Studies and Experiments project requires\
    \ soft-\nware development on selected ARPANET Host computers and extensive\nexercising\
    \ of network resources. The approach taken to fulfill the\nproject objectives\
    \ involves effort in three areas.\n     Task area I is designed to build up ARPANET\
    \ usage by MITRE.\nTask II involves conducting data sharing experiments on the\
    \ network\nutilizing software being built by MITRE at several network sites.\n\
    Task III is intended to demonstrate the use of CAI-related network\nresources\
    \ to augment the TICCIT/CAI system.\n     The specific activities involved in\
    \ each task area are discussed\nbelow.\n2.3  Task III - Demonstrate Extensions\
    \ to TICCIT System Capabilities\n     ---------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \     That Are Possibly by Drawing on ARPANET Resources\n     -------------------------------------------------\n\
    \     The structure of the ARPANET is such that it is technically\npossible to\
    \ combine resources on the network to form a \"distributed\nsystem.\" A first\
    \ step in this direction would be to use network\nresources to augment a special-purpose\
    \ system connected at one of the\nnodes. The special-purpose system would serve\
    \ as the vertex of the\ndistributed system, dynamically drawing on network resources\
    \ to\nperform specific functions.\nfeasibility of the concept of a distributed\
    \ system. However, rather\nthan initially connecting TICCIT to the network, resources\
    \ on the\nnetwork will first be used to demonstrate how they could augment the\n\
    capabilities of TICCIT\n     Task III is organized as three subtasks to demonstrate\
    \ that the\nrange of curriculum material can be extended, to demonstrate that\
    \ the\nTICCIT/CAI system can be supplemented with specialized CAI systems\nthat\
    \ use AI techniques, and to demonstrate that TICCIT system resources\nand capabilities\
    \ can be augmented by using computing and storage\nresources available on the\
    \ network.\n     (a)  Demonstrate that the range of curriculum\n          material\
    \ can be extended.\nThe range of curriculum material offered by the TICCIT/CAI\
    \ system can\nbe extended by using network resources.  Two areas that were selected\n\
    for the demonstration are mathematics and computer science.\n     The Culler-Fried\
    \ On-Line Graphics-Oriented system available on\nthe IBM 360/75 at the University\
    \ of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB)\nwas selected for use in mathematics courses.\
    \  A collection of diverse\nsystems and languages will be selected to demonstrate\
    \ how they can be\nincorporated in a computer science curriculum.\n     The following\
    \ tasks are necessary for demonstrating that the\nrange of curriculum material\
    \ can be extended:\n     *  learn the use and structure of the Culler Fried system.\n\
    \     *  use the Culler-Fried system over the network using an\n     *  design\
    \ sample courses for demonstration of the use of\n        the Culler-Fried system\
    \ in a mathematics curriculum.\n     *  develop software to incorporate the use\
    \ of the Culler-\n        Fried system in the sample courses and demonstrate.\n\
    \     *  prepare a sample computer science curriculum and demonstrate\n      \
    \  how the wide range of systems on the network can be utilized\n        in a\
    \ typical computer science curriculum.\n     *  determine and document the technical\
    \ specifications required\n        for a TICCIT/CAI system interface.\n     (b)\
    \  Demonstrate that the TICCIT/CAI system can be supplemented\n          with\
    \ specialized CAI systems that use AI techniques.\nThere are two network resources\
    \ utilizing AI techniques that have been\napplied to computer assisted instruction\
    \ tasks: SCHOLAR and LOGO.\nSCHOLAR is a mixed-initiative rather than a frame-oriented\
    \ CAI system.\nLOGO is a LISP-based programming language designed to study whether\n\
    notions and skills of formal reasoning and problem-solving can be\ntaught. We\
    \ will investigate if these systems can be used to supple-\nment the TICCIT system\
    \ and, if possible, will demonstrate their use.\n     The following tasks are\
    \ required:\n     *  investigate the use of SCHOLAR on the TENEX system\n    \
    \    at BBN over the network.\n     *  investigate the use of LOGO and the \"\
    turtle\" over the\n        network from the PDP-10 at MIT/AI and/or from TENEX\
    \ at BBN.\n     *  demonstrate the use of the systems over the network.\n    \
    \    with the TICCIT system.\n     (c)  Demonstrate that TICCIT system resources\
    \ and capabilities\n          can be augmented by using computing and storage\
    \ resources\n          available on the network.\nIt should be possible for the\
    \ TICCIT/CAI system to substantially in-\ncrease its capacity by using large data\
    \ storage devices on the ARPANET\nfor storing student records and curriculum and\
    \ by using some Host\ncomputer to run complex statistical analysis programs to\
    \ analyze and\nevaluate student progress and course content.\n     In order to\
    \ demonstrate that such a scheme is possible, the\nfollowing tasks are necessary:\n\
    \     *  determine format and requirements for curriculum\n        material and\
    \ student records.\n     *  develop a method to store and retrieve data on a\n\
    \        demand basis.\n     *  select a Host on the network and develop software\n\
    \        for a demonstration.\n     *  determine and document requirements for\
    \ an interface\n        with the TICCIT system.\n3.0  PROGRESS OF WORK\n     In\
    \ this section the progress of the work associated with each\ntask is presented.\
    \  Both achievements and problems encountered are\ndiscussed.  The manpower expended\
    \ thus far for each subtask is given\nin graphic form, together with a proposed\
    \ schedule for completing\n3.3  Task III - Demonstrate Extensions to TICCIT System\
    \ Capabilities\n     ---------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \     That Are Possible by Drawing on ARPANET Resources\n     -------------------------------------------------\n\
    \     Many of the resources on the ARPANET were designed as stand\nalone systems\
    \ not intended for use over the network nor for facile\ninterfacing with other\
    \ systems.  Thus we have found that more work\nthan initially was estimated is\
    \ needed to use the selected CAI-related\nsystems over the network.  Therefore\
    \ we plan to fulfill the goals of\neach subtask by demonstrating the use of selected\
    \ resources over the\nnetwork but will not attempt to interconnect the systems\
    \ in any\nfashion during FY1972.  A proposal to investigate the notion of a\n\
    distributed CAI system using ARPANET resources is under preparation.\n     The\
    \ status of our progress in using CAI-related resources over\nthe network is presented\
    \ below.\n     (a)  Demonstrate that the range of curriculum material\n      \
    \    can be extended.\nThe Culler-Fried (C-F) On-Line Graphics-Oriented system\
    \ at UCSB was\nselected to demonstrate its use in mathematics curriculum.  The\
    \ system\nhas been used successfully in a variety of courses at UCSB, including\n\
    chemistry, mathematics, and economics(30,31,32,33,35).\n     The Culler-Fried\
    \ system's normal mode of operation is with two\nkeyboards and a Tektronics graphics\
    \ display device. The keys on the\nsecond keyboard are \"function\" keys; for\
    \ example, by pressing a single\nkey the user can initiate complex actions such\
    \ as displaying a plot\nonline access to the 360/75 system to remotely control\
    \ the execution\nof programs. The latter service is currently available on the\
    \ network\nthrough TELNET. Access to the system was made possible by defining\
    \ a\nmapping from ASCII characters (sent as the \"network virtual terminal\")\n\
    to characters expected by the OLS. Thus it is often necessary to type\na sequence\
    \ of characters on a TTY-type device to invoke the action of\na single function\
    \ key. Under the current implementation, graphics\noutput to the network is suppressed.\n\
    \     We plan to demonstrate the use of the C-F system on an IMLAC\ngraphics device\
    \ attached to our TIP. During the first phase of our\nimplementation, we will\
    \ not simulate the C-F function keyboard but\nwill enter our graphics input using\
    \ the procedures defined for use\nvia TELNET. For output, UCSB agreed to provide\
    \ a new output processor\nwhich will no longer suppress graphics output, but will\
    \ map it into\nthe remote graphics capabilities as provided by IMLAC (Figure 3).\n\
    Such a system was implemented in early February but due to the\ncharacter-oriented\
    \ nature of the IMLAC device available to us, the\nresolution was unsatisfactory.\
    \ We have now defined a low-level\ngraphics protocol.  UCSB has agreed to send\
    \ graphics output to us\nusing this protocol.  We have had to program new processes\
    \ for the\nIMLAC and are now debugging the new programs.  Due to the limited\n\
    core available on the particular IMLAC that we are using (4K 16 bit\nwords) which\
    \ limits the size of internal display lists, we will not\ndeveloped is general\
    \ and can be moved to an IMLAC with larger core\ncapacity.  We currently send\
    \ alphanumeric input from a TTY or 3300\nand divert the graphics output to the\
    \ IMLAC.\n     When we can access the Culler-Fried system for graphics output\n\
    successfully via the network, we plan to modify the IMLAC programs to\npermit\
    \ alpha input from the IMLAC keyboard.  We also plan to investi-\ngate the possibility\
    \ of attaching a function keyboard to the IMLAC.\nLastly, we intend to investigate\
    \ the use of TICCIT display devices\nwith the TIP.  A sample mathematics course\
    \ will be designed to assist\nin demonstration of the CAI applications of the\
    \ Culler-Fried system.\nWe are currently studying the past uses of the system\
    \ in a CAI mode.\n     We have not yet investigated computer science curriculums.\
    \  We\nplan to get inputs from the ACM Committee on Computer Science Educa-\n\
    tion(36,37) and to visit universities in the Washington area.  This\nactivity\
    \ is scheduled to commence in April.\n     (b)  Demonstrate that the TICCIT/CAI\
    \ system can be supplemented\n          with specialized CAI systems that use\
    \ AI techniques.\nThe two network resources selected for demonstration are SCHOLAR\
    \ and\nLOGO.  Both systems are implemented in LISP and are currently avail-\n\
    able over the network on the TENEX system at BBN.  A version of LOGO\nwith a \"\
    display turtle\" is available on the PDP-10 at MIT/AI, however,\nthey do not yet\
    \ have their NCP implemented and thus are not currently\naccessible over the network.\
    \ There is also a version of LOGO on the\nTENEX system at SRI/AI. They also are\
    \ not currently connected to the\n     We used SCHOLAR over the network in January\
    \ with a data base\nprovided by BBN to review the knowledge of a student in the\
    \ geography\nof South America(38,39).\n     The LOGO system at MIT/AI is perhaps\
    \ the most impressive system\nfor use in a demonstration due to the availability\
    \ of a \"display\nturtle\". The system is currently being used remotely by the\
    \ Bridge\nSchool in Lexington, Massachusetts. We visited the school and observed\n\
    a class in session. We also attended an undergraduate class in Applied\nMath at\
    \ MIT that was learning turtle geometry.\n     Seymour Papert of MIT expects the\
    \ MIT/AI PDP-10 to be up on the\nnetwork by the middle of April(40). He has agreed\
    \ to modify his system\nto interface with our IMLAC via the network using the\
    \ low-level graphics\nprotocol that we specified. He has developed many courses\
    \ and games\nusing LOGO(41,42,43,44,45) that provide sufficient material for use\n\
    in demonstrating the system. A real turtle may be available in early\nsummer to\
    \ run from our TIP.\n     We have used the LOGO system at BBN via the network.\
    \ Since the\nsystem is continually being modified, Dr. Feurzeig agreed to put\
    \ a\nclean version on the RAND TENEX for our use. BBN's LOGO does not\ncurrently\
    \ have a display turtle, however, they are willing to imple-\nment one. Even without\
    \ the display turtle, courseware that has been\ndeveloped for teaching mathematics\
    \ provides sufficient material for\nus to work from(46,47). A radio controlled\
    \ turtle has been designed\nbuilt at MITRE to run from our TIP.\n     (c)  Demonstrate\
    \ that TICCIT system resources and capabilities\n          can be augmented by\
    \ using computing and storage resources\n          available on the network.\n\
    Work has not begun on this subtask.  However, much of the software\ndeveloped\
    \ for the data sharing experiments can be used to store and\nretrieve data on\
    \ a demand basis.\n     We have received preliminary curriculum material from\
    \ TICCIT\npersonnel. We expect to interact with them to determine more speci-\n\
    fically the format and requirements for curriculum material and student\nrecords.\n\
