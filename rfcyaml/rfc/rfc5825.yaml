  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension\
    \ document\n   set [RFC4952] [RFC5336] [RFC5335] [RFC5337] expands Email address\n\
    \   structure, syntax, and email header format.  To avoid rejection of\n   internationalized\
    \ email messages, the downgrading mechanism [RFC5504]\n   converts an internationalized\
    \ message to a traditional email message\n   when a server in the delivery path\
    \ does not support the UTF8SMTP\n   extension.  The downgraded message is a traditional\
    \ email message,\n   except the message has \"Downgraded-\" header fields.\n \
    \  A perfect reverse-function of the downgrading does not exist because\n   the\
    \ encoding defined in [RFC2047] is not exactly reversible and\n   \"Received\"\
    \ header field downgrading may remove FOR clause\n   information.  The restoration\
    \ of the downgrading should be done once\n   at the final destination of the downgraded\
    \ message such as Mail User\n   Agents (MUAs) or IMAP servers.  This document\
    \ describes the\n   restoration methods for displaying downgraded messages in\
    \ MUAs.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n   Specialized terms used in this specification are defined\
    \ in the EAI\n   overview [RFC4952] or in [RFC5321], [RFC5322], or the MIME documents\n\
    \   [RFC2045], [RFC2047], [RFC2183], and [RFC2231].\n   This document depends\
    \ on [RFC5335] and [RFC5504].  Key words used in\n   those documents are used\
    \ in this document, too.\n   The term \"MIME decode\" is used for both \"encoded-word\"\
    \ decoding\n   defined by [RFC2047] and MIME parameter value decoding defined\
    \ by\n   [RFC2231].\n"

- title: 3.1.  Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Considerations\n   The order of some header fields (such as \"Resent-*\"\
    \ fields) is\n   significant.  The process of regenerating the original fields\
    \ from\n   the downgraded ones MUST NOT reorder the fields.\n   In order to regenerate\
    \ a field from a specific downgraded header\n   field, it's necessary to find\
    \ the corresponding replacement in the\n   current message.  If the corresponding\
    \ field cannot be found, the\n   downgraded header field in question cannot be\
    \ regenerated and used.\n   In any case where reconstruction of a particular downgraded\
    \ header\n   field fails, both header fields (the \"downgraded-YYY\" header field\n\
    \   and the \"YYY\" header field) SHOULD be left in the message as they\n   are.\
    \  The MUA MAY choose to communicate the situation to the user\n   (see the \"\
    Security Considerations\" section).\n"
- title: 3.2.  The Process
  contents:
  - "3.2.  The Process\n   A MUA MAY decode and regenerate the original header fields\
    \ of the\n   message (Mail Transport Agents (MTAs) and Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs)\n\
    \   SHOULD NOT attempt to do this; it SHOULD be left to the MUA).  This\n   procedure\
    \ can be used to approximately reverse the downgrade process,\n   but it will\
    \ not always construct the original header fields exactly.\n   Three types of\
    \ downgraded header fields are described in Section 3 of\n   [RFC5504]:\n   1.\
    \  \"Envelope Information Preservation Header Fields\", described in\n       RFC5504\
    \ Section 3.1 and in Section 3.2.1, below.\n   2.  \"Address Header Fields' Preservation\
    \ Header Fields\", described in\n       RFC5504 Section 3.2 and in Section 3.2.2,\
    \ below.\n   3.  \"Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields\", described\
    \ in\n       RFC5504 Section 3.3 and in Section 3.2.3, below.\n   After processing\
    \ downgraded header fields, decode all header fields,\n   as described in [RFC2047]\
    \ and [RFC2231].\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  No Reconstruction of the Envelope Information Preservation
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  No Reconstruction of the Envelope Information Preservation\n        Header\
    \ Fields\n   Envelope information preservation header fields are new fields that\n\
    \   might have been added by the downgrade process.  Because they do not\n   represent\
    \ fields that appeared in the original message, this process\n   is not applicable\
    \ to them.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Reconstructing the Address Header Fields' Preservation Header
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Reconstructing the Address Header Fields' Preservation Header\n     \
    \   Fields\n   Reconstructing address header fields' preservation header fields\
    \ is\n   OPTIONAL, and a decision MAY be made on each field, individually.  In\n\
    \   particular, it might be less important to process the \"Resent-*\"\n   header\
    \ fields, so an implementation MAY choose to skip those.\n   To construct a displayable\
    \ copy of a header field from one of these\n   downgraded header fields, follow\
    \ this procedure:\n   1.  In an edit buffer, create a new header field:\n    \
    \   (a)  For the field name, remove the \"Downgraded-\" prefix from the\n    \
    \        downgraded field name.  For example, \"Downgraded-From\"\n          \
    \  becomes \"From\", and \"Downgraded-Resent-To\" becomes\n            \"Resent-To\"\
    .\n       (b)  For the field value, decode the MIME-encoded value of the\n   \
    \         downgraded field according to [RFC2047].\n   2.  Apply \"Email Header\
    \ Fields Downgrading\", defined in Section 5 of\n       [RFC5504], to the field\
    \ in the edit buffer.  The process\n       generates two header fields, one is\
    \ ASCII header field and the\n       other is the Address Header Fields' Preservation\
    \ Header Field.\n       Put the generated ASCII header field into comparison buffer\
    \ 1.\n   3.  Canonicalize the header field in the comparison buffer 1:\n     \
    \  1.  Unfold all header field continuation lines as described in\n          \
    \ [RFC5322].\n       2.  Ensure that there is one space character before and one\
    \ after\n           the <mailbox-list> separator \",\".  If a space character\
    \ is\n           missing, insert one.\n       3.  Ensure that there is one space\
    \ character before and one after\n           each <comment>.  If a space character\
    \ is missing, insert one.\n       4.  Decode each <encoded-word> whose charset\
    \ is \"UTF-8\".\n       5.  Convert all sequences of one or more WSP characters\
    \ to a\n           single space character.  WSP characters here include those\n\
    \           before and after a line-folding boundary.\n       6.  Delete all WSP\
    \ characters at the end of each unfolded header\n           field value.\n   \
    \    7.  Delete any WSP characters remaining before and after the\n          \
    \ colon separating the header field name from the header field\n           value,\
    \ retaining the colon separator.\n   4.  Locate the first instance of the corresponding\
    \ field in the\n       message's headers.\n   5.  Canonicalize the located field\
    \ as in step 3, and put the result\n       into comparison buffer 2.\n   6.  Compare\
    \ the header field in comparison buffer 1 with the header\n       field in comparison\
    \ buffer 2.  If they match, go to step 8.\n   7.  Locate the next instance of\
    \ the corresponding field in the\n       message's headers.  If one is found,\
    \ go to step 5.  If none is\n       found, stop: you cannot use this downgraded\
    \ field because you\n       can't find its replacement in the message.\n   8.\
    \  Replace the located header field with the one in the edit buffer.\n       You\
    \ MUST NOT reorder the header fields when you do this; it's\n       important\
    \ to replace the field in the same place.  Remove the\n       target downgraded\
    \ header field in the message header.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  The Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  The Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields\n   The unknown\
    \ header fields' preservation header fields SHOULD be left\n   as they are unless\
    \ the MUA has special knowledge of a particular\n   field.  An MUA with such knowledge\
    \ MAY use the procedure similar to\n   the procedure in Section 3.2.2, above,\
    \ for those fields about which\n   it knows.  (Note that the whitespace canonicalization\
    \ rule might not\n   be applicable to some header fields.)\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   While information in any email header should\
    \ usually be treated with\n   some suspicion, current email systems commonly employ\
    \ various\n   mechanisms and protocols to make the information more trustworthy.\n\
    \   For example, an organization's boundary MTA can modify \"From\" lines\n  \
    \ so that messages arriving from outside the organization are easily\n   distinguishable\
    \ from internal emails.  As a result of that rewriting,\n   the \"From\" header\
    \ field might not match the \"Downgraded-From\" header\n   field.\n   A MUA MAY\
    \ emphasize bogus or broken address header fields'\n   preservation header fields\
    \ found in step 7 of Section 3.2.2.\n   Hiding the information from the actual\
    \ header fields when using the\n   \"Downgraded-\" header fields does not cause\
    \ loss of information if\n   generating MIME-decoded header fields in step 1 of\
    \ Section 3.2.2 and\n   the comparison done in step 7 are successful.  To ensure\
    \ that no\n   information is lost, a MUA SHOULD have a function that uses the\n\
    \   actual message that was received (with/without MIME decoding) to\n   render\
    \ the message.\n   We have focused, here, on issues with displaying downgraded\
    \ messages.\n   For more discussion of downgraded and internationalized messages\
    \ in\n   general, see the \"Security Considerations\" section in [RFC5504] and\n\
    \   [RFC4952].\n"
