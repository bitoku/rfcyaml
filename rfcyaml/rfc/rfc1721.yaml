  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo provides information for the Internet community.\
    \  This memo\n   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution\
    \ of\n   this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   As required by Routing Protocol Criteria (RFC 1264), this report\n\
    \   documents the key features of the RIP-2 protocol and the current\n   implementation\
    \ experience.  This report is a prerequisite to\n   advancing RIP-2 on the standards\
    \ track.\n"
- title: Acknowledgements
  contents:
  - "Acknowledgements\n   The RIP-2 protocol owes much to those who participated in\
    \ the RIP-2\n   working group.  A special thanks goes to Fred Baker, for his help\
    \ on\n   the MIB, and to Jeffrey Honig, for all his comments.\n"
- title: 1.  Protocol Documents
  contents:
  - "1.  Protocol Documents\n   The RIP-2 applicability statement is defined in RFC\
    \ 1722 [1].\n   The RIP-2 protocol description is defined in RFC 1723 [2].  This\
    \ memo\n   obsoletes RFC 1388, which specifies an update to the \"Routing\n  \
    \ Information Protocol\" RFC 1058 (STD 34).\n   The RIP-2 MIB description is defined\
    \ in RFC 1724 [3].  This memo\n   obsoletes RFC 1389.\n"
- title: 2.  Key Features
  contents:
  - "2.  Key Features\n   While RIP-2 shares the same basic algorithms as RIP-1, it\
    \ supports\n   several new features.  They are: external route tags, subnet masks,\n\
    \   next hop addresses, and authentication.\n   The significant change from RFC\
    \ 1388 is the removal of the domain\n   field.  There was no clear agreement as\
    \ to how the field would be\n   used, so it was determined to leave the field\
    \ reserved for future\n   expansion.\n"
- title: 2.1  External Route Tags
  contents:
  - "2.1  External Route Tags\n   The route tag field may be used to propagate information\
    \ acquired\n   from an EGP.  The definition of the contents of this field are\
    \ beyond\n   the scope of this protocol.  However, it may be used, for example,\
    \ to\n   propagate an EGP AS number.\n"
- title: 2.2  Subnet Masks
  contents:
  - "2.2  Subnet Masks\n   Inclusion of subnet masks was the original intent of opening\
    \ the RIP\n   protocol for improvement.  Subnet mask information makes RIP more\n\
    \   useful in a variety of environments and allows the use of variable\n   subnet\
    \ masks on the network.  Subnet masks are also necessary for\n   implementation\
    \ of \"classless\" addressing, as the CIDR work proposes.\n"
- title: 2.3  Next Hop Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.3  Next Hop Addresses\n   Support for next hop addresses allows for optimization\
    \ of routes in\n   an environment which uses multiple routing protocols.  For\
    \ example,\n   if RIP-2 were being run on a network along with another IGP, and\
    \ one\n   router ran both protocols, then that router could indicate to the\n\
    \   other RIP-2 routers that a better next hop than itself exists for a\n   given\
    \ destination.\n"
- title: 2.4  Authentication
  contents:
  - "2.4  Authentication\n   One significant improvement RIP-2 offers over RIP-1,\
    \ is the addition\n   of an authentication mechanism.  Essentially, it is the\
    \ same\n   extensible mechanism provided by OSPF.  Currently, only a plain-text\n\
    \   password is defined for authentication.  However, more sophisticated\n   authentication\
    \ schemes can easily be incorporated as they are\n   defined.\n"
- title: 2.5  Multicasting
  contents:
  - "2.5  Multicasting\n   RIP-2 packets may be multicast instead of being broadcast.\
    \  The use\n   of an IP multicast address reduces the load on hosts which do not\n\
    \   support routing protocols.  It also allows RIP-2 routers to share\n   information\
    \ which RIP-1 routers cannot hear.  This is useful since a\n   RIP-1 router may\
    \ misinterpret route information because it cannot\n   apply the supplied subnet\
    \ mask.\n"
- title: 3.  RIP-2 MIB
  contents:
  - "3.  RIP-2 MIB\n   The MIB for RIP-2 allows for monitoring and control of RIP's\n\
    \   operation within the router.  In addition to global and per-interface\n  \
    \ counters and controls, there are per-peer counters which provide the\n   status\
    \ of RIP-2 \"neighbors\".\n   The MIB was modified to deprecate the domain, which\
    \ was removed from\n   the protocol.  It has also been converted into version\
    \ 2 format.\n"
- title: 4.  Implementations
  contents:
  - "4.  Implementations\n   Currently, there are three complete implementations of\
    \ RIP-2: GATED,\n   written by Jeffrey Honig at Cornell University; Xylogics's\
    \ Annex\n   Communication server; and an implementation for NOS, written by Jeff\n\
    \   White.  The GATED implementation is available by anonymous FTP from\n   gated.cornell.edu\
    \ as pub/gated/gated-alpha.tar.Z.  The implementation\n   for NOS is available\
    \ by anonymous FTP from ucsd.edu as\n   /hamradio/packet/tcpip/incoming/rip2.zip.\n\
    \   Additionally, Midnight Networks has produced a test suite which\n   verifies\
    \ an implementation's conformance to RFC 1388 implemented over\n   RFC 1058.\n\
    \   The author has conducted interoperability testing between the GATED\n   and\
    \ Xylogics implementations and found no incompatibilities.  This\n   testing includes\
    \ verification of protection provided by the\n   authentication mechanism described\
    \ in section 2.4.\n"
- title: 5.  Operational experience
  contents:
  - "5.  Operational experience\n   Xylogics has been running RIP-2 on its production\
    \ systems for five\n   months.  The topology includes seven subnets in a class\
    \ B address and\n   various, unregistered class C addresses used for dial-up access.\
    \  Six\n   systems, in conjunction with three routers from other vendors and\n\
    \   dozens of host systems, operate on those subnets.\n   The only problem which\
    \ has appeared is the reaction of some routers\n   to Version 2 RIP packets. \
    \ Contrary to RFC 1058, these routers\n   discard Version 2 packets rather than\
    \ ignoring the fields not defined\n   for Version 1.\n"
