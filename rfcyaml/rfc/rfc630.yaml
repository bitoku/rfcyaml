  - "          FTP Error Code Usage for More Reliable Mail Service\n    A major hindrance\
    \ to providing reliable mail service is the lack of\nwell-defined FTP error replies\
    \ that would enable a mailing process to\ndecide how to handle a failure.  New\
    \ FTP error codes are currently in\nthe design stage, and a proposal will be announced\
    \ soon.  In the\ninterim, we can get some improvement by simply defining how we\
    \ intend to\nuse the current FTP codes.  The purpose of this RFC is to inform\
    \ all\nsites of how TENEX sites will use and interpret the codes starting in\n\
    the near future.\n                        CURRENT CODE DEFINITIONS\n    The FTP\
    \ error codes defined for failure to perform a file action\n(including mail) are:\n\
    450 File not found\n451 File access denied to you\n452 Data connection closed\n\
    453 Insufficient storage\n454 Cannot connect to your data socket\n450, 451, and\
    \ 453 are applicable to both the MAIL and MLFL commands,\nwhile 452 and 454 are\
    \ only meaningful for MLFL.\n                   SHORTCOMING OF CURRENT DEFINITIONS\n\
    \    There are more possible causes of failure to deliver mail than the\nones\
    \ defined above.  Implementors of FTP servers thus had to make\narbitrary assignments\
    \ of error conditions to defined codes.  As a\nresult, although the text of the\
    \ reply might distinguish these\nconditions for the benefit of human users, the\
    \ code doesn't distinguish\nthem for the benefit of processes.\n    The minimum\
    \ distinction needed by the TENEX mail-sending processes\nis between permanent\
    \ and non-permanent failures.  In the latter case,\nthe process will repeatedly\
    \ try to deliver the mail for several days.\n                     NEW DEFINITIONS\
    \ FOR TENEX USE\n    The following changes will be installed at TENEX sites over\
    \ the next\ncouple of months.\nFTP SERVER\n    The TENEX FTP server will continue\
    \ to use 452 and 454 as specified\nfor the MLFL command.\n    For MAIL and MLFL,\
    \ it will send the other codes as follows:\n450 Permanent failures due to the\
    \ user addressed in the Mail or MLFL\n    command.\n    Examples:  No such user;\
    \ No mailbox for that user; Can't access file\n    (because net users can't write\
    \ in that mailbox).\n451 Permanent failures due to the message itself.\n    Example:\
    \  Line sent over TELNET connection is too long (MAIL command\n    only).\n453\
    \ Temporary failures\n    Examples:  TELNET connection unexpectedly closed;  Mailbox\
    \ busy;\n    Unexpected local errors (such as failure to create scratch file).\n\
    MAILING PROCESSES\n    TENEX mailing processes currently interpret all the codes\
    \ 450-454 as\nmeaning permanent failure.  They will be changed to interpret 452,\
    \ 453,\nand 454 as temporary while leaving 450 and 451 permanent.\n          \
    \         COMPATIBILITY WITH NON-TENEX SITES\n    These interpretations should\
    \ not adversely affect the interaction of\nTENEX and non-TENEX mail processes,\
    \ since we are simply changing from\none arbitrary set of interpretations to another.\
    \  Moreover:\n--Our interpretation of 450-451 as permanent and 452-454 as temporary\
    \ is\nconsistent with their original meanings.\n--Our new choice of what codes\
    \ to use for what failure is no farther\nfrom the original meanings than our old\
    \ choice was, and conveys more\ninformation.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie\
