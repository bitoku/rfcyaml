  contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This RFC suggests a simple method for workstations to\
    \ dynamically\n   access mail from a mailbox server.  This RFC specifies a proposed\n\
    \   protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and\n  \
    \ suggestions for improvement.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The intent of the Post Office Protocol (POP) is to allow a user's\n\
    \   workstation to access mail from a mailbox server.  It is expected\n   that\
    \ mail will be posted from the workstation to the mailbox server\n   via the Simple\
    \ Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).  For further\n   information see RFC-821 [1]\
    \ and RFC-822 [2].\n   The status of this protocol is experimental, and this protocol\
    \ is\n   dependent upon TCP.\n"
- title: The Protocol
  contents:
  - "The Protocol\n   The protocol is for the server to be listening for a connection.\n\
    \   When a connection is opened the server sends a greeting message and\n   waits\
    \ for commands.  When commands are received the server acts on\n   them and responds\
    \ with replies.\n   The client opens a connection, waits for the greeting, then\
    \ sends the\n   USER and then the PASS commands to establish authorization to\
    \ access\n   mailboxes.  The client begins a mail reading transaction with either\n\
    \   an RDEL (to read and delete all messages from a mailbox) or a RETR\n   (to\
    \ simply read all messages from a mailbox).  The server opens and\n   locks the\
    \ mailbox, and responds with the number of characters in the\n   mailbox.  Then\
    \ the client asks for the data to be sent by issuing the\n   RCEV command.  The\
    \ server responds by sending the mail data.  When\n   all the data has been received\
    \ the client sends the RCVD command.  If\n   the transaction started with the\
    \ RDEL command the server now deletes\n   the mail data from the mailbox. In any\
    \ case, the server closes and\n   unlocks the mailbox.  The client terminates\
    \ the session with the QUIT\n   command.\n"

    \ Commands\n      USER name\n         This command identifies the user to the\
    \ server.  It must be\n         followed by the PASS command.\n            Possible\
    \ responses:  \"+OK\" or \"-ERR\"\n      PASS password\n         The PASS command\
    \ carries the password authenticating this user.\n         Together the USER name\
    \ and PASS password are used by the server\n         to control access to the\
    \ mailboxes.\n            Possible responses:  \"+OK\" or \"-ERR\"\n      RETR\
    \ mailbox\n         This command begins a mail reading transaction.  The RETR\n\
    \         command is used to read all the messages in a mailbox without\n    \
    \     deleting them.  It must be followed by the RCEV command.\n            Possible\
    \ responses:  \"#xxx\" or \"-ERR\"\n      RDEL mailbox\n         This command\
    \ begins a mail reading transaction.  The RDEL\n         command is used to read\
    \ all the messages in a mailbox and\n         delete them.  It must be followed\
    \ by the RCEV command.\n            Possible responses:  \"#xxx\" or \"-ERR\"\n\
    \      RCEV\n         This command confirms that the client is ready to receive\
    \ the\n         mail data.  It must be followed by the RCVD command.\n       \
    \     Possible responses:  \"+OK\" or (connection aborted)\n      RCVD\n     \
    \    This command confirms that the client has received and accepted\n       \
    \  the mail.  The RCVD command ends the mail reading transaction.\n         In\
    \ the case of the RDEL transaction, it is possible that the\n         mail is\
    \ not necessarily deleted.  This is indicated by an error\n         reply.\n \
    \           Possible responses:  \"+OK\" or \"-ERR\"\n"

    \    QUIT\n         This command indicates the client is done with the session.\n\
    \         The server sends an OK response and then closes the connection.\n  \
    \          Possible responses:  \"+OK\" then Close\n      NOOP\n         This\
    \ is the no operation command.  It causes no action on the\n         part of the\
    \ server except an OK response.\n            Possible response:  \"+OK\"\n   \
    \   RSET\n         This command causes the server to abort the current transaction\n\
    \         and return to waiting for a command (one of RDEL, RETR, QUIT,\n    \
    \     NOOP, or RSET).  When aborting a transaction the server must\n         take\
    \ care to properly close and unlock the mailbox.\n            Possible response:\
    \  \"+OK\"\n"
