    \ what the data management\n   working group should do.\n"
- title: Phase I

  - "Phase I\n   JOHN SENIOR, Univ. of Penn. and National Board of Medical Examiners,\n\
    \   Phila., PA., described the use of a network to provide access to\n   models\
    \ that simulate medical behavior of patients.  These models are\n   used primarily\
    \ for teaching and testing physicians.  The network\n   provides an interface\
    \ by which varieties of terminals can connect to\n   and access these models.\
    \  Other data bases exist to which access\n   through a network may be desirable;\
    \ however, these data bases have a\n   \"polyglot\" of organizations making it\
    \ presently impossible to use\n   foreign data bases.\n   HECTOR MAYNEZ, National\
    \ Library of Medicine, described the MEDLINE\n   system.  This has 1000 journals\
    \ on-line to which access can be made\n   via a network.  This network, as the\
    \ one above, provides the\n   interface for access by various terminals.  In this\
    \ network are four\n   or five computers with other applications such as CAI,\
    \ clinical\n   diagnosis, etc.\n   RAY BEVERIDGE, MITRE, presented the requirements\
    \ for the WWMCCS\n   (World Wide Military Command and Control System) Network.\
    \  This\n   network will contain 25 nodes and have a data exchange rate of the\n\
    \   order of 10,000,000 characters per day.  Three type of data were\n   formulated\
    \ - query data with response on the order of seconds, daily\n   exchange for updates\
    \ and reports, and other data for weekly, monthly\n   or as required reports.\n\
    \   ERICA PEREZ, MITRE, discussed data management for the WWMCCS Network.\n  \
    \ The two problems are determining the location of desired data, and\n   providing\
    \ the proper security and reliability for vital data.  The\n   location of data\
    \ bases will be indicated in directories which may\n   automatically determine\
    \ which segment is applicable to a query.  The\n   directory will contain lists\
    \ of data bases, files users and programs.\n   The directory can be centralized\
    \ (all at one location), distributed\n   (split into pieces but where each piece\
    \ resides at one location)\n   partially replicated (split into pieces but in\
    \ which certain parts\n   may be replicated at different locations) and completely\
    \ replicated\n   (the complete directory at all locations).\n   The data management\
    \ system will have to deal with possibly different\n   hardware systems and even\
    \ different local data managements systems.\n   One solution is to have a standard\
    \ data management and data\n   description language for transmission of requests\
    \ and data in the\n   network.\n   The system will have to provide capabilities\
    \ for file transfer,\n   queries, remote batch, and for user communication via\
    \ a mail box.\n   The security of the data is maintained by checking user id,\
    \ terminal\n   authorization, process authorization and data authorization.\n\
    \   BOB BROWN, General Motors Research Lab., described the network of\n   computers\
    \ at the General Motors Research Center.  This network at\n   present consists\
    \ of an IBM 360/67, a 360/65, a 370/165, three 1800's\n   and a Sigma 5.  All\
    \ of these are primarily for graphics use except\n   the 67 and the 165.  An example\
    \ of how data passes through the\n   network was given.  The styling department\
    \ develops a design on an\n   1800.  Data on this design is sent to the 67 for\
    \ stress and shape\n   analysis and the results returned to the 1800.  After a\
    \ design is\n   developed, it is sent to the 65-1800 combination for detailed\n\
    \   analysis for production.  Many of the computers are running GM's own\n   operating\
    \ systems, and the network control consists of macros added\n   to these operating\
    \ systems.  Interfacing is done by providing\n   specific conversion modules to\
    \ the called when the specific\n   conversion is required.  The 67 will eventually\
    \ be replaced by a\n   hierarchical multiprocessor based on the CDC Star-100.\n\
    \   PHIL MESSING, MITRE,  is setting up an experiment to test the\n   practicability\
    \ of interfacing a network standard data management\n   language with local data\
    \ management systems.  In this experiment, a\n   user will make a request in the\
    \ network language, this request will\n   be transmitted to a node, and translated\
    \ to the language of this\n   local node.  At present, three local systems have\
    \ been selected to be\n   used - MADAM at MIT, LISTAR and Lincoln Labs., and NASIS\
    \ at\n   NASA/Ames.\n   It is not expected that the common data language will\
    \ be able to\n   handle all possible requests that may be made.  The language\
    \ should\n   be able to handle the most common requests, otherwise, some means\
    \ of\n   interaction may be set up in order to allow the transmission of more\n\
    \   information to the target system than the common language may allow,\n   or\
    \ finally, a user can utilize the local target language.\n   At a later stage\
    \ in the experiment, a user will input a query, the\n   local host will determine\
    \ where the query is to be sent, the\n   transmission takes place, it is accepted\
    \ by the target node,\n   translated to the target node's local language and processed.\n\
    \   ERNIE FORMAN, MITRE, is developing a special, simple data management\n   system\
    \ specifically for the purpose of measuring and testing\n   organizational techniques\
    \ for control, directories, and files.  The\n   question to be answered is whether\
    \ each of these three functions\n   should be centralized, or distributed, how,\
    \ and where.  The initial\n   experimental arrangement is to have the control\
    \ and directory\n   centralized at the Rand node, and the files to be distributed\
    \ at\n   UCSB, Rand, and BBN.  The files are each split vertically and\n   distributed,\
    \ this organization chosen to present the more difficult\n   case.\n   DICK WATSON,\
    \ SRI, described some extensions of NIC (Network\n   Information Center) that\
    \ he would like to see, and that would involve\n   network data management facilities.\
    \  The first would be the ability\n   to process text from one text processor\
    \ by another.  Second, it would\n   eventually be desirable to distribute the\
    \ NIC journals.  A first\n   stage of this would be to have several NLS (Network\
    \ Library System)\n   systems around the network, each with its own journal. \
    \ The problems\n   with this first stage would be in coordination of numbering\
    \ and in\n   organization of the directory.  A second stage would be one in which\n\
    \   the journal might reside, in part, on other than NLS systems.\n   A third\
    \ extension is to enable the NLS System to use the results of\n   some other cataloging\
    \ or citation and bibliographic referencing\n   systems as input to the NLS catalogs.\
    \  The fourth extension would be\n   to enable other data management systems to\
    \ generate data of more\n   general type and be usable by the NLS.\n"

  - "PHASE II\n   The second phase of the meeting was a working meeting to try and\n\
    \   organize the committee and try and set up an active working interest\n   group.\n\
    \   The following names presently form the committee.  These are the\n   people\
    \ who have shown active interest, and are engaged in related\n   activities:\n\
    \      Douglas B. McKay        IBM Research (Chairman)\n      Abhay Bhushan  \
    \         MIT\n      Ernie Forman            MITRE\n      Dorothy Hopkin     \
    \     University of Illinois\n      Phil Messing            MITRE\n      A.P.\
    \ Mullery            IBM Research\n      Erika Perez             MITRE\n     \
    \ A. Shoshani             SDC\n      S. Taylor               MITRE\n      Bob\
    \ Thomas              BBN\n      Frank Ulmer             NBS\n      Dick Watson\
    \             SRI\n      Dick Winter             CCA\n   It would be very useful\
    \ in follow-on meetings to have representative\n   from the Form Machine group.\
    \  Discussions on various uses of the Form\n   Machine by a Network Data Management\
    \ facility are bound to come up in\n   later meetings.\n   A member of the form\
    \ machine group would be an asset to the Data\n   Management Committee.\n   Discussion\
    \ on network data management covered many aspects of the\n   problem with a general\
    \ discussion on just what people want to be able\n   to do with a network data\
    \ facility.\n   The following list, gleamed from the discussion, represents the\n\
    \   possible stages of development:\n   1.  Transmission Facility - the Network\
    \ Data Control Facility (DCF)\n       is able to route requests for files to the\
    \ proper node.  The\n       location and name must be specified.\n   2.  Location\
    \ Catalog- The DCF now has available to it a catalog which\n       contains the\
    \ locations of the data sets to be used in the\n       network.  Requests for\
    \ files may be made by name only, the\n       location being determined by the\
    \ DCF.\n   3.  Description Catalog - Descriptions, as well as data sets can be\n\
    \       transmitted in the network.  It is assumed these descriptions\n      \
    \ exist as files at local nodes.  A target node can make use of the\n       description\
    \ to properly convert the data set to its own format.\n   4.  Data Conversion\
    \ Modules - Data descriptions are received by this\n       module of the DCF.\
    \  Based on the descriptions, conversion\n       programs are called or generated\
    \ which will transform a file to\n       the form required by the target node.\n\
    \   5.  File Access Command Interface - this module is able to convert a\n   \
    \    request for a file from a network data language to the local\n       language\
    \ at which the file is located.\n   6.  Data Access - This module, an extension\
    \ of the network data\n       language and the interface modules, allows access\
    \ to pieces of\n       data as specified in the data language, and generates the\
    \ proper\n       local access commands.\n   7.  Data Management Interface - This\
    \ is the final stage, at which\n       general types of commands can be interfaced\
    \ to local data\n       managements systems, providing general interaction among\n\
    \       different data amanagement systems at different nodes.\n   It was generally\
    \ agreed that the ability to access all data and\n   different data bases is a\
    \ goal which is worth achieving.  There was\n   discussion in what is the best\
    \ way to achieve this goal, and the\n   actual implementation techniques that\
    \ could be used to achieve this.\n   It was agreed that the data base interfacing\
    \ problem should be\n   studied in more detail and several people more willing\
    \ to write\n   reports on a representative problem when they have more results\
    \ from\n   their work.\n   There was also a discussion concerning the data language\
    \ and whether\n   it is suitable or not.  One fact should be made clear, the results\
    \ of\n   this committee should not fail or succeed on the outcome of the data\n\
    \   language question.  The initial proposal recommends the Datalanguage\n   as\
    \ de facto standard that will be adopted in the network because of\n   its support\
    \ and availability.  The group should be able to recommend\n   changes when changes\
    \ are shown to be necessary.\n   The Datalanguage discussion did point out the\
    \ need for having data\n   set descriptions cataloged and referable by name -\
    \ D. Winter, said\n   that he would look into this problem.\n   The proposal (RFC\
    \ 304) for a network data facility should be read\n   again and discussed in more\
    \ detail at our next meeting.  The proposal\n   says we can implement and achieve\
    \ a stage 3 capability with what we\n   know today.  It would be a useful stepping\
    \ stone to a stage 5 and\n   stage 6 capability.\n   Related to the stages of\
    \ development described above the following\n   studies are now in progress and\
    \ will help us answer pertinent\n   questions.\n   A. Bhushan is studying a stage\
    \ 1 type of network operation with\n   extension in local catalogs to contain\
    \ entries of network data sets\n   of interest locally, to enable automatic calls\
    \ to foreign data sets.\n   E. Perez will be studying the network catalog structure\
    \ in more\n   detail and will publish an RFC on her work.\n   Many questions were\
    \ raised about the use of the data language as a\n   network standard.  There\
    \ are two people that have volunteered writing\n   up their investigations of\
    \ this important study.\n   Frank Ulmer will be looking at various data management\
    \ systems to see\n   if their data structures are describable in terms of the\n\
    \   Datalanguage.  In addition, the NIC represents one important network\n   data\
    \ base that could be distributed through the network.  Dick Watson\n   will try\
    \ to describe the NLS Journal structure in terms of the\n   Datalanguage.\n  \
    \ If there are any other people in the ARPA network or outside within\n   hearing\
    \ distance of this memo who may know about any real or\n   potential applications\
    \ of data sharing in a network, please submit an\n   RFC in a letter to someone\
    \ associated with the Data Management\n   committee describing it.\n"
