- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   Several sites now contain a complex of local links connected\
    \ to the\n   Internet via a gateway.  The details of the internal connectivity\
    \ are\n   of little interest to the rest of the Internet.\n   One way of organizing\
    \ these local complexes of links is to use the\n   same strategy as the Internet\
    \ uses to organize networks, that is, to\n   declare each link to be an entity\
    \ (like a network) and to\n   interconnect the links with devices that perform\
    \ routing functions\n   (like gateways).  This general scheme is called subnetting,\
    \ the\n   individual links are called subnets, and the connecting devices are\n\
    \   called subgateways (or bridges, or gateways).\n   All hosts in the Internet\
    \ must make a decision when sending a\n   datagram, that is, they must answer\
    \ the question \"Is this datagram\n   addressed to a host on a directly connected\
    \ network, or must it be\n   sent to a gateway?\".  In a subnetted environment,\
    \ this question is\n   extended to \"Is this datagram addressed to a host on a\
    \ directly\n   connected subnet, or must it be sent to a (sub)gateway?\".  Let\
    \ us\n   call answering this question \"making the routing decision\".\n   Because\
    \ the hosts used in a subnetted environment must implement in\n   their IP or\
    \ network interface software procedures for making the\n   routing decision, and\
    \ because such hosts may be acquired from various\n   sources, it is important\
    \ that a standard subnetting scheme be\n   identified so that different suppliers\
    \ can provide compatible hosts\n   (that is, hosts compatible with the complexes\
    \ at different sites and\n   each other).  Without a designated standard for a\
    \ subnetting scheme\n   suppliers can not create compatible hosts.\n   The potential\
    \ problem is that if different subnetting schemes are\n   developed by different\
    \ suppliers a customer that installs hosts from\n   two or more suppliers may\
    \ find that they do not work together.\n"

  contents:
  - "Toward an Internet Standard Scheme for Subnetting\n   This topic has been discussed\
    \ in a set of RFCs [1,2,3,4] and in a\n   flurry of messages in the Gateway Algorithms\
    \ and Data Structures Task\n   Force.  It is strongly suggested that if subnetting\
    \ is used at all,\n   it be according this new standard scheme.\n"
- title: APPROACH
  contents:
  - "APPROACH\n   An Internet address currently consists of a two-layer hierarchy,\
    \ a\n   'network' and a per-network 'rest' field.  This subnet scheme adds an\n\
    \   optional 'subnet' layer and field.\n   The subnet field is created by stealing\
    \ some bits from the rest (or\n   host) field of the address.  The details of\
    \ the subnet field are site\n   specific.  All three classes (A, B, and C) of\
    \ networks may be\n   subnetted.\n   The use of subnets is an optional local decision.\
    \  The fact that a\n   network has subnets is invisible outside that network,\
    \ and the change\n   is local and can be instituted at a site without any global\
    \ Internet\n   perturbations.  A complex of links is assigned a single IP network\n\
    \   number, and outside that complex it appears as a single network with\n   that\
    \ number.  Only inside does local structure appear.\n   However, while the decision\
    \ to use subnets at a site is optional, any\n   IP implementation which may possibly\
    \ be used in a potentially\n   subnetted environment, should provide for subnet\
    \ field configuration\n   as described above.  Such an implementation will function\
    \ properly in\n   environments with or without subnetting.  On the other hand,\n\
    \   implementations lacking this provision will not function in a\n   subnetted\
    \ environment, and are thus potentially less useful.\n   This specifications is\
    \ not intended to require a particular\n   implementation technique inside the\
    \ host, but rather to define the\n   external behavior of the host in a subnetted\
    \ environment.  It does\n   not specify how routing is done or the details of\
    \ host construction.\n   Note that gateways are hosts, too.\n   However, it seems\
    \ easiest to explain the approach by describing one\n   possible host implementation.\n\
    \      Example Implementation:\n         Let us use \"subnet\" to mean the locally\
    \ attached transmission\n         medium.\n         The key decision to be made\
    \ is \"Is the destination IP address\n"

    .  Once this decision is made the host\n         knows to whether to send the\
    \ datagram directly to the\n         destination on the subnet or to send the\
    \ datagram to a gateway.\n         The host uses a 32-bit mask, along with the\
    \ host's own IP\n         address, to determine whether or not destination IP\
    \ addresses\n         are on its subnet.\n         The mask can be configured\
    \ at boot time as a static quantity or\n         distributed by a protocol that\
    \ is beyond the scope of this\n         memo.\n         If the bitwise AND of\
    \ the mask with the destination IP address\n         matches the bitwise AND of\
    \ the mask with the host's own IP\n         address, the destination is assumed\
    \ on its subnet; if not, the\n         destination is assumed on a subnet or network\
    \ reachable only\n         via a gateway.\n            Note: if the mask is all\
    \ zeros, all destinations will appear\n            to be on this subnet; while,\
    \ if the mask is all ones, only\n            the sending host itself will appear\
    \ to be on this subnet.\n            If the mask contains ones in the network\
    \ field and zeros in\n            the rest field, subnets are not in use.\n  \
    \       The above procedure must be treated as a per interface\n         procedure\
    \ for multihomed hosts.\n   For further information on background and rationale,\
    \ see RFC-917,\n   \"Internet Subnets\" [1].\n"
