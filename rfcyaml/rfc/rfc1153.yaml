  - "                         Digest Message Format\nStatus of this Memo\n   This\
    \ memo describes the de facto standard Digest Message Format.\n   This is an elective\
    \ experimental protocol.  Distribution of this memo\n   is unlimited.\nBackground\n\
    \   High traffic volume large mailing lists began to appear on the net in\n  \
    \ the mid-70s.  The moderators of those lists developed a digest\n   message format\
    \ to enclose several messages into one composite message\n   for redistribution\
    \ to the mailing list addressees.  This format\n   reduces the mailer load in\
    \ proportion to the number of messages\n   contained within a digest message,\
    \ and conserves network bandwidth by\n   reducing the size of the headers of the\
    \ enclosed messages.\n   This RFC documents the digest message format so that\
    \ others may\n   follow this format in creating (digestifying) and separating\n\
    \   (undigestifying) digest messages to maintain compatibility with the\n   programs\
    \ expecting this de facto standard.  Any editorial functions\n   performed at\
    \ the discretion of a digest moderator, such as discarding\n   submissions, editing\
    \ content to correct spelling and punctuation\n   errors, inserting comments,\
    \ and reformatting paragraphs to conform to\n   width conventions are beyond the\
    \ scope of this memo.\n   This memo describes the de facto standard Digest Message\
    \ Format.  It\n   is not meant to supersede nor replace the generic message\n\
    \   encapsulation format described in RFC 934.  It merely documents a\n   particular\
    \ message encapsulation format that existed well before RFC\n   934 was published\
    \ and continues to be the format of choice for digest\n   messages.\nDescription\n\
    \   A digest message is a conventional message consisting of a header and\n  \
    \ body conforming to RFC 822 as clarified in RFC 1123.  There is no\n   fixed\
    \ size.  Limitations may exist in intermediate mail gateways\n   which restrict\
    \ the size.  The typical digest size is 15,000\n   characters.\n   The header\
    \ of a digest message should identify the digest in the\n   Subject line by listname,\
    \ the key word, Digest, the volume number\n   (usually a sequential number either\
    \ starting at 1 or the last two\n   digits of the year and incremented by one\
    \ starting with the first\n   issue of the next calendar year), and an issue number\
    \ starting at one\n   for the first issue of a new calendar year.\n   The body\
    \ of a digest message must consist of a Preamble, one or more\n   enclosed messages,\
    \ and a Trailer.\n   The Preamble usually contains a table of contents consisting\
    \ of the\n   subject line contents of the enclosed messages, usually indented\
    \ or\n   centered, and also may contain brief administrative or other\n   announcements.\n\
    \   The Preamble must be separated from the remainder of the message by a\n  \
    \ line of 70 hyphens followed by a blank line.\n   Each enclosed message is a\
    \ conventional message consisting of a\n   header and body, separated by a blank\
    \ line.  If they exist in the\n   original message header, the following lines\
    \ must be retained as-is\n   in the reconstructed header: Date:, From:, To:, Cc:,\
    \ Subject:,\n   Message-ID:, and Keywords:, rearranged to appear in that order.\n\
    \   Retaining the Summary: line is optional.  Lines include continuation\n   lines\
    \ as defined in the RFCs.  All other header lines should be\n   discarded, especially\
    \ Received lines.  All leading and trailing blank\n   lines should be removed\
    \ from the message body.  The message body may\n   be scanned to replace with\
    \ a blank the first character of any lines\n   of exactly and only 30 hyphens.\n\
    \   Each enclosed message must be separated from the the remainder of the\n  \
    \ digest message by a blank line before and after a line of 30 hyphens.\n   The\
    \ Trailer immediately follows the blank line of message separator\n   following\
    \ the last enclosed message.  The Trailer consists of two\n   lines.  The first\
    \ line must begin with the words, End of, followed by\n   the listname a blank\
    \ and the word Digest which is usually followed by\n   volume and issue number\
    \ on the same line.  The second and last line\n   of the Trailer and the entire\
    \ message is a line of asterisks serving\n   to underline the line immediately\
    \ above it.\nExample\n   The following example serves as a template for a digest\
    \ message\n   conforming to this memo.  It contains a header, and a body consisting\n\
    \   of a Preamble, two enclosed messages, and a Trailer.  fqhn means\n   Fully\
    \ Qualified Host Name.  The Date: lines are examples only.\nDate: ddd, dd mmm\
