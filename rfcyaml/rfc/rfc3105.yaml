  - "IESG Note\n   The IESG notes that the set of documents describing the RSIP\n\
    \   technology imply significant host and gateway changes for a complete\n   implementation.\
    \  In addition, the floating of port numbers can cause\n   problems for some applications,\
    \ preventing an RSIP-enabled host from\n   interoperating transparently with existing\
    \ applications in some cases\n   (e.g., IPsec).  Finally, there may be significant\
    \ operational\n   complexities associated with using RSIP.  Some of these and\
    \ other\n   complications are outlined in section 6 of the RFC 3102, as well as\n\
    \   in the Appendices of RFC 3104.  Accordingly, the costs and benefits\n   of\
    \ using RSIP should be carefully weighed against other means of\n   relieving\

  - "Abstract\n   This document contains an SLP service type template that describes\n\
    \   the advertisements made by RSIP servers for their services.  Service\n   Location\
    \ Protocol (SLP) is an IETF standards track protocol\n   specifically designed\
    \ to allow clients to find servers offering\n   particular services.  Since RSIP\
    \ (Realm Specific IP) clients require\n   a mechanism to discover RSIP servers,\
    \ SLP is a natural match for a\n   solution.  The service type template is the\
    \ basis for an Internet\n   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) standard definition\
    \ of the\n   advertisements offered by RSIP servers, an important step toward\n\
    \   interoperability.\n"

- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Realm Specific IP (RSIP) [7] enables an RSIP client in one\
    \ realm to\n   borrow addresses and other resources from another realm.  It does\
    \ so\n   by engaging in an RSIP protocol [1] exchange with an RSIP server.\n \
    \  The RSIP protocol requires the RSIP server to have a permanent\n   presence\
    \ on both realms.\n   There are a variety of traditional ways an RSIP client could\
    \ go about\n   locating the appropriate RSIP server.  However, Service Location\n\
    \   Protocol (SLP) [2][11] is an IETF standards track protocol\n   specifically\
    \ designed to facilitate location of services and their\n   servers by clients.\
    \  SLP provides a number of features that simplify\n   locating RSIP servers.\
    \  In this document, we describe how RSIP\n   clients can use SLP to discover\
    \ RSIP servers.\n"

- title: 4.  Using SLP for RSIP Service Discovery
  contents:
  - "4.  Using SLP for RSIP Service Discovery\n   SLP provides the framework in which\
    \ RSIP clients and servers make\n   contact.  Here is a description of how an\
    \ RSIP server and client find\n   each other using SLP:\n   1. The RSIP server\
    \ implements a SLP SA while the RSIP client\n      implements an SLP UA.\n   2.\
    \ The RSIP SA constructs a service advertisement consisting of a\n      service\
    \ URL, attributes and a lifetime.  The URL has service type\n      \"service:rsip\"\
    , and attributes defined according to the template\n      in Section 7.\n   3.\
    \ If an SLP DA is found, the SA contacts the DA and registers the\n      advertisement.\
    \  If no DA is found, the SA maintains the\n      advertisement itself, answering\
    \ multicast UA queries directly.\n   4. When the RSIP client requires contact\
    \ information for an RSIP\n      server, the UA either contacts the DA using unicast\
    \ or the SA\n      using multicast.  The UA includes a query based on the attributes\n\
    \      to indicate the characteristics of the server it requires.\n   5. Once\
    \ the UA has the host name or address of the RSIP server as\n      well as the\
    \ port number, it can begin negotiation using the RSIP\n      protocol.\n   This\
    \ procedure is exactly the same for any client/server pair\n   implementing SLP\
    \ and is not specific to RSIP.\n   Many protocols use a variety of traditional\
    \ methods for service\n   discovery.  These methods include static configuration,\
    \ purpose-build\n   protocols for discovery, special features in the protocol\
    \ itself, DNS\n   SRV RRs [5], or DHCP [6].  SLP provides a number of advantages\
    \ over\n   these traditional methods:\n   1. Discovery of services using SLP is\
    \ dynamic, whereas many of the\n      traditional methods only allow static or\
    \ weakly dynamic (i.e.,\n      difficult to update) discovery.  Clients only discover\
    \ services\n      that are actually active with SLP.  Furthermore, if subsequent\
    \ to\n      initial discovery a server goes down, the client can reissue an\n\
    \      SLP query and obtain a new server.  On the server side, no\n      databases\
    \ must be updated to provide dynamic discovery, the\n      servers advertise themselves.\n\
    \   2. SLP requires no third party configuration.  Only the server\n      offering\
    \ the service and the client seeking it are required to\n      know the details\
    \ for the particular service type.\n   3. SLP allows clients to specify the attributes\
    \ describing the\n      desired server.  A client discovers servers that meet\
    \ a set of\n      specific requirements.  This reduces the amount of network traffic\n\
    \      involved in selecting a server when many possible choices are\n      available.\n\
    \   4. SLP contains a number of scaling mechanisms (DAs, scopes,\n      multicast\
    \ convergence algorithm), that facilitate deployment in\n      large enterprise\
    \ networks as well as in smaller networks.\n"
- title: 5.  Using Scopes for Server Provisioning
  contents:
  - "5.  Using Scopes for Server Provisioning\n   One particular design feature of\
    \ SLP that is useful for RSIP is\n   scopes.  Scopes in SLP are a mechanism for\
    \ provisioning access to\n   particular service advertisements.  An administrator\
    \ assigns UAs and\n   SAs to particular scopes to assure that UAs only find SAs\
    \ in those\n   scopes.  Scopes are not an access control mechanism for the service\n\
    \   itself, however.  UAs from outside the scope can still access\n   services\
    \ in a particular scope (unless the service itself provides\n   for access control),\
    \ they just won't be able to find the services\n   using SLP.\n   Scopes are useful\
    \ for RSIP service advertisement provisioning because\n   they allow a system\
    \ administrator to tie particular RSIP clients to\n   specific RSIP servers. \
    \ For example, consider the network\n   architecture described in Section 4.2.1\
    \ of [7].  RSIP clients are\n   recommended to find \"the nearest\" RSIP server,\
    \ but exactly how that\n   should be arranged is left unspecified.  SLP provides\
    \ a way for\n   system administrators to precisely specify which realm an RSIP\
    \ client\n   resides in, by tying the realm to an SLP scope.  The diagram from\n\
    \   Section 14.1 is reproduced here, with SLP scopes included to\n   illustrate\
    \ how clients could be directed to the right RSIP servers.\n                 \

    \           |\n                                +-----------+\n   Clients on the\
    \ upper 10.0.0.0/8 network are configured to use SLP\n   scope B, while clients\
    \ on the lower 10.0.0.0/8 network are configured\n   to use SLP scope C.  RSIP\
    \ servers B and C (as clients of server A)\n   use SLP to locate RSIP server A,\
    \ as do other RSIP clients on the\n   10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 subnets.  Within\
    \ these two subnets, all\n   clients have their scopes configured to be A.\n \
    \  Note that specifying a particular SLP scope for RSIP clients does not\n   restrict\
    \ the SLP scope for other services advertised by SLP.  SLP UAs\n   can be configured\
    \ for multiple scopes, so the scope configured for\n   printing may be different\
    \ from the scope configured for RSIP service.\n   Since SLP scopes are configured\
    \ through a DHCP option [8], along with\n   the IP address, system administrators\
    \ can easily switch a cluster of\n   machines from one realm to another by simply\
    \ changing the scope and\n   IP address assignments on the DHCP server.  For example,\
    \ in the above\n   architecture, suppose a system administrator wanted to remove\
    \ RSIP\n   server B so that clients on the upper 10.0.0.0/8 subnet were directly\n\
    \   on subnet 10.0.1.0/24.  These clients now communicate with RSIP\n   server\
    \ A.  By simply changing the address assignments and scope\n   configuration of\
    \ these clients on the DHCP server, the realm can be\n   effectively switched.\n"
- title: 6.  Load Balancing
  contents:
  - "6.  Load Balancing\n   While SLP itself contains no specific provision for load\
    \ balancing,\n   load balancing can easily be implemented using SLP.  The only\n\
    \   requirement is that the service type template specify an attribute\n   indicating\
    \ server load.  In the case of RSIP, the service type\n   template in Section\
    \ 7  contains such an attribute.  The attribute\n   indicates the number of RSIP\
    \ client sessions currently being\n   supported by the server.\n   In order to\
    \ perform load balancing, the RSIP server must update its\n   service advertisement\
    \ periodically as new connections are accepted.\n   An RSIP client seeking to\
    \ find the server having the lightest load\n   performs the following series of\
    \ SLP operations.\n   1. As in Section 4, the client issues an SLP service request\
    \ and\n      collects all the returned service URLs.\n   2. For each service URL,\
    \ the client performs an SLP attribute request\n      for the attribute LOAD.\
    \  The integer load figures are returned.\n   3. The client sorts through the\
    \ returned load figures and selects the\n      URL having the least number of\
    \ connections.  The client\n      establishes its RSIP session with that server.\n\
    \   Because of network delays, this procedure does not guarantee that a\n   client\
    \ will always obtain a connection with the lightest loaded\n   server, but it\
    \ does provide a high probability that the selected\n   server is more lightly\
    \ loaded.\n   A similar procedure is used in [9] to load balance access to TN3270E\n\
    \   telnet servers.\n"
