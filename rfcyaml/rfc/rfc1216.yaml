  - "1. Introduction\n   The history of computer communication contains many examples\
    \ of\n   efforts to align the capabilities of processors to that of\n   communication\
    \ media.  Packet switching is the classic case of a\n   careful tradeoff between\
    \ the costs of memory, processing, and\n   communications bandwidth.\n   With\
    \ all of the attention and publicity focused on gigabit networks,\n   not much\
    \ notice has been given to small and largely unfunded research\n   efforts which\
    \ are studying innovative approaches for dealing with\n   technical issues within\
    \ the constraints of economic science.  This\n   memo defines one such paradigm.\n"

  - "2. Contemporary Network Economics\n   Recent cost estimates predict a continuing\
    \ decline in the cost for\n   processing, memory, and communication.  One recent\
    \ projection put the\n   decline for $/bit and $/MIP at 99% per decade and put\
    \ the decline for\n   $/bps at 90% per decade.  Scalable parallel processor designs\
    \ may\n   accelerate the cost declines for CPU and memory, but no similar\n  \
    \ accelerated decline should be expected in the cost of communications.\n   Such\
    \ a decline would imply eventual declines in the cost of 56Kbps\n   service used\
    \ for voice, resulting in a negative rate of return for\n   telecommunications\
    \ carriers, an unlikely eventuality even if free-\n   market forces are carried\
    \ to their logical extreme.\n   Increases in processing power create additional\
    \ demand for\n   communications bandwidth, but do nothing to pay for it.  While\
    \ we\n   will sell no paradigm before its time, the 9% difference,\n   particularly\
    \ after compounding is taken into account, will bankrupt\n   the internet community\
    \ unless a paradigm shift takes place.\n"

  - "3. The ULS Paradigm Shift\n   The ULS paradigm shift breaks the downward spiral\
    \ by concentrating on\n   end-to-end datagrams and virtual circuit services operating\
    \ in the\n   .01 uGbps region, namely Ultra Low Speed networking.\n   However,\n\
    \   \"The worlds best technological paradigm shifts are useless unless\n   they\
    \ (a) are economically viable, (b) have clear applicability, (c)\n   are technically\
    \ feasible.\"\n           --Milton John in \"Paradigms Lost\"\n"
- title: 3.1 Economic Viability
  contents:
  - "3.1 Economic Viability\n   Cost projections indicate that individual ULS circuits\
    \ can be\n   provided at a cost of <$.03/month due to the unusually high\n   multiplexing\
    \ that will be possible on Gbit links.  The 10 THz\n   bandwidth of existing optical\
    \ fibers will be able to support on the\n   order of 1 TUser, handling population\
    \ growth, and even internet\n   growth, for some time.  Moreover, if $.03/month\
    \ is a significant\n   barrier to entry, substantial discounts appear to be economically\n\
    \   feasible.\n"
- title: 3.2 Clear Applicability
  contents:
  - "3.2 Clear Applicability\n   A fundamental principle of networking is that network\
    \ speed must\n   match the application.  We have identified a number of critical\n\
    \   applications that are matched to ULS technology.  Below we itemize a\n   few\
    \ of these, but we provide a brief description for only the first;\n   the match\
    \ for the others should be equally obvious.\n   - Low priority facsimile: A large\
    \ percentage of documents and letters\n     are sent via facsimile not because\
    \ they need sub-minute delivery,\n     but because they carry signatures or graphics.\
    \  In these cases, a\n     three-hour delivery (comparable to the value reliably\
    \ achieved on\n     many of today's packet-based email systems) is sufficient.\
    \  With\n     proper compression, this delivery time can be achieved over a\n\
    \     ULSnet.\n   - Real time data (e.g., tracking glaciers)\n   - US postal service\n\
    \   - Contracting for research\n   To be truly viable, ULS networking must scale,\
    \ and indeed it does.\n   With some effort, we envision extending the technology\
    \ to the\n   extremely-low-speed regime.  Applications that scale from the ULS\n\
    \   applications above are:\n   - Real time data (e.g., gravity wave detectors)\n\
    \   - Italian postal service\n   - Congressional budget process\n"
- title: 3.3 Technical Feasibility
  contents:
  - "3.3 Technical Feasibility\n   The hardware issues are well in hand.  The remaining\
    \ issues are\n   protocol related.  To examine them, we must extrapolate backward\
    \ from\n   some well known networking principles.\n   \"Gigabit networks require\
    \ new protocols.\"\n   The clear inference here is that ULS will require old protocols,\
    \ so\n   as we recede into the future, we should expect the following:\n   ULS\
    \ will require minimal development.  Although we may need research\n   in storage\
    \ technology to recover the software from old media such as\n   decayed magnetic\
    \ dump tapes, paper tape, and partially recycled card\n   decks, this effort will\
    \ be more than offset by the savings.\n   ULS protocols will be well documented,\
    \ amenable to verification, and\n   suitable for MSI implementation in Silicon,\
    \ or even Germanium or\n   relays.  In particular, the alternating bit protocol\
    \ [1] is a leading\n   contender.\n   \"Bad news travel fast.\"\n   Therefore,\
    \ ULS gives preferential treatment to good news.  While this\n   will delay the\
    \ delivery of bills, notices from timeshare\n   condominiums, and contest announcements,\
    \ it will also produce\n   immediate productivity gains on several mailing lists.\n"
- title: 3.4 Problems Requiring Work
  contents:
  - "3.4 Problems Requiring Work\n   ULS is not without problems.\n   Some other well-known\
    \ protocol suites are well ahead of ULS in\n   exploring the desired performance\
    \ operating point.  We note our\n   concern about the dearth of domestic (U.S.-based)\
    \ research and\n   development in this important area.  This is particularly disturbing\n\
    \   in light of the level of work now underway in other countries.\n   Efficiency\
    \ is a problem:\n   - All ULS protocols incorporate slow-start.\n   - Lower data\
    \ rates mean fewer errors.\n   - Whereas modern protocols use 32 bit sequence\
    \ numbers,\n     acknowledgment fields, etc., ULS headers can be quite small (1\
    \ bit\n     sequence numbers for the alternating-bit protocol).  Thus the\n  \
    \   header/data ratio shrinks.\n   The net result is \"creeping efficiency\" which\
    \ tends to push us away\n   from the proper ULS operating point.  While we have\
    \ no definitive\n   solution, there are several promising palliatives:\n   - Forward\
    \ Error Insertion (FEI)\n   - Negative window scaling factors\n   - New protocol\
    \ layers\n   - Multiple presentation layers\n"
