  - "Abstract\n   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) supports static provisioning\
    \ of\n   transport paths via a Network Management System (NMS) and dynamic\n \
    \  provisioning of transport paths via a control plane.  This document\n   provides\
    \ the framework for MPLS-TP dynamic provisioning and covers\n   control-plane\
    \ addressing, routing, path computation, signaling,\n   traffic engineering, and\
    \ path recovery.  MPLS-TP uses GMPLS as the\n   control plane for MPLS-TP Label\
    \ Switched Paths (LSPs).  MPLS-TP also\n   uses the pseudowire (PW) control plane\
    \ for pseudowires.  Management-\n   plane functions are out of scope of this document.\n\
    \   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\n  \
    \ (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n   Standardization\
    \ Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile within the IETF\
    \ MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge\n   (PWE3) architectures to support\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)\
    \ is\n   defined as a joint effort between the International Telecommunication\n\
    \   Union (ITU) and the IETF.  The requirements for MPLS-TP are defined\n   in\
    \ the requirements document, see [RFC5654].  These requirements\n   state that\
    \ \"A solution MUST be defined to support dynamic\n   provisioning of MPLS-TP\
    \ transport paths via a control plane\".  This\n   document provides the framework\
    \ for such dynamic provisioning.  This\n   document is a product of a joint Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n\
    \   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile\
    \ within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge\n   (PWE3) architectures\
    \ to support the capabilities and functions of a\n   packet transport network\
    \ as defined by the ITU-T.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope\n   This document covers the control-plane functions involved in\n\
    \   establishing MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and pseudowires\n   (PWs).\
    \  The control-plane requirements for MPLS-TP are defined in the\n   MPLS-TP requirements\
    \ document [RFC5654].  These requirements define\n   the role of the control plane\
    \ in MPLS-TP.  In particular, Section 2.4\n   of [RFC5654] and portions of the\
    \ remainder of Section 2 of [RFC5654]\n   provide specific control-plane requirements.\n\
    \   The LSPs provided by MPLS-TP are used as a server layer for IP, MPLS,\n  \
    \ and PWs, as well as other tunneled MPLS-TP LSPs.  The PWs are used to\n   carry\
    \ client signals other than IP or MPLS.  The relationship between\n   PWs and\
    \ MPLS-TP LSPs is exactly the same as between PWs and MPLS LSPs\n   in an MPLS\
    \ Packet Switched Network (PSN).  The PW encapsulation over\n   MPLS-TP LSPs used\
    \ in MPLS-TP networks is also the same as for PWs\n   over MPLS in an MPLS network.\
    \  MPLS-TP also defines protection and\n   restoration (or, collectively, recovery)\
    \ functions; see [RFC5654] and\n   [RFC4427].  The MPLS-TP control plane provides\
    \ methods to establish,\n   remove, and control MPLS-TP LSPs and PWs.  This includes\
    \ control of\n   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), data-plane,\
    \ and\n   recovery functions.\n   A general framework for MPLS-TP has been defined\
    \ in [RFC5921], and a\n   survivability framework for MPLS-TP has been defined\
    \ in [RFC6372].\n   These documents scope the approaches and protocols that are\
    \ the\n   foundation of MPLS-TP.  Notably, Section 3.5 of [RFC5921] scopes the\n\
    \   IETF protocols that serve as the foundation of the MPLS-TP control\n   plane.\
    \  The PW control plane is based on the existing PW control\n   plane (see [RFC4447])\
    \ and the PWE3 architecture (see [RFC3985]).  The\n   LSP control plane is based\
    \ on GMPLS (see [RFC3945]), which is built\n   on MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE)\
    \ and its numerous extensions.\n   [RFC6372] focuses on the recovery functions\
    \ that must be supported\n   within MPLS-TP.  It does not specify which control-plane\
    \ mechanisms\n   are to be used.\n   The remainder of this document discusses\
    \ the impact of the MPLS-TP\n   requirements on the GMPLS signaling and routing\
    \ protocols that are\n   used to control MPLS-TP LSPs, and on the control of PWs\
    \ as specified\n   in [RFC4447], [RFC6073], and [MS-PW-DYNAMIC].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Basic Approach
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Basic Approach\n   The basic approach taken in defining the MPLS-TP control-plane\n\
    \   framework includes the following:\n      1) MPLS technology as defined by\
    \ the IETF is the foundation for\n         the MPLS Transport Profile.\n     \
    \ 2) The data plane for MPLS-TP is a standard MPLS data plane\n         [RFC3031]\
    \ as profiled in [RFC5960].\n      3) MPLS PWs are used by MPLS-TP including the\
    \ use of targeted\n         Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) as the foundation\
    \ for PW\n         signaling [RFC4447].  This also includes the use of Open\n\
    \         Shortest Path First with Traffic Engineering (OSPF-TE),\n         Intermediate\
    \ System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) with Traffic\n         Engineering (ISIS-TE),\
    \ or Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol\n         (MP-BGP) as they apply for\
    \ Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW)\n         routing.  However, the PW can be\
    \ encapsulated over an MPLS-TP\n         LSP (established using methods and procedures\
    \ for MPLS-TP LSP\n         establishment) in addition to the presently defined\
    \ methods of\n         carrying PWs over LSP-based PSNs.  That is, the MPLS-TP\
    \ domain\n         is a PSN from a PWE3 architecture perspective [RFC3985].\n\
    \      4) The MPLS-TP LSP control plane builds on the GMPLS control plane\n  \
    \       as defined by the IETF for transport LSPs.  The protocols\n         within\
    \ scope are Resource Reservation Protocol with Traffic\n         Engineering (RSVP-TE)\
    \ [RFC3473], OSPF-TE [RFC4203] [RFC5392],\n         and ISIS-TE [RFC5307] [RFC5316].\
    \  Automatically Switched\n         Optical Network (ASON) signaling and routing\
    \ requirements in\n         the context of GMPLS can be found in [RFC4139] and\
    \ [RFC4258].\n      5) Existing IETF MPLS and GMPLS RFCs and evolving Working\
    \ Group\n         Internet-Drafts should be reused wherever possible.\n      6)\
    \ If needed, extensions for the MPLS-TP control plane should\n         first be\
    \ based on the existing and evolving IETF work, and\n         secondly be based\
    \ on work by other standard bodies only when\n         IETF decides that the work\
    \ is out of the IETF's scope.  New\n         extensions may be defined otherwise.\n\
    \      7) Extensions to the control plane may be required in order to\n      \
    \   fully automate functions related to MPLS-TP LSPs and PWs.\n      8) Control-plane\
    \ software upgrades to existing equipment are\n         acceptable and expected.\n\
    \      9) It is permissible for functions present in the GMPLS and PW\n      \
    \   control planes to not be used in MPLS-TP networks.\n     10) One possible\
    \ use of the control plane is to configure, enable,\n         and generally control\
    \ OAM functionality.  This will require\n         extensions to existing control-plane\
    \ specifications that will\n         be usable in MPLS-TP as well as MPLS networks.\n\
    \     11) The foundation for MPLS-TP control-plane requirements is\n         primarily\
    \ found in Section 2.4 of [RFC5654] and relevant\n         portions of the remainder\
    \ of Section 2 of [RFC5654].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Reference Model
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Reference Model\n   The control-plane reference model is based on the general\
    \ MPLS-TP\n   reference model as defined in the MPLS-TP framework [RFC5921] and\n\
    \   further refined in [RFC6215] on the MPLS-TP User-to-Network and\n   Network-to-Network\
    \ Interfaces (UNI and NNI, respectively).  Per the\n   MPLS-TP framework [RFC5921],\
    \ the MPLS-TP control plane is based on\n   GMPLS with RSVP-TE for LSP signaling\
    \ and targeted LDP for PW\n   signaling.  In both cases, OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE with\
    \ GMPLS extensions\n   is used for dynamic routing within an MPLS-TP domain.\n\
    \   Note that in this context, \"targeted LDP\" (or T-LDP) means LDP as\n   defined\
    \ in RFC 5036, using Targeted Hello messages.  See Section\n   2.4.2 (\"Extended\
    \ Discovery Mechanism\") of [RFC5036].  Use of the\n   extended discovery mechanism\
    \ is specified in Section 5 (\"LDP\") of\n   [RFC4447].\n   From a service perspective,\
    \ MPLS-TP client services may be supported\n   via both PWs and LSPs.  PW client\
    \ interfaces, or adaptations, are\n   defined on an interface-technology basis,\
    \ e.g., Ethernet over PW\n   [RFC4448].  In the context of MPLS-TP LSP, the client\
    \ interface is\n   provided at the network layer and may be controlled via a GMPLS-based\n\
    \   UNI, see [RFC4208], or statically provisioned.  As discussed in\n   [RFC5921]\
    \ and [RFC6215], MPLS-TP also presumes an NNI reference\n   point.\n   The MPLS-TP\
    \ end-to-end control-plane reference model is shown in\n   Figure 1.  The figure\
    \ shows the control-plane protocols used by MPLS-\n   TP, as well as the UNI and\
    \ NNI reference points, in the case of a\n   Single-Segment PW supported by an\
    \ end-to-end LSP without any\n   hierarchical LSPs.  (The MS-PW case is not shown.)\
    \  Each service\n   provider node's participation in routing and signaling (both\
    \ GMPLS\n   RSVP-TE and PW LDP) is represented.  Note that only the service end\n\
    \   points participate in PW LDP signaling, while all service provider\n   nodes\
    \ participate in GMPLS TE LSP routing and signaling.\n       |< ---- client signal\

- title: 2.  Control-Plane Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Control-Plane Requirements\n   The requirements for the MPLS-TP control plane\
    \ are derived from the\n   MPLS-TP requirements and framework documents, specifically\
    \ [RFC5654],\n   [RFC5921], [RFC5860], [RFC6371], and [RFC6372].  The requirements\
    \ are\n   summarized in this section, but do not replace those documents.  If\n\
    \   there are differences between this section and those documents, those\n  \
    \ documents shall be considered authoritative.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Primary Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Primary Requirements\n   These requirements are based on Section 2 of [RFC5654]:\n\
    \      1. Any new functionality that is defined to fulfill the\n         requirements\
    \ for MPLS-TP must be agreed within the IETF through\n         the IETF consensus\
    \ process as per [RFC4929] and Section 1,\n         paragraph 15 of [RFC5654].\n\
    \      2. The MPLS-TP control-plane design should as far as reasonably\n     \
    \    possible reuse existing MPLS standards ([RFC5654], requirement\n        \
    \ 2).\n      3. The MPLS-TP control plane must be able to interoperate with\n\
    \         existing IETF MPLS and PWE3 control planes where appropriate\n     \
    \    ([RFC5654], requirement 3).\n      4. The MPLS-TP control plane must be sufficiently\
    \ well-defined to\n         ensure that the interworking between equipment supplied\
    \ by\n         multiple vendors will be possible both within a single domain\n\
    \         and between domains ([RFC5654], requirement 4).\n      5. The MPLS-TP\
    \ control plane must support a connection-oriented\n         packet switching\
    \ model with traffic engineering capabilities\n         that allow deterministic\
    \ control of the use of network\n         resources ([RFC5654], requirement 5).\n\
    \      6. The MPLS-TP control plane must support traffic-engineered\n        \
    \ point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-multipoint (P2MP) transport\n         paths\
    \ ([RFC5654], requirement 6).\n      7. The MPLS-TP control plane must support\
    \ unidirectional,\n         associated bidirectional and co-routed bidirectional\
    \ point-to-\n         point transport paths ([RFC5654], requirement 7).\n    \
    \  8. The MPLS-TP control plane must support unidirectional point-to-\n      \
    \   multipoint transport paths ([RFC5654], requirement 8).\n      9. The MPLS-TP\
    \ control plane must enable all nodes (i.e., ingress,\n         egress, and intermediate)\
    \ to be aware about the pairing\n         relationship of the forward and the\
    \ backward directions\n         belonging to the same co-routed bidirectional\
    \ transport path\n         ([RFC5654], requirement 10).\n     10. The MPLS-TP\
    \ control plane must enable edge nodes (i.e., ingress\n         and egress) to\
    \ be aware of the pairing relationship of the\n         forward and the backward\
    \ directions belonging to the same\n         associated bidirectional transport\
    \ path ([RFC5654], requirement\n         11).\n     11. The MPLS-TP control plane\
    \ should enable common transit nodes to\n         be aware of the pairing relationship\
    \ of the forward and the\n         backward directions belonging to the same associated\n\
    \         bidirectional transport path ([RFC5654], requirement 12).\n     12.\
    \ The MPLS-TP control plane must support bidirectional transport\n         paths\
    \ with symmetric bandwidth requirements, i.e., the amount\n         of reserved\
    \ bandwidth is the same in the forward and backward\n         directions ([RFC5654],\
    \ requirement 13).\n     13. The MPLS-TP control plane must support bidirectional\
    \ transport\n         paths with asymmetric bandwidth requirements, i.e., the\
    \ amount\n         of reserved bandwidth differs in the forward and backward\n\
    \         directions ([RFC5654], requirement 14).\n     14. The MPLS-TP control\
    \ plane must support the logical separation\n         of the control plane from\
    \ the management and data planes\n         ([RFC5654], requirement 15).  Note\
    \ that this implies that the\n         addresses used in the control plane are\
    \ independent from the\n         addresses used in the management and data planes.\n\
    \     15. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the physical separation\n   \
    \      of the control plane from the management and data plane, and no\n     \
    \    assumptions should be made about the state of the data-plane\n         channels\
    \ from information about the control- or management-\n         plane channels\
    \ when they are running out-of-band ([RFC5654],\n         requirement 16).\n \
    \    16. A control plane must be defined to support dynamic provisioning\n   \
    \      and restoration of MPLS-TP transport paths, but its use is a\n        \
    \ network operator's choice ([RFC5654], requirement 18).\n     17. The presence\
    \ of a control plane must not be required for static\n         provisioning of\
    \ MPLS-TP transport paths ([RFC5654], requirement\n         19).\n     18. The\
    \ MPLS-TP control plane must permit the coexistence of\n         statically and\
    \ dynamically provisioned/managed MPLS-TP\n         transport paths within the\
    \ same layer network or domain\n         ([RFC5654], requirement 20).\n     19.\
    \ The MPLS-TP control plane should be operable in a way that is\n         similar\
    \ to the way the control plane operates in other\n         transport-layer technologies\
    \ ([RFC5654], requirement 21).\n     20. The MPLS-TP control plane must avoid\
    \ or minimize traffic impact\n         (e.g., packet delay, reordering, and loss)\
    \ during network\n         reconfiguration ([RFC5654], requirement 24).\n    \
    \ 21. The MPLS-TP control plane must work across multiple homogeneous\n      \
    \   domains ([RFC5654], requirement 25), i.e., all domains use the\n         same\
    \ MPLS-TP control plane.\n     22. The MPLS-TP control plane should work across\
    \ multiple non-\n         homogeneous domains ([RFC5654], requirement 26), i.e.,\
    \ some\n         domains use the same control plane and other domains use static\n\
    \         provisioning at the domain boundary.\n     23. The MPLS-TP control plane\
    \ must not dictate any particular\n         physical or logical topology ([RFC5654],\
    \ requirement 27).\n     24. The MPLS-TP control plane must include support of\
    \ ring\n         topologies that may be deployed with arbitrary interconnection\n\
    \         and support of rings of at least 16 nodes ([RFC5654],\n         requirements\
    \ 27.A, 27.B, and 27.C).\n     25. The MPLS-TP control plane must scale gracefully\
    \ to support a\n         large number of transport paths, nodes, and links.  That\
    \ is, it\n         must be able to scale at least as well as control planes in\n\
    \         existing transport technologies with growing and increasingly\n    \
    \     complex network topologies as well as with increasing bandwidth\n      \
    \   demands, number of customers, and number of services\n         ([RFC5654],\
    \ requirements 53 and 28).\n     26. The MPLS-TP control plane should not provision\
    \ transport paths\n         that contain forwarding loops ([RFC5654], requirement\
    \ 29).\n     27. The MPLS-TP control plane must support multiple client layers\n\
    \         (e.g., MPLS-TP, IP, MPLS, Ethernet, ATM, Frame Relay, etc.)\n      \
    \   ([RFC5654], requirement 30).\n     28. The MPLS-TP control plane must provide\
    \ a generic and extensible\n         solution to support the transport of MPLS-TP\
    \ transport paths\n         over one or more server-layer networks (such as MPLS-TP,\n\
    \         Ethernet, Synchronous Optical Network / Synchronous Digital\n      \
    \   Hierarchy (SONET/SDH), Optical Transport Network (OTN), etc.).\n         Requirements\
    \ for bandwidth management within a server-layer\n         network are outside\
    \ the scope of this document ([RFC5654],\n         requirement 31).\n     29.\
    \ In an environment where an MPLS-TP layer network is supporting\n         a client-layer\
    \ network, and the MPLS-TP layer network is\n         supported by a server-layer\
    \ network, then the control-plane\n         operation of the MPLS-TP layer network\
    \ must be possible without\n         any dependencies on the server or client-layer\
    \ network\n         ([RFC5654], requirement 32).\n     30. The MPLS-TP control\
    \ plane must allow for the transport of a\n         client MPLS or MPLS-TP layer\
    \ network over a server MPLS or\n         MPLS-TP layer network ([RFC5654], requirement\
    \ 33).\n     31. The MPLS-TP control plane must allow the autonomous operation\n\
    \         of the layers of a multi-layer network that includes an MPLS-TP\n  \
    \       layer ([RFC5654], requirement 34).\n     32. The MPLS-TP control plane\
    \ must allow the hiding of MPLS-TP\n         layer network addressing and other\
    \ information (e.g., topology)\n         from client-layer networks.  However,\
    \ it should be possible, at\n         the option of the operator, to leak a limited\
    \ amount of\n         summarized information, such as Shared Risk Link Groups\
    \ (SRLGs)\n         or reachability, between layers ([RFC5654], requirement 35).\n\
    \     33. The MPLS-TP control plane must allow for the identification of\n   \
    \      a transport path on each link within and at the destination\n         (egress)\
    \ of the transport network ([RFC5654], requirements 38\n         and 39).\n  \
    \   34. The MPLS-TP control plane must allow for the use of P2MP server\n    \
    \     (sub-)layer capabilities as well as P2P server (sub-)layer\n         capabilities\
    \ when supporting P2MP MPLS-TP transport paths\n         ([RFC5654], requirement\
    \ 40).\n     35. The MPLS-TP control plane must be extensible in order to\n  \
    \       accommodate new types of client-layer networks and services\n        \
    \ ([RFC5654], requirement 41).\n     36. The MPLS-TP control plane should support\
    \ the reserved bandwidth\n         associated with a transport path to be increased\
    \ without\n         impacting the existing traffic on that transport path, provided\n\
    \         enough resources are available ([RFC5654], requirement 42)).\n     37.\
    \ The MPLS-TP control plane should support the reserved bandwidth\n         of\
    \ a transport path being decreased without impacting the\n         existing traffic\
    \ on that transport path, provided that the\n         level of existing traffic\
    \ is smaller than the reserved\n         bandwidth following the decrease ([RFC5654],\
    \ requirement 43).\n     38. The control plane for MPLS-TP must fit within the\
    \ ASON\n         (control-plane) architecture.  The ITU-T has defined an\n   \
    \      architecture for ASONs in G.8080 [ITU.G8080.2006] and G.8080\n        \
    \ Amendment 1 [ITU.G8080.2008].  An interpretation of the ASON\n         signaling\
    \ and routing requirements in the context of GMPLS can\n         be found in [RFC4139],\
    \ [RFC4258], and Section 2.4, paragraphs 2\n         and 3 of [RFC5654].\n   \
    \  39. The MPLS-TP control plane must support control-plane topology\n       \
    \  and data-plane topology independence ([RFC5654], requirement\n         47).\n\
    \     40. A failure of the MPLS-TP control plane must not interfere with\n   \
    \      the delivery of service or recovery of established transport\n        \
    \ paths ([RFC5654], requirement 47).\n     41. The MPLS-TP control plane must\
    \ be able to operate independent\n         of any particular client- or server-layer\
    \ control plane\n         ([RFC5654], requirement 48).\n     42. The MPLS-TP control\
    \ plane should support, but not require, an\n         integrated control plane\
    \ encompassing MPLS-TP together with its\n         server- and client-layer networks\
    \ when these layer networks\n         belong to the same administrative domain\
    \ ([RFC5654],\n         requirement 49).\n     43. The MPLS-TP control plane must\
    \ support configuration of\n         protection functions and any associated maintenance\
    \ (OAM)\n         functions ([RFC5654], requirements 50 and 7).\n     44. The\
    \ MPLS-TP control plane must support the configuration and\n         modification\
    \ of OAM maintenance points as well as the\n         activation/deactivation of\
    \ OAM when the transport path or\n         transport service is established or\
    \ modified ([RFC5654],\n         requirement 51).\n     45. The MPLS-TP control\
    \ plane must be capable of restarting and\n         relearning its previous state\
    \ without impacting forwarding\n         ([RFC5654], requirement 54).\n     46.\
    \ The MPLS-TP control plane must provide a mechanism for dynamic\n         ownership\
    \ transfer of the control of MPLS-TP transport paths\n         from the management\
    \ plane to the control plane and vice versa.\n         The number of reconfigurations\
    \ required in the data plane must\n         be minimized; preferably no data-plane\
    \ reconfiguration will be\n         required ([RFC5654], requirement 55).  Note,\
    \ such transfers\n         cover all transport path control functions including\
    \ control of\n         recovery and OAM.\n     47. The MPLS-TP control plane must\
    \ support protection and\n         restoration mechanisms, i.e., recovery ([RFC5654],\
    \ requirement\n         52).\n         Note that the MPLS-TP survivability framework\
    \ document\n         [RFC6372] provides additional useful information related\
    \ to\n         recovery.\n     48. The MPLS-TP control-plane mechanisms should\
    \ be identical (or as\n         similar as possible) to those already used in\
    \ existing\n         transport networks to simplify implementation and operations.\n\
    \         However, this must not override any other requirement\n         ([RFC5654],\
    \ requirement 56 A).\n     49. The MPLS-TP control-plane mechanisms used for P2P\
    \ and P2MP\n         recovery should be identical to simplify implementation and\n\
    \         operation.  However, this must not override any other\n         requirement\
    \ ([RFC5654], requirement 56 B).\n     50. The MPLS-TP control plane must support\
    \ recovery mechanisms that\n         are applicable at various levels throughout\
    \ the network\n         including support for link, transport path, segment,\n\
    \         concatenated segment, and end-to-end recovery ([RFC5654],\n        \
    \ requirement 57).\n     51. The MPLS-TP control plane must support recovery paths\
    \ that meet\n         the Service Level Agreement (SLA) protection objectives\
    \ of the\n         service ([RFC5654], requirement 58).  These include:\n    \
    \     a. Guarantee 50-ms recovery times from the moment of fault\n           \
    \ detection in networks with spans less than 1200 km.\n         b. Protection\
    \ of 100% of the traffic on the protected path.\n         c. Recovery must meet\
    \ SLA requirements over multiple domains.\n     52. The MPLS-TP control plane\
    \ should support per-transport-path\n         recovery objectives ([RFC5654],\
    \ requirement 59).\n     53. The MPLS-TP control plane must support recovery mechanisms\
    \ that\n         are applicable to any topology ([RFC5654], requirement 60).\n\
    \     54. The MPLS-TP control plane must operate in synergy with\n         (including\
    \ coordination of timing/timer settings) the recovery\n         mechanisms present\
    \ in any client or server transport networks\n         (for example, Ethernet,\
    \ SDH, OTN, Wavelength Division\n         Multiplexing (WDM)) to avoid race conditions\
    \ between the layers\n         ([RFC5654], requirement 61).\n     55. The MPLS-TP\
    \ control plane must support recovery and reversion\n         mechanisms that\
    \ prevent frequent operation of recovery in the\n         event of an intermittent\
    \ defect ([RFC5654], requirement 62).\n     56. The MPLS-TP control plane must\
    \ support revertive and non-\n         revertive protection behavior ([RFC5654],\
    \ requirement 64).\n     57. The MPLS-TP control plane must support 1+1 bidirectional\n\
    \         protection for P2P transport paths ([RFC5654], requirement 65\n    \
    \     A).\n     58. The MPLS-TP control plane must support 1+1 unidirectional\n\
    \         protection for P2P transport paths ([RFC5654], requirement 65\n    \
    \     B).\n     59. The MPLS-TP control plane must support 1+1 unidirectional\n\
    \         protection for P2MP transport paths ([RFC5654], requirement 65\n   \
    \      C).\n     60. The MPLS-TP control plane must support the ability to share\n\
    \         protection resources amongst a number of transport paths\n         ([RFC5654],\
    \ requirement 66).\n     61. The MPLS-TP control plane must support 1:n bidirectional\n\
    \         protection for P2P transport paths.  Bidirectional 1:n\n         protection\
    \ should be the default for 1:n protection ([RFC5654],\n         requirement 67\
    \ A).\n     62. The MPLS-TP control plane must support 1:n unidirectional\n  \
    \       protection for P2MP transport paths ([RFC5654], requirement 67\n     \
    \    B).\n     63. The MPLS-TP control plane may support 1:n unidirectional\n\
    \         protection for P2P transport paths ([RFC5654], requirement 65\n    \
    \     C).\n     64. The MPLS-TP control plane may support the control of extra-\n\
    \         traffic type traffic ([RFC5654], note after requirement 67).\n     65.\
    \ The MPLS-TP control plane should support 1:n (including 1:1)\n         shared\
    \ mesh recovery ([RFC5654], requirement 68).\n     66. The MPLS-TP control plane\
    \ must support sharing of protection\n         resources such that protection\
    \ paths that are known not to be\n         required concurrently can share the\
    \ same resources ([RFC5654],\n         requirement 69).\n     67. The MPLS-TP\
    \ control plane must support the sharing of resources\n         between a restoration\
    \ transport path and the transport path\n         being replaced ([RFC5654], requirement\
    \ 70).\n     68. The MPLS-TP control plane must support restoration priority so\n\
    \         that an implementation can determine the order in which\n         transport\

- title: 3. Relationship of PWs and TE LSPs
  contents:
  - "3. Relationship of PWs and TE LSPs\n   The data-plane relationship between PWs\
    \ and LSPs is inherited from\n   standard MPLS and is reviewed in the MPLS-TP\
    \ framework [RFC5921].\n   Likewise, the control-plane relationship between PWs\
    \ and LSPs is\n   inherited from standard MPLS.  This relationship is reviewed\
    \ in this\n   document.  The relationship between the PW and LSP control planes\
    \ in\n   MPLS-TP is the same as the relationship found in the PWE3 Maintenance\n\
    \   Reference Model as presented in the PWE3 architecture; see Figure 6\n   of\
    \ [RFC3985].  The PWE3 architecture [RFC3985] states: \"The PWE3\n   protocol-layering\
    \ model is intended to minimize the differences\n   between PWs operating over\
    \ different PSN types\".  Additionally, PW\n   control (maintenance) takes place\
    \ separately from LSP signaling.\n   [RFC4447] and [MS-PW-DYNAMIC] provide such\
    \ extensions for the use of\n   LDP as the control plane for PWs.  This control\
    \ can provide PW\n   control without providing LSP control.\n   In the context\
    \ of MPLS-TP, LSP tunnel signaling is provided via GMPLS\n   RSVP-TE.  While RSVP-TE\
    \ could be extended to support PW control much\n   as LDP was extended in [RFC4447],\
    \ such extensions are out of scope of\n   this document.  This means that the\
    \ control of PWs and LSPs will\n   operate largely independently.  The main coordination\
    \ between LSP and\n   PW control will occur within the nodes that terminate PWs\
    \ or PW\n   segments.  See Section 5.3.2 for an additional discussion on such\n\
    \   coordination.\n   It is worth noting that the control planes for PWs and LSPs\
    \ may be\n   used independently, and that one may be employed without the other.\n\
    \   This translates into four possible scenarios: (1) no control plane is\n  \
    \ employed; (2) a control plane is used for both LSPs and PWs; (3) a\n   control\
    \ plane is used for LSPs, but not PWs; (4) a control plane is\n   used for PWs,\
    \ but not LSPs.\n   The PW and LSP control planes, collectively, must satisfy\
    \ the MPLS-TP\n   control-plane requirements reviewed in this document.  When\
    \ client\n   services are provided directly via LSPs, all requirements must be\n\
    \   satisfied by the LSP control plane.  When client services are\n   provided\
    \ via PWs, the PW and LSP control planes can operate in\n   combination, and some\
    \ functions may be satisfied via the PW control\n   plane while others are provided\
    \ to PWs by the LSP control plane.  For\n   example, to support the recovery functions\
    \ described in [RFC6372],\n   this document focuses on the control of the recovery\
    \ functions at the\n   LSP layer.  PW-based recovery is under development at this\

  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  In-Band and Out-of-Band Control\n   GMPLS supports both in-band and out-of-band\
    \ control.  The terms \"in-\n   band\" and \"out-of-band\", in the context of\
    \ this document, refer to\n   the relationship of the control plane relative to\
    \ the management and\n   data planes.  The terms may be used to refer to the control\
    \ plane\n   independent of the management plane, or to both of them in concert.\n\
    \   The remainder of this section describes the relationship of the\n   control\
    \ plane to the management and data planes.\n   There are multiple uses of both\
    \ terms \"in-band\" and \"out-of-band\".\n   The terms may relate to a channel,\
    \ a path, or a network.  Each of\n   these can be used independently or in combination.\
    \  Briefly, some\n   typical usage of the terms is as follows:\n   o  In-band\n\
    \      This term is used to refer to cases where control-plane traffic is\n  \
    \    sent in the same communication channel used to transport\n      associated\
    \ user data or management traffic.  IP, MPLS, and\n      Ethernet networks are\
    \ all examples where control traffic is\n      typically sent in-band with the\
    \ data traffic.  An example of this\n      case in the context of MPLS-TP is where\
    \ control-plane traffic is\n      sent via the MPLS Generic Associated Channel\
    \ (G-ACh), see\n      [RFC5586], using the same LSP as controlled user traffic.\n\
    \   o  Out-of-band, in-fiber (same physical connection)\n      This term is used\
    \ to refer to cases where control-plane traffic is\n      sent using a different\
    \ communication channel from the associated\n      data or management traffic,\
    \ and the control communication channel\n      resides in the same fiber as either\
    \ the management or data\n      traffic.  An example of this case in the context\
    \ of MPLS-TP is\n      where control-plane traffic is sent via the G-ACh using\
    \ a\n      dedicated LSP on the same link (interface) that carries controlled\n\
    \      user traffic.\n   o  Out-of-band, aligned topology\n      This term is\
    \ used to refer to the cases where control-plane\n      traffic is sent using\
    \ a different communication channel from the\n      associated data or management\
    \ traffic, and the control traffic\n      follows the same node-to-node path as\
    \ either the data or\n      management traffic.\n      Such topologies are usually\
    \ supported using a parallel fiber or\n      other configurations where multiple\
    \ data channels are available\n      and one is (dynamically) selected as the\
    \ control channel.  An\n      example of this case in the context of MPLS-TP is\
    \ where control-\n      plane traffic is sent along the same nodal path, but not\n\
    \      necessarily the same links (interfaces), as the corresponding\n      controlled\
    \ user traffic.\n   o  Out-of-band, independent topology\n      This term is used\
    \ to refer to the cases where control-plane\n      traffic is sent using a different\
    \ communication channel from the\n      associated data or management traffic,\
    \ and the control traffic may\n      follow a path that is completely independent\
    \ of the data traffic.\n      Such configurations are a superset of the other\
    \ cases and do not\n      preclude the use of in-fiber or aligned topology links,\
    \ but\n      alignment is not required.  An example of this case in the context\n\
    \      of MPLS-TP is where control-plane traffic is sent between\n      controlling\
    \ nodes using any available path and links, completely\n      without regard for\
    \ the path(s) taken by corresponding management\n      or user traffic.\n   In\
    \ the context of MPLS-TP requirements, requirement 14 (see Section 2\n   above)\
    \ can be met using out-of-band in-fiber or aligned topology\n   types of control.\
    \  Requirement 15 can only be met by using out-of-\n   band, independent topology.\
    \  G-ACh is likely to be used extensively\n   in MPLS-TP networks to support the\
    \ MPLS-TP control (and management)\n   planes.\n"

    \  The address spaces and neighbor adjacencies\n   in the control, management,\

    \ use a different address family.  It is even possible to reuse\n   addresses\

    \ describes how MPLS labels may be stacked so that LSPs may\n   be nested with\
    \ one LSP running through another.  This concept of\n   hierarchical LSPs (H-LSPs)\
    \ is formalized in [RFC4206] with a set of\n   protocol mechanisms for the establishment\
    \ of a hierarchical LSP that\n   can carry one or more other LSPs.\n   [RFC4206]\
    \ goes on to explain that a hierarchical LSP may carry other\n   LSPs only according\
    \ to their switching types.  This is a function of\n   the way labels are carried.\
    \  In a packet switch capable network, the\n   hierarchical LSP can carry other\
    \ packet switch capable LSPs using the\n   MPLS label stack.\n   Signaling mechanisms\
    \ defined in [RFC4206] allow a hierarchical LSP to\n   be treated as a single\
    \ hop in the path of another LSP.  This\n   mechanism is also sometimes known\
    \ as \"non-adjacent signaling\", see\n   [RFC4208].\n   A Forwarding Adjacency\

    \ in the same instance of the\n   control plane that advertises the TE links from\

    \ are\n   analogous to MPLS-TP Sections as discussed in [RFC5960].\n   Thus, a\
    \ hierarchical LSP may form an FA such that it is advertised as\n   a TE link\
    \ in the same instance of the routing protocol as was used to\n   advertise the\
    \ TE links that the LSP traverses.\n   As observed in [RFC4206], the nodes at\

  contents:
  - "4.1.10.  Control-Plane Reference Points (E-NNI, I-NNI, UNI)\n   The majority\
    \ of RFCs about the GMPLS control plane define the control\n   plane from the\
    \ context of an internal Network-to-Network Interface\n   (I-NNI).  In the MPLS-TP\
    \ context, some operators may choose to deploy\n   signaled interfaces across\
    \ User-to-Network Interfaces (UNIs) and\n   across inter-provider, external Network-to-Network\
    \ Interfaces\n   (E-NNIs).  Such support is embodied in [RFC4208] for UNIs and\
    \ in\n   [RFC5787] for routing areas in support of E-NNIs.  This work may\n  \
    \ require extensions in order to meet the specific needs of an MPLS-TP\n   UNI\
    \ and E-NNI.\n"
- title: 4.2.  OAM, MEP (Hierarchy), MIP Configuration and Control
  contents:
  - "4.2.  OAM, MEP (Hierarchy), MIP Configuration and Control\n   MPLS-TP is defined\
    \ to support a comprehensive set of MPLS-TP OAM\n   functions.  The MPLS-TP control\
    \ plane will not itself provide OAM\n   functions, but it will be used to instantiate\
    \ and otherwise control\n   MPLS-TP OAM functions.\n   Specific OAM requirements\
    \ for MPLS-TP are documented in [RFC5860].\n   This document also states that\
    \ it is required that the control plane\n   be able to configure and control OAM\
    \ entities.  This requirement is\n   not yet addressed by the existing RFCs, but\
    \ such work is now under\n   way, e.g., [CCAMP-OAM-FWK] and [CCAMP-OAM-EXT].\n\
    \   Many OAM functions occur on a per-LSP basis, are typically in-band,\n   and\
    \ are initiated immediately after LSP establishment.  Hence, it is\n   desirable\
    \ that such functions be established and activated via the\n   same control-plane\
    \ signaling used to set up the LSP, as this\n   effectively synchronizes OAM with\
    \ the LSP lifetime and avoids the\n   extra overhead and potential errors associated\
    \ with separate OAM\n   configuration mechanisms.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Management-Plane Support\n   There is no MPLS-TP requirement for a standardized\
    \ management\n   interface to the MPLS-TP control plane.  That said, MPLS and\
    \ GMPLS\n   support a number of standardized management functions.  These include\n\
    \   the MPLS-TE/GMPLS TE Database Management Information Base [TE-MIB];\n   the\
    \ MPLS-TE MIB [RFC3812]; the MPLS LSR MIB [RFC3813]; the GMPLS TE\n   MIB [RFC4802];\
    \ and the GMPLS LSR MIB [RFC4803].  These MIB modules\n   may be used in MPLS-TP\
    \ networks.  A general overview of MPLS-TP\n   related MIB modules can be found\
    \ in [TP-MIB].  Network management\n   requirements for MPLS-based transport networks\

  contents:

    \ recovery triggers\n   and directly supports control-plane recovery triggers.\
    \  Support for\n   control-plane recovery triggers is defined in [RFC4872], which\
    \ refers\n   to the triggers as \"Recovery Commands\".  These commands can be\
    \ used\n   with both end-to-end and segment recovery, but are always controlled\n\
    \   on an end-to-end basis.  The recovery triggers/commands defined in\n   [RFC4872]\
    \ are:\n      a. Lockout of recovery LSP\n      b. Lockout of normal traffic\n\
    \      c. Forced switch for normal traffic\n      d. Requested switch for normal\
    \ traffic\n      e. Requested switch for recovery LSP\n   Note that control-plane\

- title: 4.2.1.2.  Management-Plane / Control-Plane Ownership Transfer
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.2.  Management-Plane / Control-Plane Ownership Transfer\n   In networks\
    \ where both the control plane and management plane are\n   provided, LSP provisioning\
    \ can be done either by the control plane or\n   management plane.  As mentioned\
    \ in the requirements section above, it\n   must be possible to transfer, or handover,\
    \ a management-plane-created\n   LSP to the control-plane domain and vice versa.\
    \  [RFC5493] defines\n   the specific requirements for an LSP ownership handover\
    \ procedure.\n   It must be possible for the control plane to provide the management\n\
    \   plane, in a reliable manner, with the status or result of an\n   operation\
    \ performed by the management plane.  This notification may\n   be either synchronous\
    \ or asynchronous with respect to the operation.\n   Moreover, it must be possible\
    \ for the management plane to monitor the\n   status of the control plane, for\
    \ example, the status of a TE link,\n   its available resources, etc.  This monitoring\
    \ may be based on\n   queries initiated by the management plane or on notifications\n\
    \   generated by the control plane.  A mechanism must be made available\n   by\
    \ the control plane to the management plane to log operation of a\n   control-plane\
    \ LSP; that is, it must be possible from the NMS to have\n   a clear view of the\
    \ life (traffic hit, action performed, signaling,\n   etc.) of a given LSP.  The\
    \ LSP handover procedure for MPLS-TP LSPs is\n   supported via [RFC5852].\n"

    \ function is expected in the data plane to\n   support the interconnection of\
    \ MPLS-TE and MPLS-TP networking, this\n   is not the case for the control plane.\
    \  MPLS-TE networks typically\n   use LSP signaling based on [RFC3209], while\
    \ MPLS-TP LSPs will be\n   signaled using GMPLS RSVP-TE, i.e., [RFC3473].  [RFC5145]\

    \ also requires support for\n   associated bidirectional point-to-point LSPs.\

    \ LSP end points\n   supporting an associated bidirectional service will coordinate\
    \ the\n   two LSPs used to provide such a service.  Per requirement 11, transit\n\
    \   nodes that support an associated bidirectional service should be\n   aware\
    \ of the association of the LSPs used to support the service when\n   both LSPs\
    \ are supported on that transit node.  There are several\n   existing protocol\
    \ mechanisms on which to base such support,\n   including, but not limited to:\n\
    \      o  GMPLS calls [RFC4974].\n      o  The ASSOCIATION object [RFC4872].\n\

  contents:
  - "5.1.  LDP Functions and Pseudowires\n   MPLS PWs are defined in [RFC3985] and\
    \ [RFC5659], and provide for\n   emulated services over an MPLS Packet Switched\
    \ Network (PSN).\n   Several types of PWs have been defined: (1) Ethernet PWs\
    \ providing\n   for Ethernet port or Ethernet VLAN transport over MPLS [RFC4448],\
    \ (2)\n   High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) / PPP PW providing for HDLC/PPP\n\
    \   leased line transport over MPLS [RFC4618], (3) ATM PWs [RFC4816], (4)\n  \
    \ Frame Relay PWs [RFC4619], and (5) circuit Emulation PWs [RFC4553].\n   Today's\
    \ transport networks based on Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy\n   (PDH), WDM,\
    \ or SONET/SDH provide transport for PDH or SONET (e.g.,\n   ATM over SONET or\
    \ Packet PPP over SONET) client signals with no\n   payload awareness.  Implementing\
    \ PW capability allows for the use of\n   an existing technology to substitute\
    \ the Time-Division Multiplexing\n   (TDM) transport with packet-based transport,\
    \ using well-defined PW\n   encapsulation methods for carrying various packet\
    \ services over MPLS,\n   and providing for potentially better bandwidth utilization.\n\
    \   There are two general classes of PWs: (1) Single-Segment Pseudowires\n   (SS-PWs)\
    \ [RFC3985] and (2) Multi-segment Pseudowires (MS-PWs)\n   [RFC5659].  An MPLS-TP\
    \ network domain may transparently transport a\n   PW whose end points are within\
    \ a client network.  Alternatively, an\n   MPLS-TP edge node may be the Terminating\
    \ PE (T-PE) for a PW,\n   performing adaptation from the native attachment circuit\
    \ technology\n   (e.g., Ethernet 802.1Q) to an MPLS PW that is then transported\
    \ in an\n   LSP over an MPLS-TP network.  In this way, the PW is analogous to\
    \ a\n   transport channel in a TDM network, and the LSP is equivalent to a\n \
    \  container of multiple non-concatenated channels, albeit they are\n   packet\
    \ containers.  An MPLS-TP network may also contain Switching PEs\n   (S-PEs) for\
    \ a Multi-Segment PW whereby the T-PEs may be at the edge\n   of an MPLS-TP network\
    \ or in a client network.  In the latter case, a\n   T-PE in a client network\
    \ performs the adaptation of the native\n   service to MPLS and the MPLS-TP network\
    \ performs pseudowire\n   switching.\n   The SS-PW signaling control plane is\
    \ based on targeted LDP (T-LDP)\n   with specific procedures defined in [RFC4447].\
    \  The MS-PW signaling\n   control plane is also based on T-LDP as allowed for\
    \ in [RFC5659],\n   [RFC6073], and [MS-PW-DYNAMIC].  An MPLS-TP network shall\
    \ use the\n   same PW signaling protocols and procedures for placing SS-PWs and\n\
    \   MS-PWs.  This will leverage existing technology as well as facilitate\n  \
    \ interoperability with client networks with native attachment circuits\n   or\
    \ PW segments that are switched across an MPLS-TP network.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.3.  Anticipated MPLS-TP-Related Extensions\n   Existing control protocol and\
    \ procedures will be reused as much as\n   possible to support MPLS-TP.  However,\
    \ when using PWs in MPLS-TP, a\n   set of new requirements is defined that may\
    \ require extensions of the\n   existing control mechanisms.  This section clarifies\
    \ the areas where\n   extensions are needed based on the requirements that are\
    \ related to\n   the PW control plane and documented in [RFC5654].\n   Table 2\
    \ lists how requirements defined in [RFC5654] are expected to\n   be addressed.\n\
    \   The baseline requirement for extensions to support transport\n   applications\
    \ is that any new mechanisms and capabilities must be able\n   to interoperate\
    \ with existing IETF MPLS [RFC3031] and IETF PWE3\n   [RFC3985] control and data\
    \ planes where appropriate.  Hence,\n   extensions of the PW control plane must\

- title: 5.3.1.  Extensions to Support Out-of-Band PW Control
  contents:
  - "5.3.1.  Extensions to Support Out-of-Band PW Control\n   For MPLS-TP, it is required\
    \ that the data and control planes can be\n   both logically and physically separated.\
    \  That is, the PW control\n   plane must be able to operate out-of-band (OOB).\
    \  This separation\n   ensures, among other things, that in the case of control-plane\n\
    \   failures the data plane is not affected and can continue to operate\n   normally.\
    \  This was not a design requirement for the current PW\n   control plane.  However,\
    \ due to the PW concept, i.e., PWs are\n   connecting logical entities ('forwarders'),\
    \ and the operation of the\n   PW control protocol, i.e., only edge PE nodes (T-PE,\
    \ S-PE) take part\n   in the signaling exchanges: moving T-LDP out-of-band seems\
    \ to be,\n   theoretically, a straightforward exercise.\n   In fact, as a strictly\
    \ local matter, ensuring that targeted LDP\n   (T-LDP) uses out-of-band signaling\
    \ requires only that the local\n   implementation is configured in such a way\
    \ that reachability for a\n   target LSR address is via the out-of-band channel.\n\
    \   More precisely, if IP addressing is used in the MPLS-TP control\n   plane,\
    \ then T-LDP addressing can be maintained, although all\n   addresses will refer\
    \ to control-plane entities.  Both the PWid\n   Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)\
    \ and Generalized PWid FEC Elements\n   can possibly be used in an OOB case as\
    \ well.  (Detailed evaluation is\n   outside the scope of this document.)  The\
    \ PW label allocation and\n   exchange mechanisms should be reused without change.\n"
- title: 5.3.2.  Support for Explicit Control of PW-to-LSP Binding
  contents:
  - "5.3.2.  Support for Explicit Control of PW-to-LSP Binding\n   Binding a PW to\
    \ an LSP, or PW segments to LSPs, is left to nodes\n   acting as T-PEs and S-PEs\
    \ or a control-plane entity that may be the\n   same one signaling the PW.  However,\
    \ an extension of the PW signaling\n   protocol is required to allow the LSR at\
    \ the signal initiation end to\n   inform the targeted LSR (at the signal termination\
    \ end) to which LSP\n   the resulting PW is to be bound, in the event that more\
    \ than one such\n   LSP exists and the choice of LSPs is important to the service\
    \ being\n   setup (for example, if the service requires co-routed bidirectional\n\
    \   paths).  This is also particularly important to support transport\n   path\
    \ (symmetric and asymmetric) bandwidth requirements.\n   For transport services,\
    \ MPLS-TP requires support for bidirectional\n   traffic that follows congruent\
    \ paths.  Currently, each direction of a\n   PW or a PW segment is bound to a\
    \ unidirectional LSP that extends\n   between two T-PEs, two S-PEs, or a T-PE\
    \ and an S-PE.  The\n   unidirectional LSPs in both directions are not required\
    \ to follow\n   congruent paths, and therefore both directions of a PW may not\
    \ follow\n   congruent paths, i.e., they are associated bidirectional paths. \
    \ The\n   only requirement in [RFC5659] is that a PW or a PW segment shares the\n\
    \   same T-PEs in both directions and the same S-PEs in both directions.\n   MPLS-TP\
    \ imposes new requirements on the PW control plane, in\n   requiring that both\
    \ end points map the PW or PW segment to the same\n   transport path for the case\
    \ where this is an objective of the\n   service.  When a bidirectional LSP is\
    \ selected on one end to\n   transport the PW, a mechanism is needed that signals\
    \ to the remote\n   end which LSP has been selected locally to transport the PW.\
    \  This\n   would be accomplished by adding a new TLV to PW signaling.\n   Note\
    \ that this coincides with the gap identified for OOB support: a\n   new mechanism\
    \ is needed to allow explicit binding of a PW to the\n   supporting transport\
    \ LSP.\n   The case of unidirectional transport paths may also require\n   additional\
    \ protocol mechanisms, as today's PWs are always\n   bidirectional.  One potential\
    \ approach for providing a unidirectional\n   PW-based transport path is for the\
    \ PW to associate different\n   (asymmetric) bandwidths in each direction, with\
    \ a zero or minimal\n   bandwidth for the return path.  This approach is consistent\
    \ with\n   Section 3.8.2 of [RFC5921] but does not address P2MP paths.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.3.4.  Interoperable Support for PW/LSP Resource Allocation\n   Transport applications\
    \ may require resource guarantees.  For such\n   transport LSPs, resource reservation\
    \ mechanisms are provided via\n   RSVP-TE and the use of Diffserv.  If multiple\
    \ PWs are multiplexed\n   into the same transport LSP resources, contention may\
    \ occur.\n   However, local policy at PEs should ensure proper resource sharing\n\
    \   among PWs mapped into a resource-guaranteed LSP.  In the case of\n   MS-PWs,\
    \ signaling carries the PW traffic parameters [MS-PW-DYNAMIC]\n   to enable admission\
    \ control of a PW segment over a resource-\n   guaranteed LSP.\n   In conjunction\
    \ with explicit PW-to-LSP binding, existing mechanisms\n   may be sufficient;\
    \ however, this needs to be verified in detailed\n   evaluation.\n"
- title: 5.3.5.  Support for PW Protection and PW OAM Configuration
  contents:
  - "5.3.5.  Support for PW Protection and PW OAM Configuration\n   Many of the requirements\
    \ listed in Section 2 are intended to support\n   connectivity and performance\
    \ monitoring (grouped together as OAM), as\n   well as protection conformant with\
    \ the transport services model.\n   In general, protection of MPLS-TP transported\
    \ services is provided by\n   way of protection of transport LSPs.  PW protection\
    \ requires that\n   mechanisms be defined to support redundant pseudowires, including\
    \ a\n   mechanism already described above for associating such pseudowires\n \
    \  with specific protected (\"working\" and \"protection\") LSPs.  Also\n   required\
    \ are definitions of local protection control functions, to\n   include test/verification\
    \ operations, and protection status signals\n   needed to ensure that PW termination\
    \ points are in agreement as to\n   which of a set of redundant pseudowires are\
    \ in use for which\n   transport services at any given point in time.\n   Much\
    \ of this work is currently being done in documents [PW-RED] and\n   [PW-REDB]\
    \ that define, respectively, how to establish redundant\n   pseudowires and how\
    \ to indicate which is in use.  Additional work may\n   be required.\n   Protection\
    \ switching may be triggered manually by the operator, or as\n   a result of loss\
    \ of connectivity (detected using the mechanisms of\n   [RFC5085] and [RFC5586]),\
    \ or service degradation (detected using\n   mechanisms yet to be defined).\n\
    \   Automated protection switching is just one of the functions for which\n  \
    \ a transport service requires OAM.  OAM is generally referred to as\n   either\
    \ \"proactive\" or \"on-demand\", where the distinction is whether a\n   specific\
    \ OAM tool is being used continuously over time (for the\n   purpose of detecting\
    \ a need for protection switching, for example) or\n   is only used -- either\
    \ a limited number of times or over a short\n   period of time -- when explicitly\
    \ enabled (for diagnostics, for\n   example).\n   PW OAM currently consists of\
    \ connectivity verification defined by\n   [RFC5085].  Work is currently in progress\
    \ to extend PW OAM to include\n   bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) in\
    \ [RFC5885], and work has\n   begun on extending BFD to include performance-related\
    \ monitor\n   functions.\n"
