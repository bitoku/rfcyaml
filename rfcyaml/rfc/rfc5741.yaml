- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Previously, RFCs (e.g., [RFC4844]) contained a number of\
    \ elements\n   that were there for historical, practical, and legal reasons. \
    \ They\n   also contained boilerplate material to clearly indicate the status\
    \ of\n   the document and possibly contained \"Notes\" to indicate how the\n \
    \  document interacts with IETF Standards Track documents.\n   As the RFC Series\
    \ has evolved over the years, there has been\n   increasing concern over appropriate\
    \ labeling of the publications to\n   make clear the status of each RFC and the\
    \ status of the work it\n   describes.  Chiefly, there is a requirement that RFCs\
    \ published as\n   part of the IETF's review process not be easily confused with\
    \ RFCs\n   that may have had a very different review and approval process.\n \
    \  Various adjustments have been made over the years, including evolving\n   text\
    \ of \"Notes\" included in the published RFC.\n   With the definition of the different\
    \ RFC streams [RFC4844], it is\n   appropriate to formalize the definition of\
    \ the various pieces of\n   standard RFC boilerplate and introduce some adjustments\
    \ to ensure\n   better clarity of expression of document status, aligned with\
    \ the\n   review and approval processes defined for each stream.\n   This memo\
    \ identifies and describes the common elements of RFC\n   boilerplate structure,\
    \ and provides a comprehensive approach to\n   updating and using those elements\
    \ to communicate, with clarity, RFC\n   document and content status.  Most of\
    \ the historical structure\n   information is collected from [RFC2223].\n   The\
    \ changes introduced by this memo should be implemented as soon as\n   practically\
    \ possible after the document has been approved for\n   publication.\n"
- title: 2.  RFC Streams and Internet Standards
  contents:
  - "2.  RFC Streams and Internet Standards\n   Users of RFCs should be aware that\
    \ while all Internet Standards-\n   related documents are published as RFCs, not\
    \ all RFCs are Internet\n   Standards-related documents.\n   The IETF is responsible\
    \ for maintaining the Internet Standards\n   Process, which includes the requirements\
    \ for developing, reviewing,\n   and approving Standards Track and BCP RFCs. \
    \ The IETF also produces\n   non-Standards-Track documents (Informational, Experimental,\
    \ and\n   Historic).  All documents published as part of the IETF Stream are\n\
    \   reviewed by the appropriate IETF bodies.\n   Documents published in streams\
    \ other than the IETF Stream are not\n   generally reviewed by the IETF for such\
    \ things as security,\n   congestion control, or inappropriate interaction with\
    \ deployed\n   protocols.  They have also not been subject to approval by the\n\
    \   Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), including an IETF-wide\n   last\
    \ call.  Therefore, the IETF disclaims, for any of the non-IETF\n   Stream documents,\
    \ any knowledge of the fitness of those RFCs for any\n   purpose.\n   Refer to\
    \ [RFC2026], [RFC5742], and [RFC4844] and their successors for\n   current details\
    \ of the IETF process and RFC streams.\n"

    \   intended to specify a single, static format.  Details of formatting\n   are\
    \ decided by the RFC Editor.  Substantive changes to the header and\n   boilerplate\
    \ structure and content may be undertaken in the future,\n   and are subject to\

    \ The right column contains author name and affiliation information as\n   well\
    \ as the RFC publication month.  Conventions and restrictions for\n   these elements\
    \ are described in RFC style norms and some individual\n   stream definitions.\n\
    \   This section is primarily concerned with the information in the left\n   column:\n\
    \   <document source>\n      This describes the area where the work originates.\
    \  Historically,\n      all RFCs were labeled Network Working Group.  \"Network\
    \ Working\n      Group\" refers to the original version of today's IETF when people\n\
    \      from the original set of ARPANET sites and whomever else was\n      interested\
    \ -- the meetings were open -- got together to discuss,\n      design, and document\
    \ proposed protocols [RFC0003].  Here, we\n      obsolete the term \"Network Working\
    \ Group\" in order to indicate the\n      originating stream.\n      The <document\
    \ source> is the name of the RFC stream, as defined in\n      [RFC4844] and its\
    \ successors.  At the time of this publication,\n      the streams, and therefore\
    \ the possible entries are:\n      *  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\n\
    \      *  Internet Architecture Board (IAB)\n      *  Internet Research Task Force\
    \ (IRTF)\n      *  Independent Submission\n   Request for Comments: <RFC number>\n\
    \      This indicates the RFC number, assigned by the RFC Editor upon\n      publication\
    \ of the document.  This element is unchanged.\n   <subseries ID> <subseries number>\n\
    \      Some document categories are also labeled as a subseries of RFCs.\n   \
    \   These elements appear as appropriate for such categories,\n      indicating\
    \ the subseries and the documents number within that\n      series.  Currently,\
    \ there are subseries for BCPs [RFC2026], STDs\n      [RFC1311], and FYIs [RFC1150].\
    \  These subseries numbers may appear\n      in several RFCs.  For example, when\
    \ a new RFC obsoletes or updates\n      an old one, the same subseries number\
    \ is used.  Also, several RFCs\n      may be assigned the same subseries number:\
    \ a single STD, for\n      example, may be composed of several RFCs, each of which\
    \ will bear\n      the same STD number.  This element is unchanged.\n   [<RFC\
    \ relation>: <RFC number[s]>]\n      Some relations between RFCs in the series\
    \ are explicitly noted in\n      the RFC header.  For example, a new RFC may update\
    \ one or more\n      earlier RFCs.  Currently two relationships are defined: \"\
    Updates\"\n      and \"Obsoletes\" [RFC2223].  Alternatives like \"Obsoleted by\"\
    \ are\n      also used (e.g., in [RFC5143]).  Other types of relationships may\n\
    \      be defined by the RFC Editor and may appear in future RFCs.\n   Category:\
    \ <category>\n      This indicates the initial RFC document category of the\n\
    \      publication.  These are defined in [RFC2026].  Currently, this is\n   \
    \   always one of: Standards Track, Best Current Practice,\n      Experimental,\
    \ Informational, or Historic.  This element is\n      unchanged.\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document tries to clarify the descriptions\
    \ of the status of an\n   RFC.  Misunderstanding the status of a memo could cause\n\
    \   interoperability problems, hence security and stability problems.\n"
- title: 5.  RFC Editor Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  RFC Editor Considerations\n   The RFC Editor is responsible for maintaining\
    \ the consistency of the\n   RFC series.  To that end the RFC Editor maintains\
    \ a style manual\n   [RFC-style].  In this memo we mention a few explicit structural\n\
    \   elements that the RFC Editor needs to maintain.  The conventions for\n   the\
    \ content and use of all current and future elements are to be\n   documented\
    \ in the style manual.\n   Adding a reference to the stream in the header of RFCs\
    \ is only one\n   method for clarifying from which stream an RFC originated. \
    \ The RFC\n   Editor is encouraged to add such indication in e.g., indices and\n\
    \   interfaces.\n"
