  - "Abstract\n   Working Party 1/2, of the International Telecommunication Union\n\
    \   Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) held a meeting of\n   its\
    \ collaborators in Berlin Germany 19-26 October 2000.  The agenda\n   of the meeting\
    \ contained several contributions regarding RFC 2916:\n   \"E.164 Number and DNS\"\
    \ from the Internet Engineering Task Force's\n   (IETF) ENUM Working Group - more\
    \ specifically, the method for\n   administering and maintaining the E.164-based\
    \ resources in the Domain\n   Name System (DNS) as related to the ENUM protocol.\
    \  Consequently, in\n   addition to the WP1/2 collaborators, there were several\
    \ members of\n   the IETF present to assist with the discussion of issues contained\
    \ in\n   the aforementioned contributions.\n   This liaison from WP1/2 to the\
    \ IETF/ISOC conveys the understandings\n   of the WP1/2 collaborators resulting\
    \ from the discussions.\n"
- title: 1. Considerations under Question 1/2 (Numbering)
  contents:
  - "1. Considerations under Question 1/2 (Numbering)\n   Throughout this document,\
    \ the terms \"administration\" or\n   \"administrative functions\" refer to the\
    \ provision and update of the\n   E.164 numerical values, to be contained in the\
    \ zones of a domain name\n   in the \"e164.arpa\" domain, in the DNS.\n   It is\
    \ noted that most ENUM service and administrative decisions are\n   national issues\
    \ under the purview of ITU Member States, since most of\n   the E.164 resources\
    \ are utilized nationally.\n   These understandings are relative only to the provision\
    \ of E.164\n   information for DNS administrative functions, not policy or\n \
    \  operational functions.\n   In order to advance a common terminology for the\
    \ purpose of this\n   liaison, we have defined the zones of a domain name as follows.\n\
    \   Using an example, domain name \"1.5.1.5.0.2.0.4.1.3.3.e164.arpa\" (as\n  \
    \ in RFC 2916) is segmented into zones as follow:\n      E164.arpa - domain zone\n\
    \      3.3. - country code zone (1, 2, or 3 digits dependent on CC)\n      1.5.1.5.0.2.0.4.1.\
    \ - national zone\n   The first understandings to be conveyed are those regarding\
    \ the\n   responsibilities for administration of the various zones within the\n\
    \   \"e164.arpa\" domain:\n   o  The domain zone administration was agreed to\
    \ be outside the scope\n      of this meeting and WP1/2.\n   o  For all E.164\
    \ Country Code Zone resources (Country Codes and\n      Identification Codes),\
    \ the ITU has the responsibility to provide\n      assignment information to DNS\
    \ administrators, for performing the\n      administrative function.  The ITU\
    \ will ensure that each Member\n      State has authorized the inclusion of their\
    \ Country Code\n      information for input to the DNS.  For resources that are\
    \ spare or\n      designated as test codes there will normally be no entry in\
    \ the\n      DNS.  However, the ITU will provide spare code lists to DNS\n   \
    \   administrators for purposes of clarification.  The entity to which\n     \
    \ E.164 test codes have been assigned will be responsible for\n      providing\
    \ any appropriate assignment information to DNS\n      administrators.\n   o \
    \ The administration of National Zone numbering information is\n      determined\
    \ by the type of Country Code resource that a National\n      Zone is behind:\n\
    \      *  The national zone, for geographic resources, is a national\n       \
    \  matter and is, therefore, administered by the ITU Member\n         State(s)\
    \ to which the country code is assigned.  In an\n         integrated numbering\
    \ plan, e.g., CC \"1\", each Country within\n         the plan may administer\
    \ their portion of the resource in a\n         different manner.\n      *  For\
    \ national zone resources behind the Country Codes assigned\n         to and shared\
    \ by Networks, the entity to which the resource is\n         assigned provides\
    \ the E.164 assignment information, to DNS\n         administrators for performing\
    \ the administrative function.\n      *  For national zone resources behind the\
    \ Country Codes assigned\n         to and shared by Groups of Countries, the administrative\
    \ entity\n         identified by the Countries of the Group provides the E.164\n\
    \         assignment information, to DNS administrators, for performing\n    \
    \     the administrative function.  Note that the creation of this\n         category\
    \ is dependent upon the approval of draft Recommendation\n         E.164.3.\n\
    \   o  Each of the administrative entities responsible for the\n      administration\
    \ of resources within the zones (as identified above)\n      is individually and\
    \ separately responsible for ensuring that DNS\n      administrators are aware\
    \ of appropriate changes to their resources\n      once they have agreed to their\
    \ input into the DNS.\n   o  Assigned geographic E.164 resources, for all zones,\
    \ not authorized\n      for input by the appropriate administrative entity will\
    \ not be\n      entered into the DNS under any circumstance.  For example, if\
    \ the\n      ENUM service is not approved for use in a country, by the\n     \
    \ appropriate ITU Member States, the E.164 numbers of that country\n      will\
    \ not be input to the DNS.\n   o  With regard to Number Portability, it was agreed\
    \ that WP1/2 would\n      further study this issue, in the context of ENUM.  However,\
    \ it is\n      currently understood that this study and its result will not\n\
    \      impact the IETF and its work.\n   o  The study being undertaken within\
    \ WP1/2 (referred to above) will\n      also attempt to identify options and provide\
    \ guidance to assist\n      those entities charged with the task of providing\
    \ the\n      administrative information to DNS administrators.\n   o  All administrative\
    \ entities, including DNS administrators, will\n      adhere to all the applicable\
    \ tenets of all pertinent ITU\n      Recommendations, e.g., E.164, E.164.1, E.190,\
    \ and E.195, with\n      regard to the inclusion of the E.164 resource information\
    \ in the\n      DNS.\n   o  The ITU, IETF, and IAB will jointly cooperate fully\
    \ to ensure that\n      the agreed administrative procedures to accommodate the\
    \ above\n      understandings, and any other mutually agreed appropriate future\n\
    \      understandings, will be implemented and adhered to on an ongoing\n    \
    \  basis.  The ITU may request the consultation of the WP1/2 experts\n      as\
    \ necessary and as prescribed in Resolution 20.\n"

    \   o  The issues surrounding number portability are to be addressed in\n    \
    \  the draft supplement to Recommendation E.370\n   o  This issue surrounding\
    \ freephone service was expanded to include\n      other global services (i.e.,\
    \ International Premium Rate Service\n      and International Shared Cost Service).\
    \  Preliminary findings\n      would indicate that routing the call to the appropriate\n\
    \      destination will depend on successfully receiving information\n      about\
    \ the geographic point of origination (e.g., calling\n      \"telephone Number\"\
    ).  A proxy server would process such\n      information and either redirect or\
    \ forward the call (based on the\n      proxy owner's decision) on to the appropriate\
    \ destination.\n   o  The issue surrounding selection of the IP gateway within\
    \ a PSTN-\n      to-IP call flow may depend on options that may be available to\n\
    \      telephony carriers in such selection.\n   The WP1/2 collaborators thank\
    \ their IETF counterparts who attended\n   this meeting and assisted in the resolution\
    \ of these issues.\n   Any questions regarding the contents of this liaison should\
    \ be\n   referred to the WP1/2 Chairman Roy Blane at Roy_Blane@inmarsat.com.\n"
- title: 3. Security Considerations (added by the IESG)
  contents:
  - "3. Security Considerations (added by the IESG)\n   The ENUM solution uses the\
    \ Domain Name System (DNS) for storage of\n   information.  Delegation and distributed\
    \ administration is done\n   according to DNS routines.  The E.164 numbers are\
    \ though distributed\n   according to a different algorithm than domain names.\n\
    \   This Liaison Statement describes how mapping E.164 number\n   administration\
    \ and DNS administration can work together, and how\n   further discussions are\
    \ delegated to each administrative body for the\n   country codes in E.164 space.\n\
    \   If delegation and mapping is not done carefully between E.164 and DNS\n  \
    \ there is a risk of \"napping\" of E.164 numbers when they are stored in\n  \
    \ DNS.  It is also important that the DNS strictly hierarchal system is\n   preserved\
    \ (see RFC 2826 [1]).\n"
