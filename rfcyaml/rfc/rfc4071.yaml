  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the structure of the IETF Administrative\n\
    \   Support Activity (IASA) as an activity housed within the Internet\n   Society\
    \ (ISOC).  It defines the roles and responsibilities of the\n   IETF Administrative\
    \ Oversight Committee (IAOC), the IETF\n   Administrative Director (IAD), and\
    \ ISOC in the fiscal and\n   administrative support of the IETF standards process.\
    \  It also\n   defines the membership and selection rules for the IAOC.\n   The\
    \ IETF undertakes its technical activities as an ongoing, open,\n   consensus-based\
    \ process.  This document defines an administrative\n   support structure intended\
    \ to be responsive to the administrative\n   needs of the IETF technical community,\
    \ and it describes how that\n   support structure fits under ISOC's organizational\
    \ umbrella.  This\n   document does not affect the ISOC-IETF working relationship\
    \ as it\n   relates to standards development or the communication of technical\n\
    \   advice relevant to the policy and educational goals of ISOC.\n   The IETF\
    \ Administrative Support Activity (IASA) provides the\n   administrative structure\
    \ required to support the IETF standards\n   process and to support the IETF's\
    \ technical activities.  As of the\n   time at which this document was written,\
    \ this included the work of\n   IETF working groups, the IESG, the IAB, and the\
    \ IRTF.  Should the\n   IETF standards process at some future date come to include\
    \ other\n   technical activities, the IAOC is responsible for developing plans\
    \ to\n   provide administrative support for them.  Such support includes, as\n\
    \   appropriate, undertaking or contracting for the work described in\n   [RFC3716],\
    \ including IETF document and data management, IETF\n   meetings, and any operational\
    \ agreements or contracts with the RFC\n   Editor and the Internet Assigned Numbers\
    \ Authority (IANA).  The IASA\n   is also ultimately responsible for the financial\
    \ activities\n   associated with IETF administrative support, such as collecting\
    \ IETF\n   meeting fees, paying invoices, managing budgets and financial\n   accounts,\
    \ and so forth.\n   The IASA is responsible for ensuring that the IETF's administrative\n\
    \   needs are met, and met well.  The IETF does not expect the IASA to\n   undertake\
    \ the bulk of this work directly; rather, the IETF expects\n   the IASA to contract\
    \ this work from others and to manage these\n   contractual relationships to achieve\
    \ efficiency, transparency, and\n   cost effectiveness.\n   The IASA is distinct\
    \ from IETF-related technical functions, such as\n   the RFC Editor, the IANA,\
    \ and the IETF standards process itself.  The\n   IASA has no influence on the\
    \ technical decisions of the IETF or on\n   the technical contents of IETF work.\
    \  Note, however, that this in no\n   way prevents people who form part of the\
    \ IASA from participating as\n   individuals in IETF technical activities.\n"

- title: 2.2.  Principles of the IASA, IETF, and ISOC Relationship
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Principles of the IASA, IETF, and ISOC Relationship\n   This section attempts\
    \ to describe principles underlying the\n   mechanisms described in this document.\n\
    \   1.  The IETF intends to establish a structure (the IASA) in order to\n   \
    \    have IETF administrative functions managed appropriately,\n       according\
    \ to good administrative, fiscal, and management\n       principles.  The IASA\
    \ includes the IAD and the IAOC and shall be\n       housed within ISOC.\n   2.\
    \  The IAD and IAOC shall not have any authority over the IETF\n       standards\
    \ development activities.  This document does not modify\n       ISOC's other\
    \ roles related to the IETF standards process.\n   3.  The IAD and IAOC, in cooperation\
    \ with the ISOC President/CEO and\n       staff, shall develop an annual budget\
    \ for the IASA.  The budget\n       must clearly identify all expected direct\
    \ and indirect\n       expenditures related to the IASA.  ISOC, through its normal\n\
    \       procedures, shall evaluate and approve the IASA budget as part of\n  \
    \     ISOC's own budget process and commit to ensuring funds to support\n    \
    \   the approved budget.\n   4.  Responsibility for the evaluation, review, and\
    \ negotiation of\n       contracts and other IETF administrative and support agreements\n\
    \       and other expenditures of funds under the IASA shall rest with\n     \
    \  the IAD, operating in accordance with policies and procedures set\n       by\
    \ the IAOC and consistent with ISOC operating policies.\n   5.  Once funds or\
    \ in-kind donations have been credited to the IASA\n       accounts, they shall\
    \ be irrevocably allocated to the support of\n       the IETF.\n   6.  There shall\
    \ be a detailed public accounting to separately\n       identify all funds available\
    \ to and all expenditures relating to\n       the IETF and to the IASA, including\
    \ any donations, of funds or in\n       kind, received by ISOC for IETF-related\
    \ activities.  In-kind\n       donations shall only be accepted at the direction\
    \ of the IAD and\n       IAOC.\n   7.  Amongst the IETF, IASA and ISOC, the IETF,\
    \ through the IASA,\n       shall have a perpetual right to use, display, distribute,\n\
    \       reproduce, modify, and create derivatives of all software and\n      \
    \ data created in support of IETF activities.\n   8.  The IASA, in cooperation\
    \ with ISOC, shall use reasonable efforts\n       to ensure that sufficient reserves\
    \ exist to keep the IETF\n       operational in the case of unexpected events\
    \ such as income\n       shortfalls.\n   The remainder of this document contains\
    \ details based on the above\n   principles.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Community Consensus and Grant of Authority
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Community Consensus and Grant of Authority\n   The IETF is a consensus-based\
    \ group, and authority to act on behalf\n   of the community requires a high degree\
    \ of consensus and the\n   continued consent of the community.  After a careful\
    \ process of\n   deliberation, a broad-based community consensus emerged to house\
    \ the\n   IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) within the Internet\n  \
    \ Society.  This document reflects that consensus.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.  Termination and Change\n   Any change to this agreement shall require a\
    \ similar level of\n   community consensus and deliberation and shall be reflected\
    \ by a\n   subsequent Best Current Practice (BCP) document.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Effective Date for Commencement of IASA
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Effective Date for Commencement of IASA\n   The procedures in this document\
    \ shall become operational after this\n   document has been approved by the process\
    \ defined in BCP 9 [RFC2026],\n   including its acceptance as an IETF process\
    \ BCP by the ISOC Board of\n   Trustees, and after the ISOC Board of Trustees\
    \ has confirmed its\n   acceptance of ISOC's responsibilities under the terms\
    \ herein\n   described.\n"
- title: 3.  Structure of the IASA
  contents:
  - "3.  Structure of the IASA\n   The IASA structure is designed to ensure accountability\
    \ and\n   transparency of the IETF administrative and fiscal activities to the\n\
    \   IETF community.  The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)\n   directs\
    \ and oversees the IASA.  The IAOC consists of volunteers, all\n   chosen directly\
    \ or indirectly by the IETF community, as well as\n   appropriate ex officio members\
    \ from ISOC and IETF leadership.  The\n   IAOC shall be accountable to the IETF\
    \ community for the\n   effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency of the IASA.\n\
    \   The IASA consists initially of a single full-time ISOC employee, the\n   IETF\
    \ Administrative Director (IAD), who is entitled to act on behalf\n   of the IASA\
    \ at the direction of the IAOC.  The IAD is likely to draw\n   on financial, legal,\
    \ and administrative support furnished by ISOC\n   support staff or consultants.\
    \  Costs for ISOC support staff and\n   consultants are allocated based on actual\
    \ expenses or on some other\n   allocation model determined by consultation between\
    \ the IAOC and\n   ISOC.\n   Although the IAD is an ISOC employee, he or she works\
    \ under the\n   direction of the IAOC.  A committee of the IAOC is responsible\
    \ for\n   hiring and firing the IAD, for reviewing the IAD's performance, and\n\
    \   for setting the compensation of the IAD.  The members of this\n   committee\
    \ are appointed by the IAOC and consist at minimum of the\n   ISOC President,\
    \ the IETF Chair, and one of the Nomcom-appointed IAOC\n   members.\n   The IAOC\
    \ determines what IETF administrative functions are to be\n   performed, and how\
    \ or where they should be performed (whether\n   internally within the IASA or\
    \ by outside organizations), so as to\n   maintain an optimal balance of functional\
    \ performance and cost of\n   each such function.  The IAOC should document all\
    \ such decisions, and\n   the justification for them, for review by the community.\
    \  Each\n   function should be reviewed on a regular basis using the assumption\n\
    \   that, absent such justification, the function is either unnecessary\n   or,\
    \ if necessary, it is overstaffed, rather than using an assumption\n   that anything\
    \ that has been done in the past is still necessary; each\n   function should\
    \ be adjusted as needed given the result of this\n   review.\n   The IAD is responsible\
    \ for negotiating and maintaining contracts or\n   equivalent instruments with\
    \ outside organizations, and for providing\n   any coordination necessary to make\
    \ sure that the IETF administrative\n   support functions are covered properly.\
    \  All functions, whether\n   contracted to outside organizations or performed\
    \ internally within\n   the IASA, must be clearly specified and documented with\
    \ well-defined\n   deliverables, service level agreements, and transparent accounting\n\
    \   for the cost of such functions.\n   The IASA is responsible for managing all\
    \ intellectual property rights\n   (IPR), including but not limited to trademarks,\
    \ and copyrights that\n   belong to the IETF.  The IASA is also responsible for\
    \ managing the\n   ownership, registration, and administration of relevant domain\
    \ names.\n   The IASA is responsible for undertaking any and all required actions\n\
    \   on behalf of the IETF to obtain, protect, and manage the rights that\n   the\
    \ IETF needs to carry out its work.\n   If the IASA cannot comply with the procedures\
    \ described in this\n   document for legal, accounting, or practical reasons,\
    \ the IAOC shall\n   report that fact to the community, along with the variant\
    \ procedure\n   that the IAOC intends to follow.  If the problem is a long-term\
    \ one,\n   the IAOC shall ask the IETF to update this document to reflect the\n\
    \   changed procedure.\n"
- title: 3.1.  IAD Responsibilities
  contents:
  - "3.1.  IAD Responsibilities\n   The IAD is responsible for working with the IAOC\
    \ and others to\n   understand the administrative requirements of the IETF, and\
    \ for\n   managing the IASA to meet those needs.  This includes determining the\n\
    \   structure of the IASA effort, establishing an operating budget,\n   negotiating\
    \ contracts with service providers, managing the business\n   relationship with\
    \ those providers, and establishing mechanisms to\n   track their performance.\
    \  The IAD may also manage other contractors\n   or ISOC employees (such as support\
    \ staff) as necessary, when such\n   contractors or employees are engaged in IASA-related\
    \ work.\n   The IAD is responsible for running the IASA in an open and\n   transparent\
    \ manner, and for producing regular monthly, quarterly, and\n   annual financial\
    \ and operational updates for IAOC and IETF community\n   review.\n   The IAD\
    \ is responsible for administering the IETF finances, for\n   managing separate\
    \ financial accounts for the IASA, and for\n   establishing and administering\
    \ the IASA budget.  The IAD (with IAOC\n   approval, as appropriate) should have\
    \ signing authority consistent\n   with carrying out IASA work effectively, efficiently\
    \ and\n   independently, taking into account ISOC's financial and approval\n \
    \  controls.  If there are any problems regarding the level of financial\n   approval\
    \ granted to the IAD, the IAOC and ISOC shall work out a\n   policy that is mutually\
    \ agreeable, and they shall do so within a\n   reasonable time frame.\n   The\
    \ IAD negotiates service contracts, with input, as appropriate,\n   from other\
    \ bodies, including legal advice, and with review, as\n   appropriate, by the\
    \ IAOC.  The IAOC should establish guidelines for\n   what level of review is\
    \ expected based on contract type, size, cost,\n   or duration.  ISOC executes\
    \ contracts on behalf of the IASA, after\n   whatever review ISOC requires to\
    \ ensure that the contracts meet\n   ISOC's legal and financial guidelines.\n\
    \   The IAD shall ensure that contracts entered into by ISOC on behalf of\n  \
    \ the IASA and/or the IETF (an \"IASA Contract\") that provide for the\n   creation,\
    \ development, modification, or storage of any data\n   (including, without limitation,\
    \ any data relating to IETF membership,\n   documents, archives, mailing lists,\
    \ correspondence, financial\n   records, personnel records and the like) (\"Data\"\
    ), grant to ISOC the\n   perpetual, irrevocable right, on behalf of IASA and IETF,\
    \ to use,\n   display, distribute, reproduce, modify and create derivatives of\
    \ such\n   Data.  ISOC will permit IASA and its designee(s) to have sole control\n\
    \   and custodianship of such Data, and ISOC will not utilize or access\n   such\
    \ Data in connection with any ISOC function other than IETF\n   without the written\
    \ consent of the IAD.\n   The IAD shall ensure that personal data collected for\
    \ legitimate\n   purposes of the IASA are protected appropriately; at minimum,\
    \ such\n   data must be protected to a degree consistent with relevant\n   legislation\
    \ and applicable privacy policies.\n   If an IASA Contract provides for the creation,\
    \ development, or\n   modification of any software (including, without limitation,\
    \ any\n   search tools, indexing tools, and the like) (\"Developed Software\"\
    ),\n   then the IAD shall, whenever reasonable and practical, ensure that\n  \
    \ such contract either (a) grants ownership of such Developed Software\n   to\
    \ ISOC, or (b) grants ISOC a perpetual, irrevocable right, on behalf\n   of IASA\
    \ and IETF, to use, display, distribute, reproduce, modify, and\n   create derivatives\
    \ of such Software (including, without limitation,\n   pursuant to an open source\
    \ style license).  It is preferred that\n   Developed Software be provided and\
    \ licensed for IASA and IETF use in\n   source code form, with no ongoing payments.\
    \  ISOC will permit the\n   IASA and its designee(s) to have sole control and\
    \ custodianship of\n   such Developed Software.  The foregoing rights are not\
    \ required in\n   the case of off-the-shelf or other commercially-available software\n\
    \   that is not developed at the expense of ISOC.\n   If an IASA Contract relates\
    \ to the licensing of third-party software,\n   the IAD shall ensure that such\
    \ license expressly permits use of such\n   software for and on behalf of the\
    \ IASA and/or the IETF, as\n   applicable, and that such license is transferable\
    \ in accordance with\n   the provisions of Section 7 (Removability).\n   Notwithstanding\
    \ the foregoing, the IAD can enter into different terms\n   if doing so is in\
    \ the best interest of the IETF and upon approval of\n   the IAOC.\n   The IAD\
    \ and IAOC are responsible for making all business decisions\n   regarding the\
    \ IASA.  In particular, the ISOC Board of Trustees shall\n   not have direct influence\
    \ over the choice of IASA contractors or IETF\n   meeting sponsors.  This restriction\
    \ is meant to enforce the\n   separation between fund-raising and the actual operation\
    \ of the\n   standards process.\n   The IAD prepares an annual budget, which is\
    \ subject to review and\n   approval by the IAOC.  The IAD is responsible for\
    \ presenting this\n   budget to the ISOC Board of Trustees, as part of ISOC's\
    \ annual\n   financial planning process.  As described elsewhere in this document,\n\
    \   the IAOC is responsible for ensuring the budget's suitability for\n   meeting\
    \ the IETF community's administrative needs, but the IAOC does\n   not bear fiduciary\
    \ responsibility for ISOC.  The ISOC Board of\n   Trustees therefore needs to\
    \ review and understand the budget and\n   planned activity in enough detail to\
    \ carry out its fiduciary\n   responsibility properly.  The IAD is responsible\
    \ for managing this\n   process of review and approval.  The IAD sees to it that\
    \ the IASA\n   publishes its complete approved budget to the IETF community each\n\
    \   year.\n"
- title: 3.2.  IAOC Responsibilities
  contents:
  - "3.2.  IAOC Responsibilities\n   The IAOC's role is to provide appropriate direction\
    \ to the IAD, to\n   review the IAD's regular reports, and to oversee IASA functions\
    \ to\n   ensure that the administrative needs of the IETF community are being\n\
    \   properly met.  The IAOC's mission is not to be engaged in the day-\n   to-day\
    \ administrative work of the IASA, but rather to provide\n   appropriate direction,\
    \ oversight, and approval.\n   Therefore, the IAOC's responsibilities are as follows:\n\
    \   o  To select the IAD and to provide high-level review and direction\n    \
    \  for his or her work.  This task should be handled by a sub-\n      committee,\
    \ as described above.\n   o  To review the IAD's plans and contracts to ensure\
    \ that they will\n      meet the administrative needs of the IETF.\n   o  To track\
    \ whether the IASA functions are meeting the IETF\n      community's administrative\
    \ needs, and to work with the IAD to\n      determine a plan for corrective action\
    \ if they are not.\n   o  To review the IAD's budget proposals to ensure that\
    \ they will meet\n      the IETF's needs, and to review the IAD's regular financial\n\
    \      reports.\n   o  To ensure that the IASA is run in a transparent and accountable\n\
    \      manner.  Although the day-to-day work should be delegated to the\n    \

- title: 3.5.  Review and Appeal of IAD and IAOC Decision
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Review and Appeal of IAD and IAOC Decision\n   The IAOC is directly accountable\
    \ to the IETF community for the\n   performance of the IASA.  In order to achieve\
    \ this, the IAOC and IAD\n   will ensure that guidelines are developed for regular\
    \ operational\n   decision making.  Where appropriate, these guidelines should\
    \ be\n   developed with public input.  In all cases, they must be made public.\n\
    \   If a member of the IETF community questions whether a decision or\n   action\
    \ of the IAD or the IAOC has been undertaken in accordance with\n   IETF BCPs\
    \ or IASA operational guidelines, or questions whether the\n   IASA has created\
    \ and maintained appropriate guidelines, he or she may\n   ask the IAOC for a\
    \ formal review of the decision or action.\n   The request for review should be\
    \ addressed to the IAOC chair and\n   should include a description of the decision\
    \ or action to be\n   reviewed, an explanation of how, in the requestor's opinion,\
    \ the\n   decision or action violates the BCPs or operational guidelines, and\
    \ a\n   suggestion for how the situation could be rectified.  All requests\n \
    \  for review shall be posted publicly, and the IAOC is expected to\n   respond\
    \ to these requests within a reasonable period, typically\n   within 90 days.\
    \  It is up to the IAOC to determine what type of\n   review and response is required,\
    \ based on the nature of the review\n   request.  Based on the results of the\
    \ review, the IAOC may choose to\n   overturn their own decision, to change their\
    \ operational guidelines\n   to prevent further misunderstandings, to take other\
    \ action as\n   appropriate, or just to publish the review result and take no\
    \ other\n   action.\n   If a member of the community is not satisfied with the\
    \ IAOC's\n   response to his or her review request, he or she may escalate the\n\
    \   issue by appealing the decision or action to the IAB, using the\n   appeals\
    \ procedures outlined in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].  If he or she is\n   not satisfied\
    \ with the IAB response, he or she can escalate the issue\n   to the ISOC Board\
    \ of Trustees, as described in RFC 2026.\n   The reviewing body (the IAB or ISOC\
    \ Board of Trustees) shall review\n   the decision of the IAD or IAOC to determine\
    \ whether it was made in\n   accordance with existing BCPs and operational guidelines.\
    \  As a\n   result of this review, the reviewing body may recommend to the\n \
    \  community that the BCPs governing IAOC actions should be changed.\n   The reviewing\
    \ body may also advise the IAOC to modify existing\n   operational guidelines\
    \ to avoid similar issues in the future and/or\n   it may advise the IAOC to re-consider\
    \ their decision or action.  It\n   may also recommend that no action be taken,\
    \ based on the review.\n   In exceptional cases, when no other recourse seems\
    \ reasonable, the\n   reviewing body may overturn or reverse a non-binding decision\
    \ or\n   action of the IAOC.  This should be done only after careful\n   consideration\
    \ and consultation with the IAOC regarding the\n   ramifications of this action.\
    \  In no circumstances may the IAB or\n   ISOC Board of Trustees overturn a decision\
    \ of the IAOC that involves\n   a binding contract or overturn a personnel-related\
    \ action (such as\n   hiring, firing, promotion, demotion, performance reviews,\
    \ salary\n   adjustments, etc.).\n"
- title: 4.  IAOC Membership, Selection and Accountability
  contents:
  - "4.  IAOC Membership, Selection and Accountability\n   The IAOC shall consist\
    \ of eight voting members who shall be selected\n   as follows:\n   o  Two members\
    \ appointed by the IETF Nominations Committee (NomCom);\n   o  One member appointed\
    \ by the IESG;\n   o  One member appointed by the IAB;\n   o  One member appointed\
    \ by the ISOC Board of Trustees;\n   o  The IETF Chair (ex officio);\n   o  The\
    \ IAB Chair (ex officio);\n   o  The ISOC President/CEO (ex officio).\n   The\
    \ IETF Administrative Director also serves, ex officio, as a non-\n   voting member\
    \ of the IAOC.\n   The IAOC may also choose to invite liaisons from other groups,\
    \ but it\n   is not required to do so; the IAOC decides whether to have a liaison\n\
    \   to any particular group.  Any such liaisons are non-voting.\n   Responsibility\
    \ for selecting the individual filling a particular\n   liaison role lies with\
    \ the body from which the IAOC has requested the\n   liaison.\n   Subject to paragraph\
    \ 2 of Section 4.1, appointed members of the IAOC\n   serve two-year terms.  IAOC\
    \ terms normally end at the end of the\n   first IETF meeting of a year.\n   The\
    \ members of the IAOC shall select one of its appointed voting\n   members to\
    \ serve as the chair of the IAOC.  The term of the IAOC\n   chair shall be one\
    \ year from the time of selection or the remaining\n   time of his or her tenure\
    \ on the IAOC, whichever is less.  An\n   individual may serve any number of terms\
    \ as chair, if selected by the\n   IAOC.\n   The Chair serves at the pleasure\
    \ of the IAOC and may be removed from\n   that position at any time by a vote\
    \ of 2/3 of the voting IAOC\n   members, not counting the IAOC chair.\n   The\
    \ chair of the IAOC shall have the authority to manage the\n   activities and\
    \ meetings of the IAOC.\n   The two NomCom-appointed IAOC members are chosen using\
    \ the procedures\n   described in RFC 3777 [RFC3777].  For the initial IAOC selection,\
    \ the\n   IESG will provide the list of desired qualifications for these\n   positions;\
    \ in later years, the IAOC will provide this qualification\n   list.  The IESG\
    \ will serve as the confirming body for IAOC\n   appointments by the NomCom.\n\
    \   While there are no hard rules regarding how the IAB and the IESG\n   should\
    \ select members of the IAOC, such appointees need not be\n   current IAB or IESG\
    \ members (and probably should not be, if only to\n   avoid overloading the existing\
    \ leadership).  The IAB and IESG should\n   choose people with some knowledge\
    \ of contracts and financial\n   procedures, who are familiar with the administrative\
    \ support needs of\n   the IAB, the IESG, or the IETF standards process.  The\
    \ IAB and IESG\n   should follow a fairly open process for these selections, perhaps\n\
    \   with an open call for nominations or a period of public comment on\n   the\
    \ candidates.  The procedure for IAB selection of ISOC Board of\n   Trustees [RFC3677]\
    \ might be a good model for how this could work.\n   After the IETF gains some\
    \ experience with IAOC selection, these\n   selection mechanisms should be documented\
    \ more formally.\n   Although the IAB, the IESG, and the ISOC Board of Trustees\
    \ choose\n   some members of the IAOC, those members do not directly represent\
    \ the\n   bodies that chose them.  All members of the IAOC are accountable\n \
    \  directly to the IETF community.  To receive direct feedback from the\n   community,\
    \ the IAOC holds an open meeting at least once per year at\n   an IETF meeting.\
    \  This may take the form of an open IAOC plenary or a\n   working meeting held\
    \ during an IETF meeting slot.  The form and\n   contents of this meeting are\
    \ left to the discretion of the IAOC\n   Chair.  The IAOC should also consider\
    \ open mailing lists or other\n   means to establish open communication with the\
    \ community.\n   IAOC members are subject to recall in the event that an IAOC\
    \ member\n   abrogates his or her duties or acts against the best interests of\
    \ the\n   IETF community.  Any appointed IAOC member, including any appointed\n\
    \   by the IAB, IESG, or ISOC Board of Trustees, may be recalled using\n   the\
    \ recall procedure defined in RFC 3777 [RFC3777].  IAOC members are\n   not, however,\
    \ subject to recall by the bodies that appointed them.\n   If a vacancy occurs\
    \ among the appointed members, this is filled by\n   the appointing body for that\
    \ position according to its procedures.\n   The IAOC members shall not receive\
    \ any compensation from the IASA,\n   ISOC, or IETF for their services as members\
    \ of the IAOC.\n   The IAOC shall set and publish rules covering reimbursement\
    \ of\n   expenses, and such reimbursement shall generally be for exceptional\n\
    \   cases only.\n"

    \ their\n   selections as quickly as possible while complying with the documented\n\
    \   NomCom procedures.  The IAOC will become active as soon as a majority\n  \
    \ (three or more) of the appointed members have been selected.\n   Initially,\
    \ the IESG and the ISOC Board of Trustees will make one-year\n   appointments,\
    \ the IAB will make a two-year appointment, and the\n   NomCom will make one one-year\

  - "5.3.  Designated Donations, Monetary and In-Kind\n   Donations are an essential\
    \ component of funding.  The IASA undertakes\n   no direct fund-raising activities.\
    \  This establishes a practice of\n   separating IETF administrative and standards\
    \ activities from fund-\n   raising activities, and it helps ensure that no undue\
    \ influence may\n   be ascribed to those from whom funds are raised.\n   ISOC\
    \ shall create and maintain appropriate structures and programs to\n   coordinate\
    \ donations intended to support the work of the IETF, and\n   these shall include\
    \ mechanisms for both in-kind and direct\n   contributions to the work supported\
    \ by IASA.  Since ISOC will be the\n   sole entity through whom donations may\
    \ be made to the work of the\n   IETF, ISOC shall ensure that those programs are\
    \ not unduly\n   restrictive.  ISOC shall maintain programs that allow for designated\n\
    \   donations to the IETF.\n   In-kind resources are owned by the ISOC on behalf\
    \ of the IETF and\n   shall be reported and accounted for in a manner that identifies\

- title: 5.6.  Operating Reserve
  contents:
  - "5.6.  Operating Reserve\n   As an initial guideline and in normal operating circumstances,\
    \ the\n   IASA should have an operating reserve for its activities sufficient\n\
    \   to cover 6 months of non-meeting operational expenses, plus twice the\n  \
    \ recent average for meeting contract guarantees.  The IASA, in\n   cooperation\
    \ with ISOC, shall establish detailed targets for a reserve\n   fund to cover\
    \ normal operating expenses and meeting expenses, in\n   accordance with prudent\
    \ planning and as part of the budget process.\n   The IASA expects ISOC to use\
    \ reasonable efforts to build and provide\n   that operational reserve, through\

  contents:
  - "6.  IASA Budget Process\n   While the IASA sets a budget for the IETF's administrative\
    \ needs, its\n   budget process clearly needs to be closely coordinated with ISOC's.\n\
    \   The specific timeline shall be established each year by IASA and\n   ISOC.\
    \  As an example, a general annual timeline for budgeting is:\n   July 1: The\
    \ IAD presents a budget proposal (prepared in consultation\n      with ISOC staff)\
    \ for the following fiscal year, with 3-year\n      projections, to the IAOC.\n\
    \   August 1: The IAOC approves the budget proposal for IETF purposes,\n     \
    \ after any appropriate revisions.  As the ISOC President is part of\n      the\
    \ IAOC, the IAOC should have a preliminary indication of how the\n      budget\
    \ will fit with ISOC's own budgetary expectations.  The\n      budget proposal\
    \ is passed to the ISOC Board of Trustees for review\n      in accordance with\
    \ its fiduciary duty.\n   September 1: The ISOC Board of Trustees approves the\
    \ budget proposal\n      provisionally.  During the next 2 months, the budget\
    \ may be\n      revised to be integrated in ISOC's overall budgeting process.\n\
    \   November 1: Final budget to the ISOC Board for approval.\n   The dates described\
    \ above are examples and are subject to change.\n   They will most likely be modified\
    \ each year based on the dates of the\n   second and third IETF meetings of that\
    \ year.  They also need to be\n   synchronized with the ISOC budgeting process.\n\
    \   The IAD shall provide monthly accountings of expenses and shall\n   update\
    \ expenditures forecasts every quarter.  This may require\n   adjustment of the\
    \ IASA budget.  If so, the revised budget will need\n   to be approved by the\
    \ IAOC, the ISOC President/CEO and, if necessary,\n   the ISOC Board of Trustees.\n"

    \ that are\n      related to, but not part of, the IASA standards support activity.\n\
    \      In particular, a detailed budget for the entire related ISOC\n      activity,\
    \ quarterly financial reports, and audited annual\n      financial reports shall\
    \ all be available to the IETF community.\n      In addition, key contract material\
    \ and MOUs shall also be publicly\n      available, subject to any reasonable\

    \ part of this arrangement, ISOC's sponsorship of the\n      RFC Editor, IAB and\
    \ IESG shall be managed as part of the IASA\n      under the IAOC.\n   Independence:\

    \ called a\n      BCP).  In such a case, the IAOC shall give ISOC a minimum of\
    \ six\n      months' notice before the transition formally occurs.  During that\n\
    \      period, the IETF and ISOC shall work together to create a smooth\n    \
    \  transition that does not result in any significant service outages\n      or\
    \ missed IETF meetings.  All contracts executed by ISOC on behalf\n      of the\
    \ IASA shall either include a clause allowing termination by\n      ISOC with\
    \ six months notice, or be transferable to another\n      corporation in the event\
