  - "Abstract\n   This document explains why, after more than six years as proposed\n\
    \   standards, the DNS Server and Resolver MIB extensions were never\n   deployed,\
    \ and recommends retiring these MIB extensions by moving them\n   to Historical\
    \ status.\n"
- title: 1. History
  contents:
  - "1. History\n   The road to the DNS MIB extensions was paved with good intentions.\n\
    \   In retrospect, it's obvious that the working group never had much\n   agreement\
    \ on what belonged in the MIB extensions, just that we should\n   have some. \
    \ This happened during the height of the craze for MIB\n   extensions in virtually\
    \ every protocol that the IETF was working on\n   at the time, so the question\
    \ of why we were doing this in the first\n   place never got a lot of scrutiny.\
    \  Very late in the development\n   cycle we discovered that much of the support\
    \ for writing the MIB\n   extensions in the first place had come from people who\
    \ wanted to use\n   SNMP SET operations to update DNS zones on the fly.  Examination\
    \ of\n   the security model involved, however, led us to conclude that this\n\
    \   was not a good way to do dynamic update and that a separate DNS\n   Dynamic\
    \ Update protocol would be necessary.\n   The MIB extensions started out being\
    \ fairly specific to one\n   particular DNS implementation (BIND-4.8.3); as work\
    \ progressed, the\n   BIND-specific portions were rewritten to be as implementation-neutral\n\
    \   as we knew how to make them, but somehow every revision of the MIB\n   extensions\
    \ managed to create new counters that just happened to\n   closely match statistics\
    \ kept by some version of BIND.  As a result,\n   the MIB extensions ended up\
    \ being much too big, which raised a number\n   of concerns with the network management\
    \ directorate, but the WG\n   resisted every attempt to remove any of these variables.\
    \  In the end,\n   large portions of the MIB extensions were moved into optional\
    \ groups\n   in an attempt to get the required subset down to a manageable size.\n\
    \   The DNS Server and Resolver MIB extensions were one of the first\n   attempts\
    \ to write MIB extensions for a protocol usually considered to\n   be at the application\
    \ layer.  Fairly early on it became clear that,\n   while it was certainly possible\
    \ to write MIB extensions for DNS, the\n   SMI was not really designed with this\
    \ sort of thing in mind.  A case\n   in point was the attempt to provide direct\
    \ indexing into the caches\n   in the resolver MIB extensions: while arguably\
    \ the only sane way to\n   do this for a large cache, this required much more\
    \ complex indexing\n   clauses than is usual, and ended up running into known\
    \ length limits\n   for object identifiers in some SNMP implementations.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ the lack of either real proxy MIB support in SNMP\n   managers or a standard\
    \ subagent protocol meant that there was no\n   reasonable way to implement the\
    \ MIB extensions in the dominant\n   implementation (BIND).  When the AgentX subagent\
    \ protocol was\n   developed a few years later, we initially hoped that this would\n\
    \   finally clear the way for an implementation of the DNS MIB\n   extensions,\
    \ but by the time AgentX was a viable protocol it had\n   become clear that nobody\
    \ really wanted to implement these MIB\n   extensions.\n   Finally, the MIB extensions\
    \ took much too long to produce.  In\n   retrospect, this should have been a clear\
    \ warning sign, particularly\n   when the WG had clearly become so tired of the\
    \ project that the\n   authors found it impossible to elicit any comments whatsoever\
    \ on the\n   documents.\n"
- title: 2. Lessons
  contents:
  - "2. Lessons\n   Observations based on the preceding list of mistakes, for the\
    \ benefit\n   of anyone else who ever attempts to write DNS MIB extensions again:\n\
    \   -  Define a clear set of goals before writing any MIB extensions.\n      Know\
    \ who the constituency is and make sure that what you write\n      solves their\
    \ problem.\n   -  Keep the MIB extensions short, and don't add variables just\n\
    \      because somebody in the WG thinks they'd be a cool thing to\n      measure.\n\
    \   -  If some portion of the task seems to be very hard to do within the\n  \
    \    SMI, that's a strong hint that SNMP is not the right tool for\n      whatever\
    \ it is that you're trying to do.\n   -  If the entire project is taking too long,\
    \ perhaps that's a hint\n      too.\n"
- title: 3. Recommendation
  contents:
  - "3. Recommendation\n   In view of the community's apparent total lack of interest\
    \ in\n   deploying these MIB extensions, we recommend that RFCs 1611 and 1612\n\
    \   be reclassified as Historical documents.\n"

  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   Re-classifying an existing MIB document from Proposed\
    \ Standard to\n   Historic should not have any negative impact on security for\
    \ the\n   Internet.\n"
