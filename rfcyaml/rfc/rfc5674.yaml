  - "1.  Introduction\n   In addition to sending out alarm information asynchronously
    via\n   protocols such as the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) or\n   the
    Network Configuration Protocol (Netconf), many implementations\n   also log alarms
    via syslog.  This memo defines a set of SD-PARAMs to\n   support logging and defines
    a mapping of syslog severity to the\n   severity of the alarm.\n   The Alarm MIB
    [RFC3877] includes mandatory alarm fields from X.733\n   [X.733] as well as information
    from X.736 [X.736].  In additional,\n   the Alarm MIB introduces its own alarm
    fields.  This memo reuses\n   terminology and fields from the Alarm MIB.\n   The
    key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document
    are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n   Alarm-related terminology
    is defined in [RFC3877].\n   SD-ID, SD-PARAM, and other syslog-related terms are
    defined in\n   [RFC5424].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Severity Mapping\n   The Alarm MIB [RFC3877] defines ITU perceived severities;
    it is\n   useful to be able to relate these to the syslog message fields,\n   particularly
    in the case where alarms are being logged.  This memo\n   describes the representation
    of ITU perceived severities in\n   appropriate syslog fields, which are described
    in [RFC5424].  Syslog\n   offers both a so-called SEVERITY as well as STRUCTURED-DATA.
    \ Due to\n   constraints in syslog, there is no one-to-one mapping possible for\n
    \  SEVERITY.  A STRUCTURED-DATA element is defined in this document to\n   allow
    inclusion of the unmodified ITU perceived severity.\n   Syslog supports Severity
    values different from ITU perceived\n   severities.  These are defined in Section
    6.2.1 of [RFC5424].  The\n   mapping shown in Table 1 below SHOULD be used to
    map ITU perceived\n   severities to syslog severities.\n           ITU Perceived
    Severity      syslog SEVERITY (Name)\n           Critical                    1
    (Alert)\n           Major                       2 (Critical)\n           Minor
    \                      3 (Error)\n           Warning                     4 (Warning)\n
    \          Indeterminate               5 (Notice)\n           Cleared                     5

  - "3.  Alarm STRUCTURED-DATA Elements\n   STRUCTURED-DATA allows the inclusion of
    any structured information\n   into a syslog message.  The following are defined
    in this document to\n   support the structuring of alarm information.\n   o  Resource
    Under Alarm\n   o  Probable Cause\n   o  Event Type\n   o  Perceived Severity\n
    \  o  Trend Indication\n   o  Resource URI\n   Support of the \"alarm\" SD-ID
    is optional but, once supported, some of\n   the SD-PARAMS are mandatory.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  resource\n   If the \"alarm\" SD-ID is included, the \"resource\" SD-PARAM
      MUST be\n   included.  This item uniquely identifies the resource under alarm\n
      \  within the scope of a network element.\n"
    title: 3.1.  resource
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  probableCause\n   If the \"alarm\" SD-ID is included, the \"probableCause\"
      SD-PARAM MUST\n   be included.  This parameter is the mnemonic associated with
      the\n   IANAItuProbableCause object defined within [RFC3877] and any\n   subsequent
      extensions defined by IANA.  For example,\n   IANAItuProbableCause defines a
      transmission failure to a probable\n   cause of 'transmissionError (10)'.  The
      value of the parameter in\n   this case would be 'transmissionError'.\n"
    title: 3.2.  probableCause
  - contents:
    - "3.3.  perceivedSeverity\n   If the \"alarm\" SD-ID is included, the \"perceivedSeverity\"
      SD-PARAM\n   MUST be included.  Similar to the definition of perceived severity
      in\n   [X.736] and [RFC3877], this object can take the following values:\n   o
      \ cleared\n   o  indeterminate\n   o  critical\n   o  major\n   o  minor\n   o
      \ warning\n   See Section 2 for the relationship between this severity and syslog\n
      \  severity.\n"
    title: 3.3.  perceivedSeverity
  - contents:
    - "3.4.  eventType\n   If the \"alarm\" SD-ID is included, the \"eventType\" SD-PARAM
      SHOULD be\n   included.  This parameter is the mnemonic associated with the\n
      \  IANAItuEventType object defined within [RFC3877] and any subsequent\n   extensions
      defined by IANA.  For example, IANAItuEventType defines an\n   environmental
      alarm to an event type of 'environmentalAlarm (6)'.\n   The value of the parameter
      in this case would be\n   'environmentalAlarm'.\n"
    title: 3.4.  eventType
  - contents:
    - "3.5.  trendIndication\n   If the \"alarm\" SD-ID is included, the \"trendIndication\"
      SD-PARAM\n   SHOULD be included.  Similar to the definition of perceived severity\n
      \  in [X.733] and [RFC3877], this object can take the following values:\n   o
      \ moreSevere\n   o  noChange\n   o  lessSevere\n"
    title: 3.5.  trendIndication
  - contents:
    - "3.6.  resourceURI\n   If the \"alarm\" SD-ID is included, the \"resourceURI\"
      SD-PARAM SHOULD\n   be included.  This item uniquely identifies the resource
      under alarm.\n   The value of this field MUST conform to the URI definition
      in\n   [RFC3986] and its updates.  In the case of an SNMP resource, the\n   syntax
      in [RFC4088] MUST be used and \"resourceURI\" must point to the\n   same resource
      as alarmActiveResourceId [RFC3877] for this alarm.\n   Both the \"resource\"
      and the \"resourceURI\" parameters point at the\n   resource experiencing the
      alarm, but the \"resourceURI\" has syntactic\n   constraint requiring it to
      be a URI.  This makes it easy to correlate\n   this syslog alarm with any alarms
      that are received via other\n   protocols, such as SNMP, or to use SNMP or other
      protocols to get\n   additional information about this resource.\n"

    this example, extended from [RFC5424], the VERSION is 1 and the\n   Facility has
    the value of 4.  The severity is 2.  The message was\n   created on 11 October
    2003 at 10:14:15pm UTC, 3 milliseconds into the\n   next second.  The message
    originated from a host that identifies\n   itself as \"mymachine.example.com\".
    \ The APP-NAME is \"evntslog\" and\n   the PROCID is unknown.  The MSGID is \"ID47\".
    \ We have included both\n   the structured data from the original example, a single
    element with\n   the value \"[exampleSDID@32473 iut=\"3\" eventSource=\"Application\"\n
    \  eventID=\"1011\"]\", and a new element with the alarm information\n   defined
    in this memo.  The alarm SD-ID contains the mandatory SD-\n   PARAMS of resource,
    probableCause, and preceivedSeverity.  The MSG\n   itself is \"An application
    event log entry...\"  The BOM at the\n   beginning of the MSG indicates UTF-8
    encoding.\n   Example 2 - Additional Alarm Information\n   <165>1 2004-11-10T20:15:15.003Z

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   In addition to the general syslog security considerations
    discussed\n   in [RFC5424], the information contained with alarms may provide\n
    \  hackers with helpful information about parts of the system currently\n   experiencing
    stress as well as general information about the system,\n   such as inventory.\n
    \  Users should not have access to information in alarms that their\n   normal
    access permissions would not permit if the information were\n   accessed in another
    manner.\n   There is no standardized access control model for syslog, and hence\n
    \  the ability to filter alarms based on a notion of a receiver identity\n   is,
    at best, implementation specific.\n"
