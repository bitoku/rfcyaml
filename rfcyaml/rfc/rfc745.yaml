    \      (Symmetrical, 1822-like Interface)\n1.  INTRODUCTION\n1.1.  Motivation\n\
    A need arose in the Packet Radio project for specification of an\ninterface between\
    \ Packet Radio units and other equipment.  This paper is\nto meet BBN's responsibility\
    \ to supply that specification.  It is our\nhope that it will find application\
    \ in other areas as well.\n1.2.  Historical Relationship to 1822\nThe ARPANET\
    \ employs a network of switching nodes, called IMPs, to\nprovide interconnection\
    \ among user equipment, called hosts.  A uniform\nmeans of connecting a host to\
    \ an IMP is specified in BBN Report Number\n1822.  Consequently, this interface\
    \ has become known as an 1822\ninterface.\nAs the need to interconnect new types\
    \ of devices has grown, it has\nbecome attractive to implement an 1822-like interface\
    \ on each end of\npairs of devices which are to communicate.  The devices are\
    \ then\nconnected electrically, and communication can take place in spite of\n\
    differences in processing speed, word length, signal levels and so forth\nin the\
    \ two devices.  A part of Report 1822 reads as follows.\n   \"The technique of\
    \ transferring information between the Host and the\n   IMP is identical in each\
    \ direction; we will, therefore, refer to the\n   sender and the receiver without\
    \ specifying the Host or IMP\n   explicitly.\"\n   [BBN Report Number 1822, 12/75\
    \ revision, page 4-2.]\nUnfortunately, Report 1822 does not specify a completely\
    \ symmetrical\ninterface.  Although there is a high degree of symmetry, some aspects\n\
    are peculiar to the IMP side and some to the host side.  Therefore, two\ninterfaces\
    \ constructed to connect to IMPs may not function connected to\neach other.  In\
    \ what follows, the unsymmetrical aspects are respecified\nin a way which will\
    \ accomplish full interchangeability.\nThe interface specified here is called\
    \ the JANUS interface, to\ndistinguish it from the Report 1822 interface.\nJANUS\
    \ Interface Specifications\n1.3.  Terminology\nThe terms, \"IMP\" and \"host,\"\
    \ are not relevant in the present context.\nSections of Report 1822 such as Appendix\
    \ B are conveniently\nre-interpreted by substituting \"foreign interface\" and\
    \ \"home interface,\"\nrespectively.\n2.  SPECIFICATIONS\nReport 1822 addresses\
    \ two aspects of the connection of a host to the\nARPANET, the hardware requirements\
    \ and the software protocols.  Since\nthe JANUS interface will typically be used\
    \ in applications other than\nconnection to the ARPANET, the higher level software\
    \ protocols are\nbeyond the scope of this paper. They are properly addressed by\n\
    documentation specific to each application.  Concern here is only for\nelectrical\
    \ specification of the JANUS interface.  The various areas\nwhich differ from\
    \ Report 1822 are as follows.\n2.1.  Low-level Protocol\nCertain aspects of the\
    \ JANUS interface and its operation may be\nimplemented in hardware, software\
    \ of a mixture of the two.  We refer to\nthese aspects as \"low-level protocol.\"\
    \  They are to be distinguished\nfrom such \"high-level protocol\" aspects as\
    \ header definitions and data\nformats.\n2.1.1.  Padding\nRequirement:\nReceived\
    \ messages are padded out to a full word (of the home device's\nsize), if necessary,\
    \ with zeros only.\nDiscussion:\nA one-bit to mark the end of received data, as\
    \ IMPs employ, is NOT used.\nThe mark bit has not proved very useful, although\
    \ the ARPANET IMPs do\nuse it to generate the message length field in the new\
    \ format header.\nRather, counts at one or another level of protocol are generally\
    \ used,\nso the complication of a mark bit can be eliminated.  It is the author's\n\
    impression that the ARPANET will not implement this aspect of\nsymmetrical interfaces,\
    \ so hosts communicating through the ARPANET will\ncontinue to see the marker\
    \ one-bit appended by the source IMP regardless\nof whether the hosts have 1822\
    \ or JANUS interfaces.\n2.1.2.  Message Length\nRequirement:\nA JANUS interface\
    \ must accept messages up to and including 8160 bits\nlong.\nJANUS Interface Specifications\n\
    Exception:\nIf the interface is absolutely never intended for use in\nARPANET-compatible\
    \ applications, this requirement may be relaxed in any\nof three ways.  A smaller\
    \ maximum length may be implemented;  a larger\nmaximum lengthbe implemented;\
    \ or the maximum length may be so large as\nto be in practice infinite.\nDiscussion:\n\
    A JANUS interface may discard messages longer than 8160 bits when used\nwith the\
    \ ARPANET.  This constraint can be enforced in software rather\nthan in hardware,\
    \ if desired.\n2.1.3.  Four-way Handshake\nRequirement:\nThe interface must use\
    \ the four-way handshake.  That is, the receiver\nmust wait until the incoming\
    \ There's-Your-Bit drops before turning on\nReady-For-Next-Bit.\nDiscussion:\n\
    The two-way handshake, presented as an option in Report 1822, must not\nbe used.\
    \  Experience has shown that it is vulnerable to various\nfailures.  First, if\
    \ the off period in RFNB is not seen by the sender\n(due to noise or its being\
    \ too short), a deadlock occurs and no more\ndata is transferred.  Second, a two-way\
    \ receiver cannot talk with a\nstrictly four-way sender, since the sender's next\
    \ assertion of TYB may\ndepend on seeing the RFNB transition to on.  And third,\
    \ the two-way\nhandshake is overly sensitive to transitions, and may be activated\
    \ by\nnoise pulses. Transitions in the two-way handshake may be missed\naltogether\
    \ in a sender implementation which samples the RFNB line only\nat certain intervals.\
    \  The superiority of the more positive four-way\nhandshake is important in applications\
    \ where neither of the\ncommunicating interfaces is necessarily constructed to\
    \ particular\nstandards.\n2.1.4.  Contact Bounce\nRequirement:\nEach interface,\
    \ considered together with the software driving it, must\nprevent data from flowing\
    \ across the interface in either direction while\nits Ready relay contacts may\
    \ be bouncing.  Thus, for 1/10 second after\nraising Ready, the outgoing signals\
    \ There's-Your-Bit and\nReady-For-Next-Bit must not be asserted.\nDiscussion:\n\
    This may be accomplished either in hardware or software, as discussed in\nReport\
    \ 1822 section B.3.  The delay of 1/10 second is specified here to\nresolve an\
    \ ambiguity in Report 1822, concerning whether a shorter delay\nwas acceptable\
    \ if the relay was known to solidly finish closing sooner.\nJANUS Interface Specifications\n\
    Report 1822 specified a 1/2 second delay, but modern reed relays\nreliably finish\
    \ closing in 1/10 second.\n2.1.5.  RFNB, TYB Minimum Off Time\nRequirement:\n\
    Ready-For-Next-Bit must be off for at least 50 nanoseconds for local\nhost connections,\
    \ and at least 1 microsecond for distant host\nconnections, as seen by the receiver\
    \ of the signal (who is the sender of\ndata).  Note that this means that RFNB\
    \ at the cable driver may have to\nbe off for somewhat longer than this minimum\
    \ if deterioration of the\nsignal waveform along the cable is anticipated.  There's-Your-Bit\
    \ must\nsimilarly be off for at least 50 nanoseconds for local host connections,\n\
    and at least 1 microsecond for distant host connections, as seen by the\nreceiver\
    \ of the signal.\nDiscussion:\nThis extends the Report 1822 requirements for signals\
    \ received by the\nIMP, to both interfaces in a JANUS interface pair.\n2.1.6.\
    \  Deskewing\nRequirement:\nThe outgoing data bit must be on the line and the\
    \ Last-Bit level correct\nat least 500 nanoseconds before the sender turns on\
    \ the There's-Your-Bit\nsignal.  The sender must turn off TYB before changing\
    \ either the data or\nthe LB.\nDiscussion:\nThe responsibility for deskewing signals\
    \ rests with the sender in each\ninterface.  This applies the Report 1822 IMP\
    \ sender behavior to each\nJANUS interface as a requirement.  Note that the receiver\
    \ may count on\nthe Last-Bit signal being valid during, and only during, the assertion\n\
    of There's-Your-Bit.  Specifically, Last-Bit must be asserted during\ntransmission\
    \ of the last data bit.  Report 1822 was slightly ambiguous\nin this regard.\n\
    2.1.7.  Transmission Order\nRequirement:\n\"The high-order bit of each word is\
    \ transmitted first.\"  (Report 1822,\nsection 4.1.)\nDiscussion:\nIf a computer\
    \ has addressing modes other than word addressing, such\nunits or bytes are not\
    \ used as units of transmission by the interface.\nFor example, the first bit\
    \ transmitted from or received into a PDP-11 is\nbit 15, the leftmost bit of a\
    \ 16-bit word.  This is repeated here to\nbring it especially to the attention\
    \ of designers.\nJANUS Interface Specifications\n2.2.  Distant Host Electrical\
    \ Requirements\nDiscussion:\nThe paragraphs below specify a Distant Host option\
    \ of the JANUS\ninterface which differs substantially from the 1822 Distant Host\n\
    interface.  Several considerations prompted this change.  Report 1822\nspecifies\
    \ transformer coupling at the receiver, so requirements on\nsignal rise time and\
    \ hold times were made.  To relax these, and to\nachieve greater tolerance to\
    \ differences in ground potential, optical\nisolators are now often used, even\
    \ in 1822 interfaces.  Neither the\nReport 1822 Distant Host driver, nor the driver\
    \ adopted for JANUS,\ngenerate more than 1.0 volt. Commonly available optical\
    \ isolators\nrequire at least 1.1 volts to overcome their forward drop before\
    \ they\nwill operate.  Thus an optical isolator driver is needed in both the\n\
    1822 and the JANUS receivers.  The ground potential difference between\nthe communicating\
    \ interface may exceed the maximum ratings of the input\namplifier, so the input\
    \ circuit must be powered from a floating power\nsupply.  Appropriate DC-DC converters\
    \ for this purpose are available at\nreasonable cost.\n2.2.1.  DH Signal Timing\n\
    Requirement:\nReceiver circuits in distant host interfaces shall be implemented\
    \ with\noptical isolators or other means which are not sensitive to rise and\n\
    hold times, as transformer coupling is.  Therefore, the requirements for\nrise\
    \ and hold times on distant host signals appearing in Report 1822 are\nsuspended.\n\
    2.2.2.  DH Signal Levels and Waveforms\nRequirement:\nSignal levels and waveforms\
    \ at the driver and the receiver shall follow\nthe specifications in EIA standard\
    \ RS-422.  In particular, the driver\nmust supply a differential of at least 2\
    \ and not more than 6 volts;  and\nthe receiver must operate correctly on as small\
    \ a differential as 0.2\nvolts.\n2.2.3.  DH Electrical Isolation\nRequirement:\n\
    The receiver circuit must operate correctly over a common mode voltage\nrange\
    \ of -100 to +100 volts, and must not be permanently damaged by a\ncommon mode\
    \ voltage of from -300 to +300 volts.\nJANUS Interface Specifications\nException:\n\
    If the interface is absolutely never intended for use in an environment\nwhere\
    \ common mode voltage exceeds 7 volts in magnitude, or where the\nvoltage from\
    \ either signal wire to the signal ground exceeds 10 volts in\nmagnitude, then\
    \ the electrical isolation required in this paragraph may\nbe suspended, and the\
    \ corresponding requirements of EIA specification\nRS-422 applied in its place.\
    \  Such an implementation is explicitly an\nexceptional JANUS interface, and is\
    \ not the standard JANUS interface.\nDiscussion:\nA suggested way to achieve this\
    \ isolation is an RS-422 receiver chip,\nsuch as the Motorola MC3487 or the Advanced\
    \ Micro Devices Am26LS32,\nfollowed by an LED driver as needed, followed by an\
    \ optical isolator\nsuch as the Hewlett-Packard 5082-4360.  The receivers and\
    \ LED drivers\nfor all input lines may be powered from one source, but this power\
    \ must\nbe floated with respect to ground of the home interface.\n2.2.4.  DH Cable\
    \ Shield Grounding\nRequirement:\nAt each end the cable shield in a distant host\
    \ connection shall be\nconnected through a circuit described below to signal ground.\
    \ The\ncircuit consists of two components connected in parallel. (1) A 100K,\n\
    1/8 watt resistor provides a path to leak off slow accumulations of\nstatic charge.\n\
    (2) A .01 mfd, 600 V ceramic capacitor bypasses sharp noise spikes.\nException:\n\
    In cases of severe noise, one end of the shield or the other (but not\nboth!)\
    \ may have to be tied directly to ground, sacrificing the symmetry.\nDiscussion:\n\
    Grounding the cable shield only at the host end, as in Report 1822, is\nundefined\
    \ when the interface is symmetrical.  Instead, the circuit above\nwill be used.\n\
    2.2.5.  DH Cable\nRequirement:\nCable requirements in EIA specification RS-422\
    \ must be followed with\nrespect to quality and electrical characteristics, and\
    \ those in Report\n1822 with respect to number of conductors.  In particular,\
    \ at least 10\ntwisted pairs with impedance of approximately 100 ohms must be\
    \ supplied.\nJANUS Interface Specifications\nDiscussion:\nA suitable cable is\
    \ PE-39, described in REA Bulletin 345-67. This cable\nis similar to that mass\
    \ produced for telephone cable, which is of good,\nuniform quality, and readily\
    \ available at reasonable cost.  The cable\nspecified in Report 1822 is not as\
    \ desirable.  Note the change in\nspecified characteristic impedance:  Report\
    \ 1822 specified 120 ohms,\nwhile the JANUS interfaces follow RS-422 with 100\
    \ ohms.\n2.2.6.  DH Cable Termination\nRequirement:\nTermination shall be as specified\
    \ in RS-422, in particular at the\nreceiver.  Termination as in Report 1822, at\
    \ the driver, shall NOT be\nused.\nDiscussion:\nThe source-end termination specified\
    \ in Report 1822 was to eliminate the\nvoltage drop caused by the cable's series\
    \ resistance.  RS-422 explicitly\nallows for this sort of signal attenuation as\
    \ a part of the\nspecification.\n3.  STRONG RECOMMENDATIONS\n3.1.  Local Host\
    \ Signal Levels\nSuggested voltage levels for local host drivers and receivers\
    \ are given\nbelow.  The levels below are a combination of Report 1822 levels\
    \ for\n316/516 and Pluribus machines.  The intent here is to be compatible with\n\
    readily available TTL components.  Suggested chips are the 7440 for a\ndriver\
    \ and the 7420 for a receiver. Note that signals may go up to 6\nvolts, which\
    \ may damage receiving circuits constructed of normal 5-volt\nlogic.  Such receivers\
    \ should have a voltage divider on their inputs.\n   driver output voltage\n \
    \       with input = 0:    -   min,  0.35 max  (0.07 typical)\n        with input\
    \ = 1:   3.5  min,  6.0  max  (5.0  typical)\n   receiver input voltage\n    \
    \    to assume a binary 0:   0.6  min  (0.9  typical)\n        to assume a binary\
    \ 1:   2.5  max  (1.7  typical)\n        maximum input rating:   6.0  max\nCable\
    \ impedance and termination circuits are covered in Report 1822.\nWith properly\
    \ chosen cable and well designed circuits, and with\nimpedances matched, local\
    \ host connections may operate considerably\nfarther than the 30 feet given in\
    \ Report 1822. Cables as long as 300\nfeet are in use communicating with ARPANET\
    \ IMPs.  For example, 300 foot\ncables have worked using 7440's as drivers, standard\
    \ TTL gates as\nreceivers, cable termination (on all signal lines) of a diode\
    \ to ground\nand a diode to +3 volts, and RG174/U cable.  RG174/U is 50 ohm coax,\
    \ and\na 100 ohm coax is preferred, to reduce ringing.\nJANUS Interface Specifications\n\
    3.2.  Use of the Ready Line\nIt is strongly recommended that the Ready Line provided\
    \ by the hardware\nbe used by the software in a manner similar or identical to\
    \ that\ndescribed in Report 1822.  Report 1822 sections 3.2, 4.4 and Appendix\
    \ B\nespecially bear on this topic.  In particular, the software design\nshould\
    \ provide for the following:\n   (1) A ready indicator (relay) which tells the\
    \ foreign interface that\n       the home interface and software are ready to\
    \ communicate.\n   (2) An \"error\" flip-flop which tells the home software that\
    \ the\n       foreign interface has been not ready.\n   (3) NOP messages which\
    \ are used to purge the communication \"pipe\"\n       after the ready line has\
    \ \"flapped\" down and back up.\n4.  ADVICE ON DELAYS TO LIMIT BANDWIDTH\nIt is\
    \ advisable to include adjustable delays whose function is to limit\nthe maximum\
    \ bandwidth of transfers, as discussed in Report 1822.  Only\nwhen the details\
    \ (such as cable characteristics, memory speed, and\nacceptable memory utilization)\
    \ of a specific application guarantee that\nan unregulated transfer rate will\
    \ be acceptable can these delays be\nomitted.  Two delays are involved, one in\
    \ the sender circuit and one in\nthe receiver circuit.  The sender delays up to\
    \ 10 microseconds\n(adjustable) from when the foreign interface drops Ready-For-Next-Bit,\n\
    before again turning on There's-Your-Bit.  (This is the sum of delays C\nand D\
    \ in Report 1822 Fig. B-1.)  The receiver delays up to 10\nmicroseconds (adjustable)\
    \ from when the foreign interface asserts\nThere's-Your-Bit, before again turning\
    \ on Ready-For-Next-Bit. (This is\nthe sum of delays A and B in Report 1822 Fig.\
    \ B-2.) When delivered,\ninterfaces should have these delays set at approximately\
    \ the maximum\ndelay.  The timing is shown below.\nJANUS Interface Specifications\n\

    5.  INTER-OPERABILITY WITH 1822 INTERFACES\nProtocol specifications have been\
    \ chosen which are compatible with\nReport 1822.  Actually, the protocol areas\
    \ discussed above are further\nclarification of Report 1822, rather than any change\
    \ from it.  The\nelectrical specifications differ only slightly from the 1822\
    \ interface.\nThe local host levels chosen are 1822 compatible.  The potential\n\
    difficulties in using a JANUS interface cabled to an 1822 interface\narise with\
    \ the distant host interface.\nThe distant host cable for a JANUS interface is\
    \ 100 ohms nominal\nimpedance, compared to 120 ohms for the 1822 interface.  This\
    \ difference\nis small enough that most applications will work with either cable,\
    \ or\neven with some 100 ohm cable and some 120 ohm cable.\nThe 1822 distant host\
    \ interface does not provide as much electrical\nisolation as the standard JANUS\
    \ distant host interface.  Thus, in cases\nof severe common mode noise or ground\
    \ potential difference, two JANUS\ninterfaces might operate correctly, but an\
    \ 1822 interface might\nmisbehave or burn out.\nThe JANUS distant host driver\
    \ yields 2 to 6 volts output, and its\nreceiver requires 0.2 volts input; the\
    \ 1822 distant host driver yields\n1.0 volt output, and its receiver requires\
    \ 0.1 volt input. Unless there\nis a significant signal loss in the cable, the\
    \ 1822 driver will drive a\nJANUS receiver acceptably.  On the other hand, the\
    \ maximum input to an\n1822 receiver is 4.0 volts.  Thus a JANUS driver might\
    \ overdrive an 1822\nreceiver.  The simplest fix for this is to put a (balanced)\
    \ voltage\ndivider at the 1822 receiver, or at the JANUS driver.  The divider\n\
    should cut down the maximum voltage from 6 volts to 4 volts, or a\nreduction of\
    \ 1/3.\nJANUS Interface Specifications\nThe above differences are relatively minor,\
    \ so in most applications an\ninterconnected 1822 interface and a JANUS interface\
    \ should operate\ncorrectly.  Attention must be paid to the electrical isolation\n\
    susceptibility of the 1822, and to its maximum input voltage.\n6.  MILITARY COMPATIBILITY\n\
    The EIA specification RS-422 chosen as a base for the JANUS interface\ndistant\
    \ host electrical characteristics is compatible with military\nspecification MIL-188-114.\n\
    The common mode voltage tolerance of the JANUS interface provides\nsignificant\
    \ protection against widely varying ground potentials in field\nequipment separated\
    \ by distances of thousands of feet.\n7.  REFERENCES\n\"Specifications for the\
