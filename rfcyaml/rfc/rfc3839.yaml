  - "Abstract\n   This document serves to register and document the standard MIME
    types\n   associated with the 3GPP multimedia file format, which is part of the\n
    \  family based on the ISO Media File Format.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119\n
    \  [RFC2119].\n   The third-generation partnership project (3GPP) for third-generation\n
    \  cellular telephony has defined a standard file format to contain\n   audio/visual
    sequences which may be downloaded to cellular phones\n   [3GPP].  At the time
    of writing, the 3GPP file format (3GP) can\n   contain H.263 or MPEG-4 video,
    and AMR Narrow-band speech, AMR wide-\n   band speech, or AAC audio, and 3GPP
    timed text.\n   Within the file, as with all files in the 'ISO' family, there
    is an\n   intrinsic file-type box, which identifies those specifications to\n
    \  which the file complies, and which players (possibly compliant with\n   only
    one specification) are permitted by the content author to play\n   the file.  This
    identification is through four-letter 'brands'.\n   Files identified by the MIME
    [MIME1] type defined here MUST contain a\n   brand defined in a standard issued
    by 3GPP that can apply to 3GPP\n   files, in their compatible brands list.\n   The
    MIME types defined here are needed to correctly identify such\n   files when they
    are served over HTTP, included in multi-part\n   documents, or used in other places
    where MIME types are used.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   The 3GPP file format may contain audio, video,
    and displayable text\n   data.  There is currently no provision for 'active' elements
    (such as\n   scripts) of any kind.\n   Clearly it is possible to author malicious
    files which attempt to\n   call for an excessively large picture size, high sampling-rate
    audio\n   etc.  However, clients can and usually do protect themselves against\n
    \  this kind of attack.\n   It should be noted that selected metadata fields may
    encompass\n   information partly intended to protect the media against unauthorized\n
    \  use or distribution.  In this case, the intention is that alteration\n   or
    removal of the data in the field would be treated as an offense\n   under national
    agreements based on World Intellectual Property\n   Organization (WIPO) treaties.\n
    \  3GPP files have an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically\n   possible
    that metadata fields or media formats could be defined in\n   the future which
    could be used to induce particular actions on the\n   part of the recipient, thus
    presenting additional security risks.\n   However, this type of capability is
    currently not supported in the\n   referenced specification.\n   There is no current
    provision in the standards for encryption,\n   signing, or authentication of these
    file formats.\n"
