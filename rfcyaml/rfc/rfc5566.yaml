  - "1.  Introduction\n   The BGP [RFC4271] Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family
    Identifier\n   (SAFI) allows for the communication of tunnel information and for
    the\n   association of this information to a BGP next hop.  The Encapsulation\n
    \  SAFI can be used to support the mapping of prefixes to next hops and\n   tunnels
    of the same address family, IPv6 prefixes to IPv4 next hops\n   and tunnels using
    [RFC4798], and IPv4 prefixes to IPv6 next hops and\n   tunnels using [RFC5549].
    \ The Encapsulation SAFI can also be used to\n   support the mapping of VPN prefixes
    to tunnels when VPN prefixes are\n   advertised per [RFC4364] or [RFC4659].  [RFC5565]
    provides useful\n   context for the use of the Encapsulation SAFI.\n   The Encapsulation
    SAFI is defined in [RFC5512].  [RFC5512] also\n   defines support for the GRE
    [RFC2784], L2TPv3 [RFC3931], and IP in IP\n   [RFC2003] tunnel types.  This document
    builds on [RFC5512] and\n   defines support for IPsec tunnels.  Support is defined
    for IP\n   Authentication Header (AH) in tunnel mode [RFC4302] and for IP\n   Encapsulating
    Security Payload (ESP) in tunnel mode [RFC4303].  The\n   IPsec architecture is
    defined in [RFC4301].  Support for IP in IP\n   [RFC2003] and MPLS-in-IP [RFC4023]
    protected by IPsec Transport Mode\n   is also defined.\n   The Encapsulation Network
    Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)\n   Format is not modified by this document.\n"

  - "2.  Tunnel Encapsulation Types\n   Per [RFC5512], tunnel type is indicated in
    the Tunnel Encapsulation\n   attribute.  This document defines the following tunnel
    type values:\n     - Transmit tunnel endpoint: Tunnel Type = 3\n     - IPsec in
    Tunnel-mode: Tunnel Type = 4 [RFC4302], [RFC4303]\n     - IP in IP Tunnel with
    IPsec Transport Mode: Tunnel Type = 5\n       [RFC2003], [RFC4303]\n     - MPLS-in-IP
    Tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode: Tunnel Type = 6\n       [RFC4023]\n       Note,
    see Section 4.3 of [RFC5512] for a discussion on the\n       advertisement and
    use of multiple tunnel types.\n       Note, the specification in [RFC4023] for
    MPLS-in-IP tunnels with\n       IPsec Transport mode applies as well to IP in
    IP tunnels.\n   This document does not specify the use of the sub-TLV types defined\n
    \  in [RFC5512] with these tunnel types.  See below for the definition\n   of
    a specific sub-TLV for use with the defined tunnel types.\n"
  title: 2.  Tunnel Encapsulation Types
- contents:
  - "3.  Use of IPsec Tunnel Types\n   The IPsec tunnel types are defined above with
    the values 4, 5, and 6.\n   If R1 is a BGP speaker that receives an Encapsulation
    SAFI update\n   from another BGP speaker, R2, then if R1 has any data packets
    for\n   which R2 is the BGP next hop, R1 MUST initiate an IPsec SA (security\n
    \  association) of the specified \"tunnel type\", and all such data\n   packets
    MUST be sent through that SA.\n   Let R1 and R2 be two BGP speakers that may send
    data packets through\n   R3, such that the data packets from R1 and from R2 may
    be received by\n   R3 over the same interface.  In this case, when R3 sends an\n
    \  Encapsulation SAFI that indicates an IPsec tunnel type to R2, then R3\n   SHOULD
    also send an update specifying an Encapsulation SAFI with an\n   IPsec tunnel
    type to R1.  That is, on a given interface, if IPsec is\n   required for any data
    packets, it SHOULD be required for all.  This\n   eliminates dependence on the
    IPsec selector mechanisms to correctly\n   distinguish traffic that needs to be
    protected from traffic that does\n   not.\n   Security policy has the granularity
    of BGP speaker to BGP speaker.\n   The required security policies must be configured
    into the BGP\n   speakers.  Policies for each SA will typically be established
    using\n   IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange) [RFC4306], with either public-key or\n
    \  pre-shared key authentication.  The SA MAY also be configured via\n   manual
    techniques.  Manual configuration specification and\n   considerations are defined
    in [RFC4301], [RFC4302], and [RFC4303]\n   (and includes keys, Security Parameter
    Index (SPI) numbers, IPsec\n   protocol, integrity/encryption algorithms, and
    sequence number mode).\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV\n   This document defines a new sub-TLV
    for use with the Tunnel\n   Encapsulation attribute defined in [RFC5512].  The
    new sub-TLV is\n   referred to as the \"IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV\",
    and one or\n   more of the sub-TLVs MAY be included in any Encapsulation SAFI
    NLRI\n   [RFC5512] indicating a tunnel type defined in this document.  Support\n
    \  for the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV MUST be implemented\n   whenever
    the tunnel types defined in this document are implemented.\n   However, its use
    is OPTIONAL, and is a matter of policy.\n   The sub-TLV type of the IPsec Tunnel
    Authenticator sub-TLV is 3.  The\n   sub-TLV length is variable.  The structure
    of the sub-TLV is as\n   follows:\n     - Authenticator Type: two octets\n       This
    document defines authenticator type 1, \"SHA-1 hash of public\n       key\", as
    defined in Section 3.7 of RFC 4306.\n     - Value: (variable)\n       A value
    used to authenticate the BGP speaker that generated this\n       NLRI.  The length
    of this field is not encoded explicitly, but\n       can be calculated as (sub-TLV
    length - 2).\n       In the case of authenticator type 1, this field contains
    the\n       20-octet value of the hash.\n   A BGP speaker that sends the IPsec
    Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV with\n   authenticator type 1 MUST be configured
    with a private key / public\n   key pair, the public key being the key whose hash
    is sent in the\n   value field of the sub-TLV.  The BGP speaker MUST either (a)
    be able\n   to generate a self-signed certificate for the public key, or else
    (b)\n   be configured with a certificate for the public key.\n   When the IPsec
    Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV is used, it is highly\n   RECOMMENDED that the integrity
    of the BGP session itself be\n   protected.  This is usually done by using the
    TCP MD5 option\n   [RFC2385].\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Use of the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV\n   If an IPsec Tunnel
      Authenticator sub-TLV with authenticator type 1 is\n   present in the Encapsulation
      SAFI update, then R1 (as defined above\n   in Section 3) MUST use IKEv2 [RFC4306]
      to obtain a certificate from\n   R2 (as defined above in Section 3), and R2
      MUST send a certificate\n   for the public key whose hash occurred in the value
      field of the\n   IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV.  R1 MUST NOT attempt to
      establish\n   an SA to R2 UNLESS the public key in the certificate hashes to
      the\n   same value that occurs in one of the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-\n
      \  TLVs.\n   R2 MUST also perform the reciprocal processing.  Specifically,
      when\n   establishing an SA from R1 and R1 has advertised the IPsec Tunnel\n
      \  Authenticator sub-TLV with authenticator type 1, R2 MUST use IKEv2\n   [RFC4306]
      to obtain a certificate from R1, and R1 MUST send a\n   certificate for the
      public key whose hash occurred in the value field\n   of the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator
      sub-TLV.  R2 MUST NOT attempt to\n   establish an SA to R1 UNLESS the public
      key in the certificate hashes\n   to the same value that occurs in one of the
      IPsec Tunnel\n   Authenticator sub-TLVs.\n   Note that the \"Transmit tunnel
      endpoint\" tunnel type (value = 3) may\n   be used by a BGP speaker that does
      not want to be the receiving\n   endpoint of an IPsec tunnel but only the transmitting
      endpoint.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document uses IP-based tunnel technologies
    to support data plane\n   transport.  Consequently, the security considerations
    of those tunnel\n   technologies apply.  This document defines support for IPsec
    AH\n   [RFC4302] and ESP [RFC4303].  The security considerations from those\n
    \  documents as well as [RFC4301] apply to the data plane aspects of\n   this
    document.\n   As with [RFC5512], any modification of the information that is used\n
    \  to form encapsulation headers, to choose a tunnel type, or to choose\n   a
    particular tunnel for a particular payload type may lead to user\n   data packets
    getting misrouted, misdelivered, and/or dropped.\n   Misdelivery is less of an
    issue when IPsec is used, as such\n   misdelivery is likely to result in a failure
    of authentication or\n   decryption at the receiver.  Furthermore, in environments
    where\n   authentication of BGP speakers is desired, the IPsec Tunnel\n   Authenticator
    sub-TLV defined in Section 4 may be used.\n   More broadly, the security considerations
    for the transport of IP\n   reachability information using BGP are discussed in
    [RFC4271] and\n   [RFC4272], and are equally applicable for the extensions described
    in\n   this document.\n   If the integrity of the BGP session is not itself protected,
    then an\n   imposter could mount a denial-of-service attack by establishing\n
    \  numerous BGP sessions and forcing an IPsec SA to be created for each\n   one.
    \ However, as such an imposter could wreak havoc on the entire\n   routing system,
    this particular sort of attack is probably not of any\n   special importance.\n
    \  It should be noted that a BGP session may itself be transported over\n   an
    IPsec tunnel.  Such IPsec tunnels can provide additional security\n   to a BGP
    session.  The management of such IPsec tunnels is outside\n   the scope of this
    document.\n"
