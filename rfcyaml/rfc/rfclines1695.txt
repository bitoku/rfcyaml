This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing ATM based interfaces, devices, networks and services.
This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1 definitions.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
They are: 0    RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management. 0
[2] defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols. 0
RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework. 0
RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to the object type.
Some basic ATM terminologies are described in this section to facilitate defining the ATM managed objects.
There are two distinct types of ATM virtual connections: Virtual Channel Connections (VCCs) and Virtual Path Connection (VPCs).
As shown in Figures 1 and 2, ATM virtual connections consist of concatenated series of virtual links which forms a path between two end points, with each concatenation occurring at an ATM switch.
Virtual links of VCCs are called Virtual Channel Links (VCLs).
Virtual links of VPCs are called Virtual Path Links (VPLs).
The VCI and VPI fields in the ATM cell header associate each cell of a VCC with a particular VCL over a given physical link.
The VPI field in the ATM cell header associates each cell of a VPC with a particular VPL over a given physical link.
Switches route cells between VCLs (or VPLs) via a cross connect function according to the cells' VCI/VPI (or VPI) values.
ATM Switch Figure 2: Virtual Path Links and Virtual Path Connection
A single ATM end system or switch does not support the whole end to  end span of a VCC (or VPC).
Rather, multiple ATM end  systems and/or switches each support one piece of the VCC (or VPC).
That is, each ATM end system at one end of the VCC/VPC supports its end of the VCC/VPC  plus the VCLs or VPLs on its external interfaces, and each switch through which the VCC/VPC passes, supports the multiple VCLs/VPLs on that switch's external interfaces and the cross  connection of those
Thus, the end  to end management of a VCC or VPC is achieved only by appropriate management of its individual pieces in combination.
Note that for management purposes, an ATM network may be viewed as a large distributed switch by hiding all the network's internal connectivity as being internal to the distributed switch (as shown in Figure 2a).
This model may for example be used for Customer Network Management (CNM) purposes.
ATM Network modeled as a large distributed switch
A VCC has a set of traffic characteristics (i.e., bandwidth parameters, QoS Class parameters, etc.).
VCLs inherit their traffic characteristics from the VCC of which they are a part.
VCCs are bi  directional by definition.
However, the traffic parameters in the two directions of a connection can be symmetric or asymmetric, i.e., the two directions can have the same or different traffic flows.
A uni directional traffic flow across a VCC is achieved by assigning a zero bandwidth in one direction.
Note that in addition to the bandwidth required by the user traffic flow, bandwidth is also required for OAM cell flows, even for the zero bandwidth direction of a uni directional connection.
These same principles apply to VPCs.
PVC and SVC A Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) is a provisioned VCC or VPC.
A Switched Virtual Connection (SVC) is a switched VCC or VPC that is set up in real time via call set up signaling procedures.
A PVC (or an SVC) can be a point to point, point to multipoint, or multipoint  to multipoint VCC or VPC.
Traffic Policing and Traffic Shaping Parameters
In order to allocate resources fairly among different users, some networks police traffic at resource access points.
The traffic enforcement or policing taken at a UNI is called Usage Parameter Control (UPC) and is activated on an incoming VCL or VPL as shown in Figure 3.
The use of the traffic enforcer at the ingress of the connection is to make sure that the user traffic does not exceed the negotiated traffic parameters such as the peak cell rate associated with a specific traffic descriptor type.
An Example of a UPC
In addition, traffic shaping may be performed on an outgoing VPL or VCL at a given ATM interface.
The function of the ATM traffic shaper either at the source or an egress point of the connection is to smooth the outgoing cell traffic inter arrival time.
If policing or shaping is not performed then the policing or shaping algorithm is not activated.
ATM Forum has specified seven traffic descriptor types including one for the best effort traffic [9].
To prioritize traffic during resource congestion, ATM cells are assigned one of the two types of Cell Loss Priority (CLP), CLP 0 and CLP 1.
ATM cells with CLP 0 have a higher priority in regard to cell loss than ATM cells with CLP 1.
Therefore, during resource congestions, CLP 1 cells are dropped before any CLP 0 cell is dropped.
QoS Class A VCC or VPC is associated with one of a number of Quality of Service (QoS) classes.
The following service classes have been specified: Service Class A: Constant bit rate video and Circuit emulation Service Class B: Variable bit rate video/audio Service Class C: Connection oriented data Service Class D:
Four QoS classes numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been specified with the aim of supporting service classes A, B, C, and D respectively.
The VCLs (or VPLs) concatenated to form a VCC (or VPC) will all have the same QoS class as that of the VCC (or VPC).
The Cell Loss Ratio (CLR), Cell Delay Variation (CDV), and end to end Cell Delay (CD) parameters are defined as part of QoS Class definition.
In addition, an unspecified QoS Class numbered 0 is specified for best effort traffic.
Overview ATM management objects are used to manage ATM interfaces, ATM virtual links,  ATM cross connects, AAL5 entities and AAL5 connections supported by ATM hosts, ATM switches and ATM networks.
This section provides an overview and background of how to use this MIB and other potential MIBs for this purpose.
The purpose of this memo is primarily to manage ATM PVCs.
ATM SVCs are also represented by the management information in this MIB.
However, full management of SVCs may require additional capabilities which are beyond the scope of this memo.
In addition to the MIB module defined in this memo, other MIB modules are necessary to manage ATM interfaces, links and cross connects.
Examples include MIB II for general system and interface management (RFC 1213 and RFC 1573), the DS3 or SONET MIBs for management of physical interfaces, and, as appropriate, MIB modules for applications that make use of ATM, such as SMDS.
These MIB modules are outside the scope of this specification.
The current specification of this ATM MIB is based on SNMPv2.
The managed ATM objects are arranged into the following groups: (1) ATM interface configuration group (2)
ATM interface DS3 PLCP group (3)
ATM interface TC Sublayer group (4)
ATM interface virtual link (VPL/VCL) configuration groups (5)
ATM VP/VC cross connect groups (6)
AAL5 connection performance statistics group Note that, managed objects for activation/deactivation of OAM cell flows and ATM traps notifying virtual connection or virtual link failures are outside the scope of this memo.
This group contains information on ATM cell layer configuration of local ATM interfaces on an ATM device in addition to the information on such interfaces contained in the ifTable.
ATM Interface DS3 PLCP and TC Layer Groups
These groups provide performance statistics of the DS3 PLCP and TC sublayer of local ATM interfaces on a managed ATM device.
DS3 PLCP and TC sublayer are currently used to carry ATM cells respectively over DS3 and SONET transmission paths.
ATM Virtual Link and Cross Connect Groups
ATM virtual link and cross connect groups model bi directional ATM virtual links and ATM cross connects.
The ATM VP/VC link groups are implemented in an ATM host, ATM switch and ATM network.
The ATM switch and ATM network also implement the ATM VP/VC cross connect groups.
Both link and cross connect groups are implemented in a carrier's network for Customer Network Management (CNM) purposes.
The ATM virtual link groups are used to create, delete or modify ATM virtual links in an ATM host, ATM switch and ATM network.
ATM virtual link groups along with the cross connect groups are used to create, delete or modify ATM cross connects in an ATM switch or ATM network (
Application of MIB II to ATM 6.1.
For the purposes of the sysServices object in the System Group of MIB II [2], ATM is a data link layer protocol.
Thus, for ATM switches and ATM networks, sysServices will have the value "2".
The Interface Group The Interfaces Group of MIB II defines generic managed objects for managing interfaces.
This memo contains the media specific extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing ATM interfaces.
This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be in accordance with [5] which states that the interfaces table (ifTable) contains information on the managed resource's interfaces and that each sub layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface is considered an interface.
Thus, the ATM cell layer interface is represented as an entry in the ifTable.
This entry is concerned with the ATM cell layer as a whole, and not with individual virtual connections which are managed via the ATM specific managed objects specified in this memo.
The inter relation of entries in the ifTable is defined by Interfaces Stack Group defined in [5].
Support of the ATM Cell Layer by ifTable
Some specific interpretations of ifTable for the ATM cell layer follow.
Each ATM port is represented by an ifEntry.
ifDescr    Description of the ATM interface.
The total bandwidth in bits per second for use by the ATM layer.
The interface's address at the ATM protocol sublayer; the ATM address which would be used as the value of the Called Party Address Information Element (IE) of a signalling message for a connection which either: would terminate at this interface, or for which the Called Party Address IE would need to be replaced by the Called Party SubAddress IE before the message was forwarded to any other interface.
For an interface on which signalling is not supported, then the interface does not necessarily have an address, but if it does, then ifPhysAddress is the address which would be used as above in the event that signalling were supported.
If the interface has multiple such addresses, then ifPhysAddress is its primary address.
If the interface has no addresses, then ifPhysAddress is an octet string of zero length.
Address encoding is as per [9].
Note that addresses assigned for purposes other than those listed above (e.g., an address associated with the service provider side of a public network UNI) may be represented through atmInterfaceAdminAddress.
down(2) if the ATM cell layer or any layer below that layer is down.
The number of received octets over the interface, i.e., the number of received, assigned cells multiplied by 53.
The number of transmitted octets over the interface, i.e., the number of transmitted, assigned cells multiplied by 53.
The number of cells dropped due to uncorrectable HEC errors.
The number of received cells discarded during cell header validation, including cells with unrecognized VPI/VCI values, and cells with invalid cell header patterns.
If cells with undefined PTI values are discarded, they are also counted here.
ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable  Default is disabled (2).
The 64 bit version of ifInOctets; supported if required by the compliance statements in [5].
The 64 bit version of ifOutOctets; supported if required by the compliance statements in [5].
For the management of AAL3/4 CPCS layer, see [6].
Support of the AAL5 Managed Objects Support of AAL5 managed objects in an ATM switch and ATM host are described below.
Managing AAL5 in a Switch Managing AAL5 in a switch involves: (1) performance management of an AAL5 entity as an internal resource in a switch (2) performance management of AAL5 per virtual connection AAL5 in a switch is modeled as shown in Figures 4 and 5.
AAL5 will be managed in a switch for only those virtual connections that carry AAL5 and are terminated at the AAL5 entity in the switch.
Note that, the virtual channels within the ATM UNIs carrying AAL5 will be switched by the ATM switching fabric (termed as ATM Entity in the figure) to the virtual channels on a proprietary internal interface associated with the AAL5 process (termed as AAL5 Entity in the figure).
Therefore, performance management of the AAL5 resource in the switch will be modeled using the ifTable through an internal (pseudo ATM) virtual interface and the AAL5 performance management per virtual connection will be supported using an additional AAL5 connection table in the ATM MIB.
The association between the AAL5 virtual link at the proprietary virtual, internal interface and the ATM virtual link at the ATM interface will be derived from the virtual channel cross connect table and the virtual channel link table in the ATM MIB.
AAL5 Entity's Interface Stack in a Switch 8.2.
Managing AAL5 in a Host Managing AAL5 in a host involves managing the AAL5 sublayer interface as shown in Figures 6 and 7.
The AAL5 sublayer is stacked directly over the ATM sublayer.
The ifTable is applied to the AAL5 sublayer as defined in Section 8.3.
AAL5 Entity's Interface Stack in a Host 8.3.
Support of AAL5 by ifTable
The AAL5 entity in an ATM device (e.g., switch or host) is managed using the ifTable.
There are additional counters specified for AAL5 than those specified in the ATM B ICI document [10].
Specific interpretations of ifTable for the AAL5 CPCS layer are as follows.
Each AAL5 entity is represented by an ifEntry.
ifDescr  Description of the AAL5 entity.
The value that is allocated for AAL5 is 49.
ifMtu    Set to the largest PDU size for the AAL5 CPCS layer that can be processed by the AAL5 entity.
An octet string of zero length.
down(2) if the AAL5 or any layer below that layer is down.
The number of received AAL5 CPCS PDU octets.
The number of AAL5 CPCS PDU octets transmitted.
The number of received AAL5 CPCS PDUs passed to a higher layer.
The number of AAL5 CPCS PDUs received from a higher layer for transmission.
The number of AAL5 PDUs actually transmitted is the number received from a higher layer for transmission minus any which are counted by ifOutErrors and ifOutDiscards.]
The types of errors counted include  CRC 32 errors, SAR time out errors, and oversized SDU errors.
ifInDiscards    Number of received AAL5 CPCS PDUs discarded.
Possible reason may be input buffer overflow.
Number of AAL5 CPCS PDUs received for transmission that are discarded.
Possible reason may be output buffer overflow.
ifName   Textual name (unique on this system) of the AAL5 entity or an octet string of zero length.
Support of Proprietary Virtual Interface by ifTable Specific interpretations of ifTable for the proprietary virtual, internal interface associated with an AAL5 entity in an ATM switch are as follows.
Each proprietary virtual, internal interface associated with AAL entities is represented by an ifEntry.
ifDescr  Description of the proprietary virtual, internal interface associated with AAL entities.
The value that is allocated for proprietary virtual, internal interface is 53.
Set to 0 if the speed is not known.
An octet string of zero length if no address is used for this interface.
ifName   Textual name (unique on this system) of the interface or an octet string of zero length.
Set to 0 if the speed is not known.
AAL5 Connection Performance Statistics Group An AAL5 connection table is used to provide AAL5 performance information for each AAL5 virtual connection that is terminated at the AAL5 entity contained within an ATM switch or host.
ILMI MIB and the ATM Managed Objects
The ILMI MIB is specified by the ATM Forum in UNI specification [9], to manage local ATM UNIs.
The support of the ATM management functions by the ILMI MIB and those contained in this memo are compared in Table 1.
In this table, "yes" in the "ILMI MIB"  column indicates that the management functions are supported by the ILMI MIB.
The MIB groups in the "This memo" column are the groups listed in Section 5.2.
For that subset of management information which the ILMI MIB and this memo have in common, every effort has been made to retain identical semantics and syntax, even though the MIB objects are identified using different OBJECT IDENTIFIERs.

The operational, administrative, and last change status of the ATM interface and the physical transmission type shall be supported by the interface table in MIB II (RFC 1213, RFC 1573).
ILMI does not contain the administrative and last change status of the ATM interface.
The ILMI MIB does not contain information on the ATM address type and the ATM administrative address assigned at the ATM interface.
The ILMI MIB contains local and end to end operational status of the VPC/VCC segment.
However, it does not contain the VPC/VCC administrative and last change status and the VCC AAL information.

This group contains a set of self consistent   ATM traffic parameters including the   ATM traffic QoS Class.
The ATM virtual link tables (i.e., VPL and VCL tables)   will use this ATM Traffic Descriptor table   to assign traffic parameters and QoS Class   to the receive and transmit directions of   the ATM virtual links (i.e., VPLs and VCLs).
The ATM VPL or VCL table will indicate a row   in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable   using its atmTrafficDescrParamIndex value.
The management application can then compare a set of   ATM traffic parameters with a single value.
If no suitable row(s) in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable   exists, the manager must create a new row(s) in this   table.
If such a row is created, agent checks the   sanity of that set of ATM traffic parameter values.
When creating a new row, the parameter values   will be checked for self consistency.
Predefined/template rows may be supported.
A row in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable is deleted   by setting the atmTrafficDescrRowStatus to destroy(6).
The agent will check whether this row is still in use   by any entry of the atmVplTable or atmVclTable.

directional VPL is modeled as one entry in this table."
{ atmMIBObjects 6} atmVplEntry    OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
An entry in the VPL table.
This entry is used to model a bi directional VPL.
To create a VPL at an ATM interface, either of the following procedures are used: Negotiated VPL establishment (1)
The management application creates a VPL entry in the atmVplTable by setting atmVplRowStatus to createAndWait(5).
This may fail for the following reasons: The selected VPI value is unavailable, The selected VPI value is in use.
Otherwise, the agent creates a row and reserves the VPI value on that port.
The manager selects an existing row(s) in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable, thereby, selecting a set of self consistent ATM traffic parameters and the QoS Class for receive and transmit directions of the VPL.
If no suitable row(s) in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable exists, the manager must create a new row(s) in that table.
The manager characterizes the VPL's traffic parameters through setting the atmVplReceiveTrafficDescrIndex and the atmVplTransmitTrafficDescrIndex values in the VPL table, which point to the rows containing desired ATM traffic parameter values in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable.
The agent will check the availability of resources and may refuse the request.
The manager activates the VPL by setting the the atmVplRowStatus to active(1).
If this set is successful, the agent has reserved the resources to satisfy the requested traffic parameter values and the QoS Class for that VPL.
If the VPL terminates a VPC in the ATM host or switch, the manager turns on the atmVplAdminStatus to up(1) to turn the VPL traffic flow on.
Otherwise, the atmVpCrossConnectTable  must be used to cross connect the VPL to another VPL(s) in an ATM switch or network.
VPL Establishment A VPL may also be established in one step by a set request with all necessary VPL parameter values and atmVplRowStatus set to createAndGo(4).
In contrast to the negotiated VPL establishment which allows for detailed error checking (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to particular resource acquisition failures), the one shot VPL establishment performs the setup on one operation but does not have the advantage of step wise error checking.
VPL Retirement A VPL is released by setting atmVplRowStatus to destroy(6), and the agent may release all associated resources.
"The VPI value of the VPL.
Note that the VPI 0 is not used for a VPL not associated with a VCL.
The maximum VPI value cannot exceed the value allowable by the atmInterfaceMaxVpiBits."
"This object is implemented only for a VPL which terminates a VPC (i.e., one which is NOT cross connected to other VPLs).

{ atmMIBObjects 7} atmVclEntry    OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
An entry in the VCL table.
This entry is used to model a bi directional VCL.
To create a VCL at an ATM interface, either of the following procedures are used: Negotiated VCL establishment (1)
The management application creates a VCL entry in the atmVclTable by setting atmVclRowStatus to createAndWait(5).
This may fail for the following reasons: The selected VPI/VCI values are unavailable, The selected VPI/VCI values are in use.
Otherwise, the agent creates a row and reserves the VPI/VCI values on that port.
The manager selects an existing row(s) in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable, thereby, selecting a set of self consistent ATM traffic parameters and the QoS Class for receive and transmit directions of the VCL.
If no suitable row(s) in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable exists, the manager must create a new row(s) in that table.
The manager characterizes the VCL's traffic parameters through setting the atmVclReceiveTrafficDescrIndex and the atmVclTransmitTrafficDescrIndex values in the VCL table, which point to the rows containing desired ATM traffic parameter values in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable.
The agent will check the availability of resources and may refuse the request.
The manager activates the VCL by setting the the atmVclRowStatus to active(1).
If this set is successful, the agent has reserved the resources to satisfy the requested traffic parameter values and the QoS Class for that VCL.
If the VCL terminates a VCC in the ATM host or switch, the manager turns on the atmVclAdminStatus to up(1) to turn the VCL traffic flow on.
Otherwise, the atmVcCrossConnectTable  must be used to cross connect the VCL to another VCL(s) in an ATM switch or network.
One Shot VCL Establishment A VCL may also be established in one step by a set request with all necessary VCL parameter values and atmVclRowStatus set to createAndGo(4).
In contrast to the negotiated VCL establishment which allows for detailed error checking (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to particular resource acquisition failures), the one shot VCL establishment performs the setup on one operation but does not have the advantage of step wise error checking.
VCL Retirement A VCL is released by setting atmVclRowStatus to destroy(6), and the agent may release all associated resources.

current DESCRIPTION "The ATM VP Cross Connect table.
bi  directional VP cross connect which cross connects

An entry in the ATM VP Cross Connect table.
This entry is used to model a bi directional ATM VP cross connect which cross connects two VPLs.
Step wise Procedures to set up a VP Cross connect Once the entries in the atmVplTable are created, the following procedures are used to cross connect the VPLs together.
The manager obtains a unique atmVpCrossConnectIndex by reading the atmVpCrossConnectIndexNext object.
Next, the manager creates a set of one or more rows in the ATM VP Cross Connect Table, one for each cross connection between two VPLs.
Each row is indexed by the ATM interface port numbers and VPI values of the two ends of that cross connection.
This set of rows specifies the topology of the VPC cross connect and is identified by a single value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex.
Negotiated VP Cross Connect Establishment (2a)
The manager creates a row in this table by setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to createAndWait(5).
The agent checks the requested topology and the mutual sanity of the ATM traffic parameters and QoS Classes,
i.e., the row creation fails if: the requested topology is not supported by the agent, the traffic/QoS parameter values associated with the requested row are incompatible with those of already existing rows for this VP cross connect.
[For example, for setting up a point to point VP cross connect, the ATM traffic parameters in the receive direction of a VPL at the low end of the cross connect must equal to the traffic parameters in the transmit direction of the other VPL at the high end of the cross connect, otherwise, the row creation fails.]
The agent also checks for internal errors in building the cross connect.
The atmVpCrossConnectIndex values in the corresponding atmVplTable rows are filled in by the agent at this point.
The manager promotes the row in the atmVpCrossConnectTable by setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to active(1).
If this set is successful, the agent has reserved the resources specified by the ATM traffic parameter and QoS Class values for each direction of the VP cross connect in an ATM switch or network.
The manager sets the atmVpCrossConnectAdminStatus to up(1) in all rows of this VP cross connect to turn the traffic flow on.
One Shot VP Cross Connect Establishment A VP cross connect may also be established in one step by a set request with all necessary parameter values and atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus set to createAndGo(4).
In contrast to the negotiated VP cross connect establishment which allows for detailed error checking (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to particular resource acquisition failures), the one shot VP cross connect establishment performs the setup on one operation but does not have the advantage of step wise error checking.
VP Cross Connect Retirement A
VP cross connect identified by a particular value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex is released by:
(1) Setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus of all rows identified by this value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex to destroy(6).
The agent may release all associated resources, and the atmVpCrossConnectIndex values in the corresponding atmVplTable row are removed.
Note that a situation when only a subset of the associated rows are deleted corresponds to a VP topology change.
(2) After deletion of the appropriate atmVpCrossConnectEntries, the manager may set atmVplRowStatus to destroy(6) the associated VPLs.
The agent releases the resources and removes the associated rows in the atmVplTable.
VP Cross connect Reconfiguration At the discretion of the agent, a VP cross connect may be reconfigured by adding and/or deleting leafs to/from the VP topology as per the VP cross connect establishment/retirement procedures.
Reconfiguration of traffic/QoS parameter values requires release of the VP cross connect before those parameter values may by changed for individual VPLs.
