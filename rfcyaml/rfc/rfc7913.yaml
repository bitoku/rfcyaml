  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC7315] defines the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\
    \ [RFC3261]\n   P-Access-Network-Info header field.\n   The header field syntax\
    \ contains an 'access-info' header field\n   parameter, with a set of pre-defined\
    \ values.  Most pre-defined values\n   follow the 'generic-param' rule [RFC3261].\
    \  However, currently the\n   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] in [RFC7315]\
    \ requires new\n   values to follow the 'gen-value' rule [RFC3261], which is more\n\
    \   restrictive than 'generic-param'.  There is no justification for the\n   restriction,\
    \ and new values have already been defined following the\n   'generic-param' rule.\n\
    \   The ABNF also defines the following 'access-info' header field\n   parameter\
    \ values: 'operator-specific-GI' and 'utran-sai-3gpp'.\n   However, the values\
    \ are not included in the list of 'access-info'\n   values.\n   This document\
    \ updates Section 5.4 of [RFC7315], by modifying the\n   extension-access-info\
    \ part of the P-Access-Network-Info header field\n   ABNF.\n   As the P-Access-Network-Info\
    \ header field is mainly used in networks\n   defined by the 3rd-Generation Partnership\
    \ Project (3GPP), where new\n   values following the 'generic-param' rule have\
    \ been defined\n   [TS.3GPP.24.229], the update is not considered to cause issues\
    \ with\n   backward compatibility.\n"
