- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops\n\
    \   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the\n   Internet,\
    \ and to suggest future directions for the Internet\n   architecture.  This long-term\
    \ planning function of the IAB is\n   complementary to the ongoing engineering\
    \ efforts performed by working\n   groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force\
    \ (IETF).\n   The IAB convened the ESCAPE Workshop to examine some proposed changes\n\
    \   to the Internet and the Web, and their potential effects on the\n   Internet\
    \ publishing landscape.  Of particular interest was the Web\n   Packaging proposal\
    \ from Google, under consideration in the IETF, the\n   W3C's Web Incubator Community\
    \ Group (WICG), and the Web Hypertext\n   Application Technology Working Group\
    \ (WHATWG).\n   In considering these proposals, we heard about both positive effects\n\
    \   of Web Packaging and concerns that it could have significant effects\n   on\
    \ the relationship between publishers (e.g., news web sites) and\n   content aggregators\
    \ (e.g., search engines and social networks).  As\n   such, our focus was primarily\
    \ on this relationship, rather than\n   technical discussion.\n   Online publishers\
    \ do not regularly participate in standards\n   activities directly.  A workshop\
    \ format was used to solicit input\n   from them.  The workshop had 27 participants\
    \ from a diverse set of\n   backgrounds, including a small number of attendees\
    \ from publishers,\n   one aggregator (Google), plus representatives from browsers,\
    \ the\n   Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) community, Content Distribution\n   Networks\
    \ (CDNs), network operators, academia, and standards bodies.\n   See the workshop\
    \ call for papers [CFP] for more information and a\n   complete listing of submissions.\n\
    \   As intended, the workshop was primarily a forum for discussion, so it\n  \
    \ did not reach definite conclusions.  Instead, this report is the\n   primary\
    \ output of the workshop, as a record of that discussion.\n   This report documents\
    \ the use cases discussed in Section 2 and\n   explains the interactions between\
    \ publishers and aggregators that\n   might be affected by it in Section 3.  Appendix\
    \ A includes more\n   details about the workshop itself.  For those unfamiliar\
    \ with Web\n   Packaging, Appendix B provides a summary as background material.\n"

    \ Submissions\n   to the workshop were public and thus attributable; they are\
    \ used here\n   to provide substance and context.\n"
- title: 2.  Use Cases
  contents:
  - "2.  Use Cases\n   Much of the workshop concentrated on discussion of the validity\
    \ and\n   relative merits of the use cases that might be enabled by Web\n   Packaging.\
    \  See Appendix B for an overview of Web Packaging.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Instant Navigation
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Instant Navigation\n   The largest use of Web Packaging so far is in Google\
    \ Search, where\n   packages are intended to improve the perceived performance\
    \ of\n   navigation to pages that are linked from search results when\n   \"clicked\"\
    .\n   To enable this, when a linking (or referring) web page includes links\n\
    \   to pages on another site, it also provides the browser with a\n   packaged\
    \ copy of the target content, signed by the origin of the\n   target content.\
    \  In effect, the referring page provides a cache for\n   the target page's content.\
    \  If navigation to one of those links\n   occurs, having the Web Package gives\
    \ a browser the assurance that the\n   cache didn't change the content, so it\
    \ can treat that content as if\n   it were acquired directly from the server for\
    \ the target page -- even\n   though it came from a different server.  In many\
    \ cases, this results\n   in significantly lower perceived delay in displaying\
    \ the target page.\n   A vital characteristic of this technique is that the browser\
    \ does not\n   contact the target site before navigation.  The browser does not\
    \ make\n   any requests to sites until after navigation occurs, and only then\
    \ if\n   the site requires additional content or makes a request directly.\n \
    \  Similar improvements could also be realized by downloading content\n   (packaged\
    \ or otherwise) directly from the target site through a\n   technique called \"\
    prefetching\".  However, doing so would reveal\n   information about the user's\
    \ activity on the linking page to those\n   sites -- even when the user never\
    \ actually navigates to it.\n      |  Note: This technique that uses Web Packaging\
    \ is also referred\n      |  to as \"privacy-preserving prefetch\".  This document\
    \ avoids that\n      |  term as there was some contention at the workshop about\
    \ which\n      |  aspects of privacy might be preserved by the technique.\n  \
    \ Sites bundled with Web Packaging can additionally be constructed in a\n   way\
    \ that ensures that they render without needing any additional\n   network access.\
    \  This makes it possible to provide near-instantaneous\n   navigation.  The proposed\
    \ changes to web navigation in support of\n   loading Web Packages is designed\
    \ to support this use case.\n   Workshop participants recognized the value of\
    \ web performance for\n   usability, as well as for business metrics like retention\
    \ and bounce\n   rates.  Such improvements were seen as a valuable goal, but\n\
    \   publishers raised questions about whether they justified the cost of\n   supporting\
    \ an additional format, while others raised concerns about\n   different aspects\
    \ of the Web Packaging proposal.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Offline Content Sharing
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Offline Content Sharing\n   Another primary use case discussed was the\
    \ ability to share web\n   content between devices where neither has an active\
    \ connection to the\n   Internet.  One of the stated goals of Web Packaging is\
    \ to enable\n   sharing of content offline.\n   Several participants reported\
    \ that in areas where Internet access is\n   expensive, slow, or intermittent,\
    \ the use of direct peer-to-peer file\n   exchange (e.g., \"saving a website and\
    \ sharing it on a USB stick\") is\n   commonplace.  Most web browsers already\
    \ have some affordances for\n   this, but these are recognized as in need of improvements.\n\
    \   In the discussion, several rejected an assumed requirement of this\n   use\
    \ case -- that there be no difference between the treatment of a\n   \"normal\"\
    \ web page and that of one loaded from an offline Web Package.\n   The ability\
    \ for a Web Package to provide clear attribution for\n   content was seen as valuable\
    \ by some participants for a range of\n   reasons.  However, reservations were\
    \ expressed about the subtleties\n   of the properties that signatures provide\
    \ and the effect of this on\n   web security; see also Sections 4.2 and 2.3.2.\n\
    \   Many participants pointed out that using \"unsigned bundles\" -- that\n  \
    \ is, Web Packages without signed exchanges -- could be adequate for\n   this\
    \ use case, since most users don't need cryptographic proof of the\n   site's\
    \ identity.  However, some expressed concerns that this might\n   worsen the propagation\
    \ of falsehood.\n   Some suggested that the value of signed exchanges was not\
    \ realized in\n   small-scale interpersonal exchange of information but in the\
    \ building\n   of systems for content delivery that might include capabilities\
    \ like\n   discovery and automated distribution.  The contention here was that\n\
    \   effective use of digital signatures in offline distribution of\n   content\
    \ implied considerably more infrastructure than was described\n   in current proposals.\n\
    \   No definite conclusions about offline sharing were reached during the\n  \
    \ workshop.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Other Use Cases
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Other Use Cases\n   A session on the second morning concentrated on two\
    \ other significant\n   potential use cases for Web Packages: book publishing\
    \ and Web\n   archiving.  These were not seen as \"primary\" by the proponents\
    \ of Web\n   Packaging; the original intent was not to spend significant time\
    \ on\n   these subjects, but there was considerable interest from attendees.\n"
- title: 2.3.1.  Book Publishing
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Book Publishing\n   The potential application of a packaging format to\
    \ book publishing\n   was discussed, with particular reference to ways that books\
    \ differ\n   from web content.  Specialists from that industry pointed out that\n\
    \   book delivery can vary greatly from typical web content delivery.\n   Workshop\
    \ participants briefly explored existing solutions.  PDF was\n   seen as particularly\
    \ challenging for this use case, due to its\n   limitations, and EPUB has constraints\
    \ that also make it challenging\n   for publishers.\n   Although Web Packaging\
    \ might help to address this use case, the\n   question of how to identify book\
    \ content was not resolved.  The use\n   of signed exchanges in this context might\
    \ offer means of tying\n   content in books to a website, but several limitations\
    \ inherent in\n   doing that were identified.\n   In particular, book publication\
    \ specialists represented that books\n   don't have the same requirements for\
    \ timeliness or currency as web\n   pages.  For instance, Dave Cramer's submission\
    \ [CRAMER] observed that\n   Moby Dick was published over 61,000 days ago, which\
    \ is considerably\n   longer than the proposed limit of 7 days for signed exchanges.\
    \  The\n   limited length of time that a Web Package can be considered valid was\n\
    \   discussed at some length.\n   Additionally, the risk of a publisher going\
    \ out of business during\n   the lifetime of a book is significant, because books\
    \ -- at least\n   successful ones -- often span generations in their applicability.\
    \  To\n   that end, having a means of attributing content to a publisher was\n\
    \   considered less practical and potentially undesirable (much like the\n   discussion\
    \ above regarding \"unsigned bundles\").\n   There were other aspects of book\
    \ publication that participants saw as\n   challenging for packaging.  For example,\
    \ it is currently not\n   understood what it means to refer to distinct parts\
    \ of a book.\n   Participants saw this as an area where providing stable references\n\
    \   for bundles of content might offer possibilities, but nothing\n   concrete\
    \ came from that discussion.\n   The potential for active content in a bundle\
    \ to use web APIs to\n   enrich content or enable new features was considered\
    \ valuable.\n   Models for enabling paywalls were discussed at some length (see\n\
    \   Section 5.4).\n"
- title: 2.3.2.  Web Archiving
  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Web Archiving\n   Web archiving is a complicated discipline that is made\
    \ more difficult\n   by the complex nature of the Web itself.\n   From an archival\
    \ standpoint, the potential for web content to be\n   provided in a self-contained\
    \ form was viewed positively.  Several\n   improvements to the structure of Web\
    \ Packaging were considered, such\n   as providing complete sets of content and\
    \ the use of Memento\n   [MEMENTO].\n   Though there were potential applications\
    \ of a packaging scheme, many\n   challenges were recognized as requiring additional\
    \ work on the part\n   of content producers to be fully effective.  For example,\
    \ JavaScript\n   is needed to render some archived content faithfully, but attributing\n\
    \   that content to an origin in all scenarios is challenging.\n   If packaging\
    \ were to be widely deployed, it might improve the\n   situation for archival\
    \ replay.  In particular, the speculation is\n   that there would be less \"live\
    \ leakage\" as packaged content might be\n   less likely to refer to live resources\
    \ that currently tend to \"leak\"\n   into views of archives.  It was also noted\
    \ that subresources might\n   also be more likely to be packaged, especially those\
    \ that are needed\n   for deferred representations (i.e., after JavaScript execution\
    \ on the\n   page or some user interactions).  Other potential applications and\n\
    \   enhancements are discussed in [ALAM].\n   Participants discussed the use of\
    \ a signature for non-repudiation at\n   some length.  In one case related to\
    \ the Internet Archive, a public\n   figure disputed the accuracy of archived\
    \ content, asserting that the\n   original content was modified either at the\
    \ source or in the archive.\n   Some participants initially saw digital signatures\
    \ as a way to\n   address such issues of provenance.  As similar problems exist\
    \ in\n   other areas, such as in book publication, medical research, and news,\n\
    \   a solution to this problem was considered to have broad\n   applicability.\n\
    \   However, the discussion ultimately concluded that providing non-\n   repudiation\
    \ in retrospect is challenging.  Signing keys are not\n   expected to remain secure\
    \ for long periods.  If keys are leaked\n   afterwards, an attacker could retroactively\
    \ generate fraudulent\n   signatures.  Alternative solutions were discussed, such\
    \ as providing\n   independent archives for the same data, using consensus protocols,\
    \ or\n   using an append-only construct like a Haber-Stornetta log [AOLOG],\n\
    \   all of which can be used to increase the difficulty of altering or\n   misrepresenting\
    \ established archives.\n"
- title: 3.  Interactions between Web Publishers and Aggregators
  contents:
  - "3.  Interactions between Web Publishers and Aggregators\n   A significant motivation\
    \ for holding the workshop was to provide a\n   forum where publishers could discuss\
    \ the impact of Web Packaging on\n   the online publishing ecosystem.  Of primary\
    \ interest was whether Web\n   Packages might effectively enable a transfer of\
    \ power from publishers\n   to aggregators.\n   Both publishers and aggregators\
    \ at the workshop expressed the\n   importance of maintaining a positive relationship.\
    \  Publishers in\n   particular expressed the need to be able to trust that aggregators\n\
    \   won't misrepresent their work or de-emphasize it for reasons\n   unrelated\
    \ to quality and perceived value to the user.\n   One key question from [BERJON]\
    \ was discussed:\n   |  Web Packaging has other uses, but it is primarily seen\
    \ by a large\n   |  proportion of its stakeholders as a solution to problems that\
    \ AMP\n   |  created.  Before we agree to solve those issues, should we not ask\n\
    \   |  if AMP was a useful approach in the first place -- and useful to\n   |\
    \  whom?\n   In examining this issue, discussion focused on the current incentive\n\
    \   model offered by aggregators.  The costs that publishers incur for\n   participation\
    \ in that system were considered.  Considerable time was\n   spent on AMP; a summary\
    \ of that discussion can be found in Section 5.\n   We also considered the question\
    \ of whether standardizing Web\n   Packaging confers credibility to aggregators\
    \ exercising unwelcome\n   control over publisher content or whether the technical\
    \ safeguards\n   Web Packaging provides could allow aggregators to relax their\n\
    \   restrictions on the kinds of content they're willing to cache and\n   serve.\
    \  No conclusions were drawn.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Incentives for Web Packages
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Incentives for Web Packages\n   Submissions to the workshop indicated that\
    \ the use of inducements\n   involving better placement and formatting of links\
    \ to publisher\n   content had a significant effect on the uptake of related technology.\n\
    \   For example, in [DEPUYDT-NELSON]:\n   |  [...] The Washington Post has always\
    \ placed a great deal of trust\n   |  in Google to represent its content--and\
    \ their reward for doing so\n   |  is more traffic, which positively impacts the\
    \ business.\n   During the workshop, several online publishers indicated that\
    \ if it\n   weren't for the privileged position in the Google Search carousel\n\
    \   given to AMP content, they would not publish in that format.\n   Publishers\
    \ that do produce AMP said they see a non-trivial increase\n   in traffic as a\
    \ result of deploying AMP content.  For example, Yahoo\n   Japan reported a 60%\
    \ increase in traffic as a result of deploying AMP\n   on Yahoo Travel [OTSU].\
    \  There was no data presented as to whether\n   this increase was due to better\
    \ placement in Google Search results,\n   the inherent benefits of the AMP Cache,\
    \ or the use of the AMP format.\n   Anecdotal evidence was offered by another\
    \ large publisher that saw a\n   10% drop in traffic as a result of accidentally\
    \ disabling AMP\n   content.  However, increases in traffic might not result in\
    \ similarly\n   proportioned increases in revenue, as observed in [BREWSTER].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Operational Costs
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Operational Costs\n   Several participants pointed out that introducing\
    \ a new, parallel\n   format for Web content incurs operational costs.  In particular,\n\
    \   supporting any new format -- such as Web Packaging, Apple News, or\n   Facebook\
    \ Instant Articles -- requires not only initial development of\n   tooling (some\
    \ generic and some specific to a site's requirements) but\n   also an ongoing\
    \ investment in maintaining its operability.  Some\n   participants expressed\
    \ concern about the impact upon small publishers\n   with limited technical and\
    \ financial resources, especially in the\n   current publishing climate.\n   Increased\
    \ exposure from new formats might not always justify the\n   added expense of\
    \ providing articles in that format [BREWSTER].\n   However, a standardized format\
    \ might help publishers reduce the cost\n   of maintaining multiple formats.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Content Regulation
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Content Regulation\n   The use of Web Packaging as a tool for avoiding\
    \ censorship was not a\n   significant topic of discussion, except to note that\
    \ publishers often\n   have regulatory requirements regarding removal or correction\
    \ of\n   content.\n   Reference was made to the desire to remove videos of a recent\n\
    \   shooting [CHRISTCHURCH] and the potential difficulty in doing so if\n   content\
    \ were available as Web Packages.  Legal requirements to remove\n   content come\
    \ from multiple angles: copyright violations, illegal\n   content, editorial corrections\
    \ or errors, and right to erasure\n   provisions in the European Union General\
    \ Data Protection Regulation\n   [GDPR] were mentioned.  One participant speculated\
    \ that making it\n   more difficult to remove material in this way might discourage\n\
    \   regulators from censoring content.\n   In this context, participants observed\
    \ that it would be difficult to\n   create mechanisms to track and control content\
    \ served as a Web\n   Package without compromising the stated goal of censorship\n\
    \   resistance.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Web Performance
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Web Performance\n   Understanding the effect that Web Packaging might have\
    \ on web\n   performance was a matter of some contention.\n   Some informal analysis\
    \ from the Google Search deployment was\n   presented (later published in [AMP-PERF])\
    \ that showed significant\n   performance improvements in metrics related to navigation\
    \ time\n   resulting from the combination of prefetch, prerendering, and the AMP\n\
    \   format.  These results are suggestive of a possibility that Web\n   Packaging\
    \ could provide some of that improvement on its own, but no\n   data was presented\
    \ that apportioned the improvement among the three\n   components.\n   Though\
    \ data was presented to demonstrate potential rather than be a\n   definitive\
    \ result, discussions raised a number of questions that\n   suggest the need for\
    \ further study.  Attendees suggested that future\n   measurements consider the\
    \ effect of signed bundles distinct from the\n   enhancements derived from the\
    \ AMP format.  Future research in this\n   area might also consider the effectiveness\
    \ of different strategies on\n   devices with varying capabilities, bandwidth,\
    \ power consumption\n   requirements, or network conditions.\n   Of particular\
    \ interest is the additional work required to fetch and\n   render multiple web\
    \ pages in preparation for navigation.  This might\n   ultimately use fewer connections\
    \ but comes with an increased network\n   and CPU cost for clients.  Some participants\
    \ pointed out that\n   different clients or applications might require different\
    \ tuning --\n   for example, when users have limited (or expensive) bandwidth\
    \ or for\n   sites with less clear knowledge about the use of outbound links.\n\
    \   Workshop participants also expressed interest in learning about the\n   effect\
    \ of Web Packages on subsequent navigations within the target\n   site.\n   In\
    \ discussion, some participants suggested that their experience\n   supported\

  - "4.  Systemic Effects\n   It is not straightforward to estimate how a proposed\
    \ technology\n   change might affect all of the parts of a system -- including\
    \ not\n   only other components, but also things like end-user rights and the\n\
    \   balance of power between parties -- ahead of time.  To date, when\n   evaluating\
    \ proposals, the IETF has generally focused on more\n   immediate concerns, such\
    \ as interoperability and security.\n   Moreover, people often find new uses for\
    \ successful standards\n   [SUCCESS] after they are deployed.  It is rarely possible\
    \ to\n   accurately predict all applications of a protocol or format, whether\n\
    \   they are harmful or beneficial.  Refusing standardization only\n   impedes\
    \ both outcomes.\n   With the understanding that predictions are difficult to\
    \ make, there\n   was considerable speculation at the workshop about the possible\n\
    \   effect of Web Packaging on the Web. Some of that speculation is\n   informed\
    \ by experience, but that experience is necessarily limited in\n   scope.  This\
    \ section attempts to capture that discussion.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Consolidation
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Consolidation\n   Concerns about the consolidation of power on the Internet\
    \ have\n   significantly increased lately, as a result of several factors.\n \
    \  While the IAB, the Internet Society, and others are examining this\n   phenomenon\
    \ to understand it better, it is nevertheless prudent to\n   consider whether\
    \ proposals for changes to how the Internet works\n   favors or counters consolidation.\
    \  Favoring entities with existing\n   advantages -- like resources, size, or\
    \ market share -- is not\n   necessarily a factor that disqualifies a new proposal,\
    \ but it needs\n   to be considered as a cost of enabling that technology.\n \
    \  Although the outcomes of adopting Web Packaging are unclear, the\n   workshop\
    \ revealed several concerns for consolidation risks for all\n   involved parties:\
    \ users, publisher sites, linking sites, and services\n   they each rely on.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  Consolidation of Power in Linking Sites
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Consolidation of Power in Linking Sites\n   Several participants noted\
    \ that Web Packaging's enabling of instant\n   navigation (Section 2.1) might\
    \ advantage larger linking sites -- such\n   as social networks or search engines\
    \ -- over smaller ones in the same\n   industry because doing so requires careful\
    \ selections of which links\n   to optimize, so as not to create unneeded traffic.\n\
    \   For example, a news article often has many links, but not all of them\n  \
    \ are equally likely to be followed.  Deciding which ones to prefetch\n   requires\
    \ considerable data collection and engineering, so this\n   technique might not\
    \ be feasible for smaller entities.  Additionally,\n   some participants noted\
    \ that this technique favors sites that have a\n   linear set of ranked links,\
    \ like search results; it is more difficult\n   to apply to a page of news (for\
    \ example) because predicting what link\n   a user will follow is less obvious.\n\
    \   This technique also requires access to a cache with terms of use\n   compatible\
    \ with the requirements of the site.  It was pointed out\n   that the Google AMP\
    \ Cache has policies that might be acceptable to\n   many, and there are other\
    \ caches.  Sites operated by entities other\n   than Google already use this cache,\
    \ though it was observed that a\n   site that does not host its own cache suffers\
    \ a minor performance\n   degradation.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Consolidation of Power in Publishers
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Consolidation of Power in Publishers\n   Participants seemed to agree\
    \ that if performance is a strong enough\n   differentiator, the effective use\
    \ of Web Packaging might turn out to\n   be a condition for success for online\
    \ publishers.  Google Search's\n   choice to privilege content that is served\
    \ using HTTPS was pointed\n   out as showing that this sort of influence can be\
    \ effective.\n   Equally, it is not necessarily the case that standardization\
    \ of new\n   capabilities will affect such policies materially, as noted in\n\
    \   [YASSKIN]:\n   |  It seems unlikely that any decisions we make in a packaging\
    \ or\n   |  distribution system will affect the considerations aggregators use\n\
    \   |  when deciding how to rank recommendations or the power this gives\n   |\
    \  them over publishers.\n   The most common concern raised in the discussion\
    \ was the effect of\n   this technology on smaller publishers who might be less\
    \ able to\n   optimize the packages they produce, where their primary\n   differentiation\
    \ in the market has previously been the quality of\n   their content.\n"
- title: 4.1.3.  Consolidation of User Preferences
  contents:
  - "4.1.3.  Consolidation of User Preferences\n   In typical operation of the Web,\
    \ servers have an opportunity to\n   tailor content to the needs of their users.\
    \  In contrast, a static\n   Web Package has few options for individualization,\
    \ as the content is\n   generated once and used by many.\n   As a result, publishers\
    \ noted that AMP provides less opportunity to\n   customize content for their\
    \ customers.  Their concerns included not\n   only personalizing content based\
    \ on what they know about the user but\n   also optimizing the package for specific\
    \ browsers.  Other\n   participants observed in relation to this that Web Packaging\
    \ might\n   also have a consolidating effect in the browser market.\n   Some participants\
    \ brought up the possibility of customization by\n   providing multiple packages,\
    \ including multiple variants of resources\n   in a single package, or performing\
    \ customization after the package\n   was loaded.  However, other participants\
    \ pointed out that all of\n   these options have negative side effects, either\
    \ in complexity or\n   reduced performance arising from larger bundles or delayed\n\
    \   customization.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Effect on Web Security
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Effect on Web Security\n   One session explored the impact of introducing\
    \ a new security model\n   for the Web. Currently, sites rely on connection-oriented\
    \ security\n   (provided by TLS [TLS]), but Web Packaging adds a limited form\
    \ of\n   object security.  That is, the package protects the integrity of a\n\
    \   message, rather than providing integrity and confidentiality for its\n   delivery.\
    \  Object security is not a new concept in the context of the\n   Web; designs\
    \ like SHTTP [SHTTP] are as old as HTTPS.  Though the\n   intent is for Web Packaging\
    \ to have a far more narrow applicability,\n   it provides fewer security guarantees\
    \ than HTTPS, since it provides\n   only authentication, no confidentiality with\
    \ respect to the cache,\n   and no assurance of liveness.\n   Object-based security\
    \ -- such as proposed in Web Packaging -- allows\n   the use of content regardless\
    \ of how it is obtained; some\n   participants noted that third parties gain greater\
    \ control over the\n   distribution of content, reducing the ability of publishers\
    \ to\n   retract or alter content over the validity period of signed content.\n\
    \   Another topic of discussion was composition attacks.  In its proposed\n  \
    \ form, Web Packaging only provides authentication of independent\n   resources,\
    \ not a web page as a single unit, allowing an attacker to\n   control the composition\
    \ of resources.  This weakness was acknowledged\n   as a known shortcoming of\
    \ the current proposal that would be\n   addressed.\n   The issue of managing\
    \ the trade-off between control and performance\n   in caches arose.  While participants\
    \ recognized that problems with\n   resource composition already occur by accident\
    \ -- for example, when a\n   cache stores different versions of resources -- Web\
    \ Packaging allows\n   an attacker more direct control over what resources are\
    \ available to\n   clients.\n   For example, an attacker might be able to cause\
    \ content with a\n   security flaw to be used up to a week past the time that\
    \ the defect\n   was fixed.\n   As an example of how Web Packaging might change\
    \ the risk profile for\n   sites, participants discussed recovery from cross-site\
    \ scripting\n   attacks.  It is already the case that a brief exposure to this\
    \ class\n   of attack can result in an attacker gaining persistent access, but\n\
    \   mechanisms exist that can be used to avoid or correct issues, like\n   cache\
    \ validation and Clear Site Data [CLEAR-DATA].  These measures\n   are not available\
    \ to clients unless they connect to the site.\n   The discussion pointed out that\
    \ these concerns are not new or\n   uniquely enabled by Web Packaging.  However,\
    \ it was pointed out that\n   new features are routinely subject to higher security\
    \ and privacy\n   expectations.  In an example unrelated to Web Packaging but\
    \ with\n   similar trade-offs, shared compression of multiple resources has\n\
    \   significant performance benefits.  The risk with shared compression\n   is\
    \ the potential for exposing encrypted information through side\n   channels.\
    \  Though sites can use shared compression without this\n   exposure, shared compression\
    \ will likely only be enabled once it is\n   clear that measures to prevent accidental\
    \ information exposure are\n   understood to be effective in a broad set of deployments.\n\
    \   The discussion also addressed the question of whether concerns might\n   equally\
    \ apply to the typical use of a CDN as a third-party provider\n   of the content.\
    \  Some participants concluded that CDNs are typically\n   in a contractual relationship\
    \ with the sites they serve and so are\n   more likely to have their interests\
    \ aligned.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Privacy of Content
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Privacy of Content\n   Discussion and submissions raised concerns regarding\
    \ how serving\n   content using Web Packages might adversely affect privacy of\n\
    \   individuals.  There are challenges here, but the very narrow\n   applicability\
    \ of Web Packaging to what is effectively static content\n   limits the privacy\
    \ risk.  The conclusion was that, provided\n   sufficient care is taken in implementation,\
    \ the use of Web Packages\n   does not substantially increase the information\
    \ that an aggregator\n   gains about what content is consumed.\n   Concretely,\
    \ an aggregator knows what content it serves in\n   anticipation of navigation.\
    \  This is -- at least in theory --\n   substantially the same as the content\
    \ that the aggregator might\n   receive if it performed the navigation itself.\
    \  Assuming that content\n   is stripped of personalization, the aggregator gains\
    \ no new\n   information.\n"
- title: 5.  AMP Issues Unrelated to Web Packaging
  contents:
  - "5.  AMP Issues Unrelated to Web Packaging\n   On multiple occasions, discussion\
    \ at the workshop concentrated on\n   problems that arise as a result of constraints\
    \ on the AMP format or\n   details of its inclusion in Google Search.  For instance,\
    \ the\n   requirement to make pages expose their metadata is unlikely to be\n\
    \   affected by any standardization of a packaging format as that\n   requirement\
    \ is independent of the process of delivering content.\n   This section provides\
    \ some detail on aspects of the discussion that\n   touched on AMP more generally\
    \ in this way.  Some treatment of these\n   points is considered relevant as some\
    \ of the discussion at the\n   workshop, even under the remit of discussing Web\
    \ Packaging,\n   concentrated on the effect of AMP on the ecosystem.\n      |\
    \  Note: Of the four formats mentioned in the workshop call for\n      |  papers\
    \ [CFP], only AMP sent representatives to the workshop.\n      |  The discussion\
    \ was therefore concentrated around AMP; this\n      |  section should not be\
    \ read to imply anything about other\n      |  formats.\n   Discussion and submissions\
    \ referred to a commitment [AMP-LESSONS] to\n   allow publishers to use content\
    \ that met specific criteria to access\n   privileged positions in search results,\
    \ regardless of their adoption\n   of AMP.  Participants felt that this approach\
    \ might address some of\n   these concerns if it were adopted and durable.  For\
    \ instance, the use\n   of Web Packaging might be sufficient to remove some constraints\
    \ on\n   active content on the basis that the active content would be\n   attributed\
    \ to the publisher and not the AMP Cache.\n"
- title: 5.1.  AMP Governance
  contents:
  - "5.1.  AMP Governance\n   There was interest from workshop participants in the\
    \ governance model\n   used for AMP.  In particular, the question of how independent\
    \ the AMP\n   project would be of Google and Google Search arose.\n   Three of\
    \ the seven members of the AMP Technical Steering Committee,\n   the body that\
    \ governs AMP, are Google employees, which gives Google\n   considerable influence\
    \ over the project.  It was asserted that the\n   governance structure was intended\
    \ to be more independent of Google\n   over time.  The understanding was that\
    \ any consumer of the format,\n   such as Google Search, would make an independent\
    \ assessment about\n   whether to use or require different aspects of the AMP\
    \ project\n   products.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Constraints on the AMP Format
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Constraints on the AMP Format\n   Sites often implement AMP by creating\
    \ a separate set of content in\n   parallel to their regular HTML content.  Publishers\
    \ noted this as a\n   high cost, particularly for smaller sites.  It was pointed\
    \ out that\n   websites can serve AMP-compliant content exclusively.  However,\n\
    \   several publishers referred to limitations in the format that made it\n  \
    \ unsuitable for their needs.\n   Many cited reasons for this duplication were\
    \ related to the necessity\n   of running arbitrary active content (typically,\
    \ JavaScript).  For\n   example:\n   *  AMP provides a framework for supporting\
    \ user authentication, but\n      publishers asserted that using this framework\
    \ was not considered\n      practical.\n   *  AMP content does not support rendering\
    \ of certain content, which\n      can affect the ability of publishers to innovate\
    \ content\n      production.\n   *  The AMP model for the implementation of paywalls\
    \ (Section 5.4) was\n      claimed to be inimical to some publisher business models.\n\
    \   More broadly, they considered AMP's constraints on the use of active\n   content\
    \ as problematic, since they prevent the use of capabilities\n   that are provided\
    \ on equivalent non-AMP pages.  Reference was made to\n   a proposed <amp-script>\
    \ element -- which has since been made fully\n   available -- that seeks to provide\
    \ limited access to some dynamic\n   content.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Performance
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Performance\n   Publishers observed that using the AMP format does not\
    \ provide any\n   guarantee of performance gains and, in some cases, could contribute\n\
    \   to performance degradation.  It was suggested that this was most\n   problematic\
    \ for sites that are already well-tuned for performance.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Implementation of Paywalls
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Implementation of Paywalls\n   The use of paywalls by web publishers to\
    \ control access to content in\n   return for payment is increasingly common.\
    \  One popular approach is\n   to offer a limited number of articles without payment\
    \ while insisting\n   on a paid subscription to access further articles.\n   On\
    \ several occasions, participants expressed dissatisfaction with the\n   difficulty\
    \ of integrating paywall authorization when using AMP.  In\n   particular, they\
    \ said AMP encourages publishers to include an\n   article's full content, hidden\
    \ by default but easily accessible to\n   motivated users.  The discussion extended\
    \ to workarounds like cookie\n   syncing [COOKIE-SYNC], which is used as part\
    \ of authorization and is\n   a consequence of having cached content hosted on\
    \ the linking site\n   rather than the target site.\n   The same topic came up\
    \ concerning book publication, where publishers\n   indicated that having a means\
    \ of enabling different methods of\n   distribution without also facilitating\
    \ unconstrained copying of book\n   content was necessary.\n   This conflation\
    \ of AMP issues with those addressed by Web Packaging\n   was recurrent in the\
    \ discussion.  As observed in [DAS], these\n   concerns might be addressed by\
    \ linking to a signed bundle.\n"

- title: Appendix B.  Web Packaging Overview
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Web Packaging Overview\n   Web Packaging is comprised of two separate\
    \ technologies: resource\n   bundling [BUNDLE] and signed exchanges [SXG].\n \
    \  In both the submissions and workshop discussion, the most\n   controversial\
    \ aspect of the technology is the use of signed exchanges\n   as an alternative\
    \ means of providing authority over a particular\n   resource, for a few different\
    \ reasons.\n   This appendix explains how authority works on the Web and how Web\n\
    \   Packaging proposes to change that.\n"
- title: B.1.  Authority in HTTPS
  contents:
  - "B.1.  Authority in HTTPS\n   The Web currently uses HTTPS [HTTP] to establish\
    \ a server's authority\n   -- that is, to give an assurance that the content came\
    \ from where the\n   URL implies.  The combination of URI scheme (https), domain\
    \ name (or\n   host), and port number are formed into a single identifier, the\n\
    \   origin [ORIGIN] to which content is attributed.\n   Web browsers use the certificate\
    \ offered as part of a TLS connection\n   [TLS] to servers in determining whether\
    \ a server is authoritative for\n   that origin; see [ORIGIN] and Section 9.1\
    \ of [HTTP].  Content is\n   attributed to a given URL only if it is received\
    \ from a connection to\n   a server that is authoritative for the associated origin.\n\
    \   As an example, a web browser seeking to load \"https://example.com/\n   index.html\"\
    \ makes a TLS connection to a server.  As part of the TLS\n   connection establishment,\
    \ the server offers a certificate for the\n   name \"example.com\".  If the browser\
    \ accepts the certificate, it will\n   then make requests for URLs on the \"https://example.com\"\
    \ origin on\n   that connection and consider any answers from the server to be\n\
    \   authoritative.\n   This notion of authority is a crucial property of web security:\
    \ only\n   content that is attributed to the same web origin can access all\n\
    \   information in that origin, including the content of most resources\n   as\
    \ well as state associated with the origin, such as cookies.  This\n   separation\
    \ ensures that sites can keep secrets from each other, even\n   when they are\
    \ both loaded in the same browser.\n"
- title: B.2.  Authority in Web Packaging
  contents:
  - "B.2.  Authority in Web Packaging\n   Web Packaging, through the use of signed\
    \ exchanges, aims to provide\n   an alternative means of establishing authority.\
    \  A signed exchange is\n   an expression of an HTTP request and response (an\
    \ exchange) with\n   certain information stripped and a digital signature applied.\n\
    \   The signature is made with a similar certificate to the one a server\n   might\
    \ offer in HTTPS -- that certificate can also be used for HTTPS\n   -- but it\
    \ includes a special attribute that denotes its suitability\n   for signed exchanges.\n\
    \   A web browser that has been provided with a signed exchange can\n   verify\
    \ the signature and, if the signature is valid and the\n   certificate is acceptable,\
    \ use the content from the signed exchange.\n   Critically, the web browser does\
    \ not make an HTTPS connection to a\n   server to get the content or to verify\
    \ the signature.\n   In effect, Web Packaging moves from a model where authority\
    \ is\n   derived from the delivery method (i.e., TLS) to an object security\n\
    \   model, where authority is derived from a signature on objects.  In\n   doing\
    \ so, it aims to render the means of delivery irrelevant to\n   determinations\
    \ of security.\n"
- title: B.3.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "B.3.  Applicability\n   Web Packaging does not claim to supplant the authority\
    \ model of the\n   Web completely, but it does provide an alternative that might\
    \ be used\n   under certain narrow conditions.  In particular, Web Packaging is\n\
    \   intended for use with content that is not secret from an entity that\n   is\
    \ aware of the existence of that content.\n   In aid of this goal, Web Packaging\
    \ does not include information from\n   exchanges that is related to the process\
    \ of acquiring content nor\n   does it include any information that is related\
    \ to individual\n   requests.  For instance, use of the Set-Cookie header field\
    \ is\n   expressly forbidden, as it often contains information that is related\n\
    \   to a particular user.\n"
- title: B.4.  The AMP Format, Google Search Results, and Web Packaging
  contents:
  - "B.4.  The AMP Format, Google Search Results, and Web Packaging\n   The relationship\
    \ between the AMP Project <https://amp.dev/> and Web\n   Packaging is complicated.\
    \  The AMP Project, sponsored by Google,\n   establishes a profile of HTML with\
    \ a stated goal of providing support\n   for the best practices for the format,\
    \ with a strong emphasis on\n   performance.  The format tightly constrains the\
    \ use of HTML features\n   but also offers a library of components that provide\
    \ sanitized\n   implementations of many commonly used capabilities.\n   The connection\
    \ to Web Packaging is bound up in the way that Google\n   Search treats AMP content\
    \ specially.  AMP content provides two\n   properties that Google Search exploits:\
    \ metadata exposure and static\n   analysis of active content.\n   AMP content\
    \ provides metadata in a form that can be reliably\n   extracted, using the microformats\
    \ defined by the Schema.org project\n   <https://schema.org/>.  This aspect of\
    \ AMP has no effect on the\n   discussion, except to the extent that this relates\
    \ to Google Search\n   and their use of this metadata in populating the carousel.\n\
    \   Constrained use of active content -- such as JavaScript -- in AMP\n   makes\
    \ it possible to analyze content to verify that actions taken are\n   narrowly\
    \ limited.  This static analysis assures that AMP content can\n   be served without\
    \ affecting other content on the same site.  For\n   Google Search, this is what\
    \ enables the loading of AMP content\n   alongside search content and other AMP\
    \ resources.\n   To provide preloading, Google operates the Google AMP Cache\n\
    \   <https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/>, from which AMP content is\n  \
    \ served.  As a consequence, browsers attribute the content to the\n   origin\
    \ [ORIGIN] of the AMP Cache and not the publisher, creating some\n   confusion\
    \ about how content is attributed, as discussed in the W3C\n   finding on distributed\
    \ content [TAG-DC].\n   An important goal of Web Packaging is to attribute content\
    \ loaded\n   from a cache, such as the Google AMP Cache, to the publisher that\n\
    \   created that content.  For more on this, see Section 2.1.\n"
