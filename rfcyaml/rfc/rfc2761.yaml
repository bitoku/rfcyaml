- title: Introduction

  - "Introduction\n   This document provides terminology for benchmarking ATM based\n\
    \   switching devices. It extends terminology already defined for\n   benchmarking\
    \ network interconnect devices in RFCs 1242, 2285, and\n   2544. Although some\
    \ of the definitions in this memo may be applicable\n   to a broader group of\
    \ network interconnect devices, the primary focus\n   of the terminology in this\
    \ memo is on ATM cell relay and signaling.\n   This memo contains two major sections:\
    \ Background and Definitions.\n   Within the definitions section is a formal definitions\
    \ subsection,\n   provided as a courtesy to the reader, and a measurement definitions\n\
    \   sub-section, that contains performance metrics with inherent units.\n   The\
    \ divisions of the measurement sub-section follow the BISDN model.\n   The BISDN\
    \ model comprises four layers and two planes. This document\n   addresses the\
    \ interactions between these layers and how they effect\n   IP and TCP throughput.\
    \ A schematic of the B-ISDN model follows:\n   ---------|--------------------------|-------------------------------\n\
    \            |     User Plane           |       Control Plane\n   ---------|--------------------------|--------------------------------\n\

    \   This document assumes that necessary services are available and\n   active.\
    \  For example, IP connectivity requires SSCOP connectivity\n   between signaling\
    \ entities.  Further, it is assumed that the SUT has\n   the ability to configure\
    \ ATM addresses (via hard coded addresses,\n   ILMI or PNNI neighbor discovery),\
    \ has the ability to run SSCOP, and\n   has the ability to perform signaled call\
    \ setups (via UNI or PNNI\n   signaling).  This document covers only CBR, VBR\
    \ and UBR traffic\n   types.  ABR will be handled in a separate document.  Finally,\
    \ this\n   document presents only the terminology associated with benchmarking\n\
    \   IP performance over ATM; therefore, it does not represent a total\n   compilation\
    \ of ATM test terminology.\n   The BMWG produces two major classes of documents:\
    \ Benchmarking\n   Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents.\
    \ The\n   Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related terms.\n\
    \   The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect\n   the\
    \ benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.\n"
- title: Existing Definitions
  contents:
  - "Existing Definitions\n   RFC 1242, \"Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect\
    \ Devices\"\n   should be consulted before attempting to make use of this document.\n\
    \   RFC 2544, \"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices\"\n\
    \   contains discussions of a number of terms relevant to the\n   benchmarking\
    \ of switching devices and should be consulted.  RFC 2285,\n   \"Benchmarking\
    \ Terminology for LAN Switching Devices\" contains a\n   number of terms pertaining\
    \ to traffic distributions and datagram\n   interarrival.  For the sake of clarity\
    \ and continuity, this RFC\n   adopts the template for definitions set out in\
    \ Section 2 of RFC 1242.\n   Definitions are indexed and grouped together in sections\
    \ for ease of\n   reference.  The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\

    \ is the 2 octet length of the higher layer PDU.\n   CRC-32 is a 32 bit (4 octet)\

    \ adaptation layer for UNI signaling, ILMI,\n   PNNI signaling, and for IP PDUs.\
    \ It is the most widely used AAL type\n   to date.  AAL5 requires two distinct\
    \ processes.  The first is the\n   encapsulation, on the transmit side, and de-encapsulation,\
    \ on the\n   receive side, of the higher layer PDU into the AAL5 CPCS PDU which\n\
    \   requires the computation of the length and the CRC-32.  The time\n   required\
    \ for this process depends on whether the CRC-32 computation\n   is done on the\
    \ interface (on-board) or in machine central memory (in\n   core).  On-board computation\
    \ should produce only a small, constant\n   delay; however, in core computation\
    \ will produce variable delay,\n   which will negatively effect TCP RTT computations.\
    \ The second process\n   is segmentation and re-assembly (SAR) which is defined\

    \ this\n   measurement is not included in this document, it should be noted that\n\
    \   the manner in which SAR is performed will greatly effect performance.\n  \
    \ SAR can be performed either on the interface card (on board) or in\n   machine\
    \ central memory (in core).  On-board computation should\n   produce only a small,\
    \ constant delay; however, in core computation\n   will produce variable delay,\
    \ which will negatively effect TCP RTT\n   computations.  This situation is further\
    \ complicated by the location\n   of the CRC-32 calculation.  Given an in core\
    \ CRC-32 calculation, bus\n   contention may cause on board SAR to be slower than\
    \ in core SAR.\n   Clearly, on board CRC-32 calculation and SAR will produce the\
    \ most\n   favorable performance results.\n   SAR performance will also be effected\
    \ by ATM layer impairments.  Cell\n   error (CE), cell loss(CL), cell mis-insertion\
    \ (CM) and cell delay\n   variation (CDV) will all negatively effect SAR.  CE\
    \ will cause an\n   AAL5 PDU to fail the CRC-32 check and be discarded, thus discarding\n\
    \   the packet which the PDU contained.  CL and CM will both cause an\n   AAL5\
    \ PDU to fail the length check and be discarded.  CL can have\n   other effects\
    \ depending on whether the cell which was lost is the\n   final cell (PTI=1) of\
    \ the AAL5 PDU.  The following discussion\n   enumerates the possibilities.\n\
    \   1. PTI=0 cell is lost.  In this case, re-assembly registers a length\n   discrepancy\
    \ and discards the PDU.\n   2. PTI=1 cell is lost.\n   2.  A.  The AAL5 re-assembly\

    \ timeout and one packet is\n   lost.\n   2.  B.  The first cell of the next AAL5\
    \ PDU arrives before the re-\n   assembly timer expires.  The AAL5 with the missing\
    \ PTI=1 cell is\n   prepended to the next AAL5 PDU in the SAR engine.  This yields\
    \ two\n   possibilities:\n   2. B. i. The AAL5 re-assembly timer expires before\
    \ the last cell,\n   PTI=1, of the next AAL5 PDU arrives.  The AAL5 PDU with the\
