Abstract This document describes new Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) groups for use in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Internet Key Exchange version 2
(IKEv2) protocols in addition to previously defined groups.
Specifically, the new curve groups are based on modular arithmetic rather than binary arithmetic.
These new groups are defined to align IKE and IKEv2 with other ECC implementations and standards, particularly NIST standards.
In addition, the curves defined here can provide more efficient implementation than previously defined ECC groups.
This document describes default Diffie Hellman groups for use in IKE and IKEv2 in addition to the Oakley groups included in [IKE] and the additional groups defined since [IANA IKE].
This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the IKE protocol and the concept of Oakley Groups, as defined in RFC 2409
RFC 2409 [IKE] defines five standard Oakley Groups: three modular exponentiation groups and two elliptic curve groups over GF[2^N].
One modular exponentiation group (768 bits Oakley Group 1) is mandatory for all implementations to support, while the other four are optional.
Thirteen additional groups subsequently have been defined and assigned values by IANA.
All of these additional groups are optional.
Of the eighteen groups defined so far, eight are MODP groups (exponentiation groups modulo a prime), and ten are EC2N groups (elliptic curve groups over GF[2^N]).
See [RFC3526] for more information on MODP groups.
The purpose of this document is to expand the options available to implementers of elliptic curve groups by adding three ECP groups (elliptic curve groups modulo a prime).
The reasons for adding such groups include the following.
The groups proposed afford efficiency advantages in software applications since the underlying arithmetic is integer arithmetic modulo a prime rather than binary field arithmetic.
(Additional computational advantages for these groups are presented in [GMN].)
The groups proposed encourage alignment with other elliptic curve standards.
The proposed groups are among those standardized by NIST, the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG), ISO, and ANSI.
(See Section 5 for details.)
The groups proposed are capable of providing security consistent with the new Advanced Encryption Standard.
These groups could also be defined using the New Group Mode, but including them in this RFC will encourage interoperability of IKE implementations based upon elliptic curve groups.
In addition, the availability of standardized groups will result in optimizations for a particular curve and field size and allow precomputation that could result in faster implementations.
In summary, due to the performance advantages of elliptic curve groups in IKE implementations and the need for further alignment with other standards, this document defines three elliptic curve groups based on modular arithmetic.
The keywords "MUST" and "SHOULD"
that appear in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The notation adopted in RFC 2409 [IKE] is used below to describe the new groups proposed.

Security Considerations Since this document proposes new groups for use within IKE and IKEv2, many of the security considerations contained within [IKE] and [IKEv2] apply here as well.
The groups proposed in this document correspond to the symmetric key sizes 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.
This allows the IKE key exchange to offer security comparable with the AES algorithms [AES].
The following table summarizes the appearance of these three elliptic curve groups in other standards.
[ISO 14888 3], [ISO 15946 2], [ISO 15946 3], and [ISO 15946 4].
IANA Considerations IANA has updated its registries of Diffie Hellman groups for IKE in [IANA IKE] and for IKEv2 in [IANA IKEv2] to include the groups defined above.
In [IANA IKE], the groups appear as new entries in the list of Diffie Hellman groups given by Group Description (attribute class 4).
The descriptions are "256 bit random ECP group", "384 bit random ECP group", and "521 bit random ECP group".
In each case, the group type (attribute class 5) has the value 2 (ECP, elliptic curve group over GF[P]).
In [IANA IKEv2], the groups appear as new entries in the list of IKEv2 transform type values for Transform Type 4
ECP Key Exchange Data Formats
In an ECP key exchange, the Diffie Hellman public value passed in a KE payload consists of two components, x and y, corresponding to the coordinates of an elliptic curve point.
Each component MUST have bit length as given in the following table.
This length is enforced, if necessary, by prepending the value with zeros.
The Diffie Hellman public value is obtained by concatenating the x and y values.
The format of the Diffie Hellman shared secret value is the same as that of the Diffie Hellman public value.
The following are examples of the IKEv2 key exchange payload for each of the three groups specified in this document.
We denote by g^n the scalar multiple of the point g by the integer n; it is another point on the curve.
In the literature, the scalar multiple is typically denoted ng; the notation g^n is used in order to conform to the notation used in [IKE] and [IKEv2].
