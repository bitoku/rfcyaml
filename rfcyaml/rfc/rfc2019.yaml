- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This memo specifies the MTU and frame format for transmission\
    \ of IPv6\n   [IPV6] packets on FDDI networks, including a method for MTU\n  \
    \ determination in the presence of 802.1d bridges to other media.  It\n   also\
    \ specifies the method of forming IPv6 link-local addresses on\n   FDDI networks\
    \ and the content of the Source/Target Link-layer Address\n   option used the\
    \ the Router Solicitation, Router Advertisement,\n   Neighbor Solicitation, and\
    \ Neighbor Advertisement messages described\n   in [DISC], when those messages\
    \ are transmitted on an FDDI network.\n"
- title: Maximum Transmission Unit
  contents:
  - "Maximum Transmission Unit\n   FDDI permits a frame length of 4500 octets (9000\
    \ symbols), including\n   at least 22 octets (44 symbols) of Data Link encapsulation\
    \ when\n   long-format addresses are used.  Subtracting 8 octets of LLC/SNAP\n\
    \   header, this would, in principle, allow the IPv6 packet in the\n   Information\
    \ field to be up to 4470 octets.  However, it is desirable\n   to allow for the\
    \ variable sizes and possible future extensions to the\n   MAC header and frame\
    \ status fields.  The default MTU size for IPv6\n   packets on an FDDI network\
    \ is therefore 4352 octets.  This size may\n   be reduced by a Router Advertisement\
    \ [DISC] containing an MTU option\n   which specifies a smaller MTU, or by manual\
    \ configuration of a\n   smaller value on each node.  If a Router Advertisement\
    \ is received\n   with an MTU option specifying an MTU larger than the default\
    \ or the\n   manually configured value, that MTU option may be logged to system\n\
    \   management but must be otherwise ignored.\n   For purposes of this document,\
    \ information received from DHCP is\n   considered \"manually configured\".\n"
- title: Frame Format
  contents:
  - "Frame Format\n   FDDI provides both synchronous and asynchronous transmission,\
    \ with\n   the latter class further subdivided by the use of restricted and\n\
    \   unrestricted tokens.  Only asynchronous transmission with\n   unrestricted\
    \ tokens is required for FDDI interoperability.\n   Accordingly, IPv6 packets\
    \ shall be sent in asynchronous frames using\n   unrestricted tokens.  The robustness\
    \ principle dictates that nodes\n   should be able to receive synchronous frames\
    \ and asynchronous frames\n   sent using restricted tokens.\n   IPv6 packets are\
    \ transmitted in LLC/SNAP frames, using long-format\n   (48 bit) addresses.  The\
    \ data field contains the IPv6 header and\n   payload and is followed by the FDDI\
    \ Frame Check Sequence, Ending\n   Delimiter, and Frame Status symbols.\n    \

- title: Interaction with Bridges
  contents:
  - "Interaction with Bridges\n   802.1d MAC bridges which connect different media,\
    \ for example\n   Ethernet and FDDI, have become very widespread.  Some of them\
    \ do IPv4\n   packet fragmentation and/or support IPv4 Path MTU discovery [PMTU],\n\
    \   many others do not, or do so incorrectly.  Use of IPv6 in a bridged\n   mixed-media\
    \ environment should not depend on support from MAC\n   bridges.\n   For correct\
    \ operation when mixed media are bridged together, the\n   smallest MTU of all\
    \ the media must be advertised by routers in an MTU\n   option.  If there are\
    \ no routers present, this MTU must be manually\n   configured in each node which\
    \ is connected to a medium with larger\n   default MTU.  Multicast packets on\
    \ such a bridged network must not be\n   larger than the smallest MTU of any of\
    \ the bridged media.  Often, the\n   subnetwork topology will support larger unicast\
    \ packets to be\n   exchanged between certain pairs of nodes.  To take advantage\
    \ of\n   high-MTU paths when possible, nodes transmitting IPv6 on FDDI should\n\
    \   implement the following simple mechanism for \"FDDI adjacency\n   detection\"\
    .\n   A node which implements FDDI adjacency detection and has it enabled\n  \
    \ on an FDDI interface must set a non-zero LLC priority in all Neighbor\n   Advertisement,\
    \ Neighbor Solicitation and, if applicable, Router\n   Advertisement frames transmitted\
    \ on that interface.  (In IEEE 802\n   language, the user_priority parameter of\
    \ the M_UNITDATA.request\n   primitive must not be zero.) If FDDI adjacency detection\
    \ has been\n   disabled on an FDDI interface, the priority field of those frames\n\
    \   must be zero.\n   Note that an IPv6 frame which originated on an Ethernet,\
    \ or traversed\n   an Ethernet, before being translated by an 802.1d bridge and\n\
    \   delivered to a node's FDDI interface will have zero in the priority\n   field,\
    \ as required by [BRIDGE].  (There's a fine point here: a\n   conforming bridge\
    \ may provide a management-settable Outbound User\n   Priority parameter for each\
    \ port.  However, the author is unaware of\n   any product that provides this\
    \ optional capability and, in any case,\n   the default value for the parameter\
    \ is zero.)\n   If a node N1 receives, in an FDDI frame with a non-zero LLC priority,\n\
    \   a valid Router Advertisement, Neighbor Advertisement, or Neighbor\n   Solicitation\
    \ from a node N2, then N1 may send unicast IPv6 packets to\n   N2 with sizes up\
    \ to the default IPv6 FDDI MTU (4352 octets),\n   regardless of any smaller MTU\
    \ configured manually or received in a\n   Router Advertisement MTU option.  N2\
    \ may be the IPv6 destination or\n   the next hop router to the destination.\n\
    \   Nodes implementing FDDI adjacency detection must provide a\n   configuration\
    \ option to disable the mechanism.  This option may be\n   used when a smaller\
    \ MTU is desired for reasons other than mixed-media\n   bridging.  By default,\
    \ FDDI adjacency detection should be enabled.\n   The only contemplated use of\
    \ the LLC priority field of the FC octet\n   is to aid in per-destination MTU\
    \ determination.  It would be\n   sufficient for that purpose to require only\
    \ that Router\n   Advertisements, Neighbor Advertisements, and Neighbor Solicitations\n\
    \   sent on FDDI always have non-zero priority.  However, it may be\n   simpler\
    \ or more useful to transmit all IPv6 packets on FDDI with\n   non-zero priority.\n"
