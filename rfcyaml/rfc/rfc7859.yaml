  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC7182] defines Integrity Check Value (ICV) TLVs for use\
    \ in packets\n   and messages that use the generalized MANET packet/message format\n\
    \   defined in [RFC5444].  This specification extends the TLV definitions\n  \
    \ therein by defining two new cryptographic function code points from\n   within\
    \ the registries set up by [RFC7182].  This allows the use of an\n   Identity-Based\
    \ Signature (IBS) as an ICV.  An IBS has an additional\n   property that is not\
    \ shared by all of the previously specified ICVs;\n   it not only indicates that\
    \ the protected packet or message is valid,\n   but also verifies the originator\
    \ of the packet/message.\n   This specification assumes that each router (i.e.,\
    \ each originator of\n   [RFC5444] format packets/messages) has an identity that\
    \ may be tied\n   to the packet or message.  The router may have more than one\
    \ identity\n   but will only use one for each ICV TLV.  The cryptographic strength\n\
    \   of the IBS is not dependent on the choice of identity.\n   Two options for\
    \ the choice of identity are supported (as reflected by\n   the two code points\
    \ allocated).  In the first option, the identity\n   can be any octet sequence\
    \ (up to 255 octets) included in the ICV TLV.\n   In the second option, the octet\
    \ sequence is preceded by an address,\n   either the IP source address for a Packet\
    \ TLV or the message\n   originator address for a Message TLV or an Address Block\
    \ TLV.  In\n   particular, the second option allows just the address to be used\
    \ as\n   an identity.\n   Identity-based signatures allow identification of the\
    \ originator of\n   information in a packet or message.  They thus allow additional\n\
    \   security functions, such as revocation of an identity.  (A router\n   could\
    \ also then remove all information recorded as from that revoked\n   originator;\
    \ the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2\n   (OLSRv2) [RFC7181],\
    \ an expected user of this specification, can do\n   this.)  When applied to messages\
    \ (rather than packets), this can\n   significantly reduce the damage that a compromised\
    \ router can inflict\n   on the network.\n   Identity-based signatures are based\
    \ on forms of asymmetric (public\n   key) cryptography - Identity-Based Encryption\
    \ (IBE).  Compared to\n   symmetric cryptographic methods (such as HMAC and AES),\
    \ IBE and IBS\n   methods avoid requiring a shared secret key that results in\
    \ a single\n   point of failure vulnerability.  Compared to more widely used\n\
    \   asymmetric (public key) cryptographic methods (such as RSA and\n   ECDSA),\
    \ IBE and IBS methods have a major advantage and a major\n   disadvantage.\n \
    \  The advantage referred to is that each router can be configured once\n   (for\
    \ its key lifetime) by a trusted authority, independently of all\n   other routers.\
    \  Thus, a router can connect to the authority\n   (typically in a secure environment)\
    \ to receive a private key or can\n   have a private key delivered securely (out\
    \ of band) from the\n   authority.  During normal operation of the MANET, there\
    \ is no need\n   for the trusted authority to be connected to the MANET or even\
    \ to\n   still exist.  Additional routers can be authorized with no reference\n\
    \   to previously authorized routers (the trusted authority must still\n   exist\
    \ in this case).  A router's public key is its identity, which\n   when tied to\
    \ a packet or message (as is the case when using an\n   address as, or as part\
    \ of, the identity) means that there is no need\n   for public key certificates\
    \ or a certificate authority, and a router\n   need not retain key material for\
    \ any other routers.\n   The disadvantage referred to is that the trusted authority\
    \ has\n   complete authority, even more so than a conventional certificate\n \
    \  authority.  Routers cannot generate their own private keys, only the\n   trusted\
    \ authority can do that.  Through the master secret held by the\n   trusted authority,\
    \ it could impersonate any router (existing or not).\n   When used for IBE (not\
    \ part of this specification), the trusted\n   authority can decrypt anything.\
    \  However, note that the shared secret\n   key options described in [RFC7182]\
    \ also have this limitation.\n   There are alternative mathematical realizations\
    \ of identity-based\n   signatures.  This specification uses one that has been\
    \ previously\n   published as [RFC6507], known as Elliptic Curve-Based Certificateless\n\
    \   Signatures for Identity-Based Encryption (ECCSI).  Similar to other\n   IBE/IBS\
    \ approaches, it is based on the use of elliptic curves.\n   Unlike some, it does\
    \ not use \"pairings\" (bilinear maps from a product\n   of two elliptic curve\
    \ groups to another group).  It thus may be\n   easier to implement and more efficient\
    \ than some alternatives,\n   although with a greater signature size than some.\
    \  This specification\n   allows the use of any elliptic curve that may be used\
    \ by [RFC6507].\n   The computational load imposed by ECCSI (and, perhaps more\
    \ so by\n   other IBS methods) is not trivial, though it depends significantly\
    \ on\n   the quality of implementation of the required elliptic curve and\n  \
    \ other mathematical functions.  For a security level of 128 bits, the\n   ICV\
    \ data length is 129 octets, which is longer than for alternative\n   ICVs specified\
    \ in [RFC7182] (e.g., 32 octets for the similar strength\n   HMAC-SHA-256).  The\
    \ signature format used could have been slightly\n   shortened (to 97 octets)\
    \ by using a compressed representation of an\n   elliptic curve point, however,\
    \ at the expense of some additional work\n   when verifying a signature and loss\
    \ of direct compatibility with\n   [RFC6507], and implementations thereof.\n \
    \  The trusted authority is referred to in [RFC6507] as the Key\n   Management\
    \ Service (KMS).  That term will be used in the rest of this\n   specification.\n"

    '
- title: 4.1.  Cryptographic Function
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Cryptographic Function\n   This specification defines a cryptographic function\
    \ named ECCSI that\n   is implemented as specified as the \"sign\" function in\
    \ Section 5.2.1\n   of [RFC6507].  To use that specification:\n   o  The ICV is\
    \ not calculated as cryptographic-function(hash-\n      function(content)) as\
    \ defined in [RFC7182] but (like the HMAC ICVs\n      defined in [RFC7182]) uses\
    \ the hash function within the\n      cryptographic function.  The option \"none\"\
    \ is not permitted for\n      hash-function, and the hash function must have a\
    \ known fixed\n      length of N octets (as specified in Section 4.2).\n   o \
    \ M, used in [RFC6507], is \"content\" as specified in [RFC7182].\n   o  ID, used\
    \ in [RFC6507], is as specified in Section 4.3.\n   o  Key Management Service\
    \ Public Authentication Key (KPAK), Secret\n      Signing Key (SSK), and Public\
    \ Validation Token (PVT), which are\n      provided by the KMS, are as specified\
    \ in Sections 4.2 and 5.1.1 of\n      [RFC6507].\n   The length of the signature\
    \ is 4N+1 octets (as specified in\n   [RFC6507]) whose affine coordinate format\
    \ (including an octet valued\n   0x04 to identify this) is used unchanged.\n \
    \  Verification of the ICV is not implemented by the receiver\n   recalculating\
    \ the ICV and comparing with the received ICV, as it is\n   necessarily incapable\
    \ of doing so.  Instead, the receiver evaluates\n   the \"verify\" function described\
    \ in Section 5.2.2 of [RFC6507], which\n   may pass or fail.\n   To use that function\
    \ M, KPAK, SSK, and PVT are as specified above,\n   while the Identifier (ID)\
    \ is deduced from the received packet or\n   message (as specified in Section\
    \ 4.3) using the <key-id> element in\n   the <ICV-value>.  This element need not\
    \ match that used by the\n   receiver, and thus when using this cryptographic\
    \ function, multiple\n   ICV TLVs differing only in their <key-id> or in the choice\
    \ of\n   cryptographic function from the two defined in this specification\n \
    \  SHOULD NOT be used unless routers are administratively configured to\n   recognize\
    \ which to verify.\n   Routers MAY be administratively configured to reject an\
    \ ICV TLV using\n   ECCSI based on part or all of <key-id>: for example, if this\
    \ encodes\n   a time after which this identity is no longer valid (as described\
    \ in\n   Section 4.3).\n"
- title: 4.2.  ECCSI Parameters
  contents:
  - "4.2.  ECCSI Parameters\n   Section 4.1 of [RFC6507] specifies parameters n, N,\
    \ p, E, B, G, and\n   q.  The first of these, n, is specified as \"A security\
    \ parameter; the\n   size in bits of the prime p over which elliptic curve cryptography\
    \ is\n   to be performed.\"  For typical security levels (e.g., 128, 192, and\n\
    \   256 bits), n must be at least twice the required bits of security;\n   see\
    \ Section 5.6.1 of [NIST-SP-800-57].\n   Selection of an elliptic curve, and all\
    \ related parameters, MUST be\n   made by administrative means, and known to all\
    \ routers.  Following\n   [RFC6507], it is RECOMMENDED that the curves and base\
    \ points defined\n   in Appendix D.1.2 of [NIST-FIPS-186-4] be used (note that\
    \ n in that\n   document is q in [RFC6507]).  However, an alternative curve MAY\
    \ be\n   used.\n   The parameter that is required by this specification is N,\
    \ which is\n   defined as Ceiling(n/8).  The hash function used must create an\n\
    \   output of size N octets.  For example, for 128 bit security, with n =\n  \
    \ 256 and N = 32, the RECOMMENDED hash function is SHA-256.  The\n   signature\
    \ (i.e., <ICV-data>) length is 4N+1 octets, i.e., 129 octets\n   for N = 32.\n\
    \   Note that [RFC6507] actually refers to the predecessor to\n   [NIST-FIPS-186-4],\
    \ but the latest version is specified here; there\n   are no significant differences\
    \ in this regard.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Identity
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Identity\n   There are two options for ID as used by [RFC6507], which are\n\
    \   indicated by there being two code points allocated for this\n   cryptographic\
    \ function, see Section 5.\n   o  For the cryptographic function ECCSI, ID is\
    \ the element <key-id>\n      defined in Section 12.1 of [RFC7182].  This MUST\
    \ NOT be empty.\n   o  For the cryptographic function ECCSI-ADDR, ID is the concatenation\n\
    \      of an address (in network byte order) and the element <key-id>\n      defined\
    \ in Section 12.1 of [RFC7182], where the latter MAY be\n      empty.\n      *\
    \  For a Packet TLV, this address is the IP source address of the\n         IP\
    \ datagram in which this packet is included.\n      *  For a Message TLV or an\
    \ Address Block TLV, this address is the\n         message originator address\
    \ (the element <msg-orig-addr> defined\n         in [RFC5444]) if that address\
    \ is present; if it is not present\n         and the message is known to have\
    \ traveled only one hop, then\n         the IP source address of the IP datagram\
    \ in which this message\n         is included is used.  Otherwise, no address\
    \ is defined and the\n         message MUST be rejected.  (Note that HELLO messages\
    \ specified\n         in NHDP [RFC6130] and used in OLSRv2 [RFC7181] always only\n\
    \         travel one hop; hence, their IP source address SHOULD be used\n    \
    \     if no originator address is present.)\n   The element <key-id> MAY be (for\
    \ the cryptographic function ECCSI-\n   ADDR) or include (for either cryptographic\
    \ function) a representation\n   of the identity expiry time.  This MAY use one\
    \ of the representations\n   of time defined for the TIMESTAMP TLV in [RFC7182].\
    \  A RECOMMENDED\n   approach is to use the cryptographic function ECCSI-ADDR\
    \ with element\n   <key-id> containing the single octet representing the type\
    \ of the\n   time, normally used as the TIMESTAMP TLV Type Extension (defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC7182], Table 9), or any extension thereof, followed by the time\n\
    \   as so represented, normally used as the TIMESTAMP TLV Value.\n   Note that\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This specification extends the security framework\
    \ for MANET routing\n   protocols specified in [RFC7182] by adding cryptographic\
    \ functions\n   (in two forms, according to how identity is specified).\n   This\
    \ cryptographic function implements a form of IBS; a stronger form\n   of ICV\
    \ that verifies not just that the received packet or message is\n   valid but\
    \ that the packet or message originated at a router that was\n   assigned a private\
    \ key for the specified identity.\n   It is recommended that the identity include\
    \ an address unique to that\n   router: for a message, its originator address,\
    \ and for a packet, the\n   corresponding IP packet source address.  If additional\
    \ information is\n   included in the identity, this may be to indicate an expiry\
    \ time for\n   signatures created using that identity.\n   In common with other\
    \ forms of IBS, a feature of the form of IBS\n   (known as ECCSI) used in this\
    \ specification is that it requires a\n   trusted KMS that issues all private\
    \ keys and has complete\n   cryptographic information about all possible private\
    \ keys.  However,\n   to set against that, the solution is scalable (as all routers\
    \ can be\n   independently keyed) and does not need the KMS in the network.  If\
    \ no\n   future keys will be required, then the KMS's master secret can be\n \
    \  destroyed.  As routers are individually keyed, key revocation (by\n   blacklist\
    \ and/or time expiry of keys) is possible.\n   ECCSI is based on elliptic curve\
    \ mathematics.  This specification\n   follows [RFC6507] in its recommendation\
    \ of elliptic curves, but any\n   suitable (prime power) elliptic curve may be\
    \ used; this must be\n   administratively specified.  Implementation of this specification\n\
    \   will require an available implementation of suitable mathematical\n   functions.\
    \  Unlike some other forms of IBS, ECCSI requires only basic\n   elliptic curve\
    \ operations; it does not require \"pairings\" (bilinear\n   functions of a product\
    \ of two elliptic curve groups).  This increases\n   the available range of suitable\
    \ mathematical libraries.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Experimental Status
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Experimental Status\n   The idea of using identity-based signatures for\
    \ authentication of ad\n   hoc network signaling goes back at least as far as\
    \ 2005 [Dearlove].\n   The specific implementation of an IBS used in this specification,\n\
    \   ECCSI, was published as an Internet Draft in 2010 before publication\n   as\
    \ an Informational RFC [RFC6507].  ECCSI is now part of standards\n   such as\
    \ [ETSI] for LTE Proximity-based Services.  An open-source\n   implementation\
    \ of cryptographic software that includes ECCSI is\n   available, see [SecureChorus].\n\
    \   However, although this specification has been implemented for use in\n   an\
    \ OLSRv2 [RFC7181] routed network, there are only limited reports of\n   such\
    \ use.  There are also no reports of the use of ECCSI within the\n   IETF, other\
    \ than in this specification.  There are no reports of\n   independent public\
    \ scrutiny of the algorithm, although ECCSI is\n   reported [RFC6507] as being\
    \ based on [ECDSA] with similar properties.\n   This specification is thus published\
    \ as Experimental in order to\n   encourage its use and encourage reports on its\
    \ use.  Once experiments\n   have been carried out and reported on (and when some\
    \ public analysis\n   of the underlying cryptographic algorithms is available),\
    \ it is\n   intended to advance this specification, with any changes identified\n\
    \   by such experimentation and analysis, to Standards Track.\n"

    \ (e.g., 0 for\n   HELLO) and by selecting example values where needed.  The latter\n\
    \   means that\n   o  The message sequence number will be zero.\n   o  The five\
