Abstract This document defines a new media type for TimeStampedData envelopes as described in RFC 5544.
This document defines a new media type for TimeStampedData envelopes.
A TimeStampedData envelope, described in [RFC5544], binds a file with one or more time stamp tokens obtained for that file.
A media type registration, lacking in [RFC5544], enhances shareability.
