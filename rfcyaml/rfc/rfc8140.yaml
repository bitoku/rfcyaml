  - "Abstract\n   Ever since Gutenberg discovered and patented ASCII and the\n   corresponding\
    \ \"Courier New\" font with its now-famous \"ten\" point\n   size, artisans and\
    \ artificers have striven to represent their views\n   of the world in print.\n\
    \   Similarly, starting from Darwin's discovery of the hippogriff and his\n  \
    \ subsequent registration of the creature as an International Trade\n   Mark,\
    \ men (and some women) have struggled to catalog the fabulous\n   variety that\
    \ is called \"nature\".\n   This document supplies a number of representations\
    \ of all manner of\n   things (both elemental and hypothetical) supplied by some\
    \ of our best\n   collectors of curios and delivered in a manner that may well\
    \ be\n   reused by the cunning document author.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, where princes\
    \ were\n   available to those who knew how to kiss, and frogs could be picked\
    \ up\n   by the handful and were sold in brown paper bags at the shop on the\n\
    \   corner of your street, there was an impish discovery made by the\n   appropriately\
    \ named Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg.\n   His name, it turned\
    \ out, was coincidentally fortuitous for when he\n   uncovered the Gutenberg Press\
    \ he was able to claim it as his own.\n   Amongst Gutenberg's better known discoveries\
    \ were the ten point font,\n   the Courier New Font (which he is supposed to have\
    \ found growing in a\n   hedgerow close to his cottage), and the ASCII character\
    \ set.  All of\n   these have been embraced as comforting and warm blankets by\
    \ the\n   engineers of the IETF as they embark on expeditions to plot the\n  \
    \ desolated wastes of the Internet.\n   Although the RFC Editor has recently dragged\
    \ the IETF kicking and\n   screaming into the twentieth century [RFC7990] [RFC7996],\
    \ there is a\n   yearning among all right-thinking Internet architects to \"keep\
    \ it\n   simple\" and to return to the olden days when pigs could be given\n \
    \  thrust without anyone taking undue offence [RFC1925].  This document\n   attempts\
    \ to address that yearning by demonstrating the full wonder of\n   the natural\
    \ world in vivid two-dimensional representation and a\n   colour palette that\
    \ would put even the august L. S. Lowry to shame.\n   Readers of this document\
    \ are encouraged to be familiar.\n"

  - "2.  Beasts of the Land\n   \"Many and wonderful are the beasts of the land\"\
    \ wrote the poet.  And\n   he was right in some ways.\n   Of these many beasts,\

    \ of sightings in the\n   field.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  The Troll\n   The troll is an evil beast that frequently appears around\
    \ the IETF.\n   It feeds alternately on passing goats and cookies, but it prefers\n\
    \   above all things the taste of distress, especially that expressed in\n   email.\n\
    \   Trolls should be shunned and never fed.  Stories about them being\n   sensitive\
    \ to water or light are unsubstantiated, but it may be true\n   that they can\
    \ be pacified with alcohol.\n   The chief weapons of a Troll are its sharp tongue,\
    \ its blunt\n   phrasing, and its total disregard for doing useful work.\n   \

    \ pixie dust or other\n   artful contributions from the world of faerie, it is\
    \ unlikely that\n   the Internet would work at all.\n   Software Defined Networking\
    \ (SDN) is a concept whereby complex and\n   devious networks may be subjugated\
    \ to the will of a sorcerer (or an\n   opensourcerer as they are sometimes know).\
    \  Fundamental to the body\n   of an SDN is the Path Computation Element (PCE)\
    \ [RFC7399].  Essential\n   to the proper function of the PCE is the Unicorn that\
    \ roams the dark\n   wood of the Traffic Engineering Database, rearing up and\
    \ spearing\n   unwitting paths on the horn of its intellect.\n   Unicorns, it\
