- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As written, RFC 2418 [RFC2418] gives WG chairs more authority\
    \ to\n   manage face-to-face discussions than to manage mailing list\n   discussions.\
    \  In face-to-face meetings, the WG chair has the\n   authority \"to refuse to\
    \ grant the floor to any individual who is\n   unprepared or otherwise covering\
    \ inappropriate material, or who, in\n   the opinion of the Chair, is disrupting\
    \ the WG process.\"  However,\n   RFC 2418 does not give the WG Chair the authority\
    \ to suspend the\n   mailing list posting privileges of an individual who is similarly\n\
    \   disrupting WG mailing list discussions.  RFC 2418 explicitly requires\n  \
    \ full IESG approval for this action.\n   This document is an update to RFC 2418,\
    \ section 3.2.  It gives WG\n   chairs the authority to temporarily suspend the\
    \ posting privileges of\n   disruptive individuals without IESG approval.\n"
- title: 2.  Specific Changes to RFC 2418
  contents:
  - "2.  Specific Changes to RFC 2418\n   The following paragraphs supersede the last\
    \ paragraph of RFC 2418,\n   section 3.2:\n   As in face-to-face sessions, occasionally\
    \ one or more individuals may\n   engage in behavior on a mailing list that, in\
    \ the opinion of the WG\n   chair, is disruptive to the WG process.  Unless the\
    \ disruptive\n   behavior is severe enough that it must be stopped immediately,\
    \ the WG\n   chair should attempt to discourage the disruptive behavior by\n \
    \  communicating directly with the offending individual.  If the\n   behavior\
    \ persists, the WG chair should send at least one public\n   warning on the WG\
    \ mailing list.  As a last resort and typically after\n   one or more explicit\
    \ warnings and consultation with the responsible\n   Area Director, the WG chair\
    \ may suspend the mailing list posting\n   privileges of the disruptive individual\
    \ for a period of not more than\n   30 days.  Even while posting privileges are\
    \ suspended, the individual\n   must not be prevented from receiving messages\
    \ posted to the list.\n   Like all other WG chair decisions, any suspension of\
    \ posting\n   privileges is subject to appeal, as described in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].\n\
    \   This mechanism is intended to permit a WG chair to suspend posting\n   privileges\
    \ of a disruptive individual for a short period of time.\n   This mechanism does\
    \ not permit WG chairs to suspend an individual's\n   posting privileges for a\
    \ period longer than 30 days regardless of the\n   type or severity of the disruptive\
    \ incident.  However, further\n   disruptive behavior by the same individual will\
    \ be considered\n   separately and may result in further warnings or suspensions.\
    \  Other\n   methods of mailing list control, including longer suspensions, must\n\
    \   be carried out in accordance with other IETF-approved procedures.\n   See\
    \ BCP 83 [RFC3683] for one set of procedures already defined and\n   accepted\
    \ by the community.\n"
