  - "                        LINK NUMBER ASSIGNMENTS\n     Today Steve Crocker asked\
    \ me to announce that from now on link\nnumbers 2-71 (decimal), inclusive, are\
    \ to be valid for use in\nconnections.  Accordingly, the Host-Host Protocol Document,\
    \ which I am\ncurrently writing, will contain the following \"declarative\nspecification\"\
    .\n     Links are assigned as follows:\n     Link Number         Assignment\n\
    \     0                   Control link\n     2-71                Available for\
    \ connections\n     1, 72-190           Reserved-not for current use\n     191\
    \                 To be used only for measurement\n                         work\
    \ under the direction of the\n                         Network Measurement Center\
    \ at UCLA\n     192-255             Available for private experimental use\n \
