- contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Current specification of Mobile IP [1] does not allow for\n
    \  organizations and vendors to include organization/vendor-specific\n   information
    in the Mobile IP messages.  With the imminent wide scale\n   deployment of Mobile
    IP it is useful to have vendor or organization-\n   Specific Extensions to support
    this capability.  This document\n   defines two extensions that can be used for
    making organization\n   specific extensions by vendors/organizations for their
    own specific\n   purposes.\n"

      \  of the specification.\n   silently discard\n            The implementation
      discards the datagram without further\n            processing, and without indicating
      an error to the sender.\n            The implementation SHOULD provide the capability
      of logging\n            the error, including the contents of the discarded datagram,\n
      \           and SHOULD record the event in a statistics counter.\n"

    Extensions are described, Critical\n   (CVSE) and Normal (NVSE) Vendor/Organization
    Specific Extensions.\n   The basic differences between the Critical and Normal
    Extensions are\n   that when the Critical extension is encountered but not recognized,\n
    \  the message containing the extension MUST be silently discarded,\n   whereas
    when a Normal Vendor/Organization Specific Extension is\n   encountered but not
    recognized, the extension SHOULD be ignored, but\n   the rest of the Extensions
    and message data MUST still be processed.\n   Another difference between the two
    is that Critical\n   Vendor/Organization Extension has a length field of two octets

    - "2.3 Vendor/Organization Specific Extensions Processing Considerations\n   When
      a Mobile IP entity receives a registration request message (or\n   any other
      request/update message) with an extension of type CVSE-\n   TYPE-NUMBER and
      recognizes it, but the extension contains an\n   unknown/unsupported vendor
      ID or Vendor-CVSE-Type, a registration\n   reject (or the appropriate deny message)
      MUST be sent with the error\n   code to indicate that the registration was rejected
      due to the\n   presence of an unknown CVSE.\n   When a Mobile IP entity receives
      a registration reply (or any other\n   mobile IP reply/acknowledgement message)
      with an extension of type\n   CVSE-TYPE-NUMBER and recognizes it, but the extensions
      contains an\n   unknown/unsupported vendor ID or Vendor-CVSE-Type, the processing
      is\n   performed as described below.\n   1. If the Mobile IP entity is a transit
      node for the reply (i.e.,\n   this entity processes and sends the registration
      reply to another\n   entity) a registration reject (or the appropriate deny
      message) MUST\n   be sent with the error code to indicate that the registration
      was\n   rejected due to the presence of an unknown CVSE.  For example, FA\n
      \  when it receives an unknown CVSE in a registration reply from the HA,\n   should
      send a registration reject to the MN.\n   2. If the Mobile IP entity is not
      a transit node for the reply, the\n   reply is treated as a reject (or the appropriate
      deny message) due to\n   the presence of an unknown CVSE.\n   While designing
      enhancements wherein a CVSE is included in a reply\n   message, it should noted
      that the reply message could be discarded by\n   the mobile IP entity processing
      this message.  Enhancements that\n   include a CVSE should take this into consideration
      during design.\n   When a Mobile IP entity receives a mobile IP related message\n
      \  (registration request/reply, advertisement/solicitation, etc.) with\n   an
      extension of type NVSE-TYPE-NUMBER and recognizes it, but the\n   extension
      contains an unknown/unsupported vendor ID or Vendor-NVSE-\n   Type, the entire
      extension is skipped.\n   NOTE that according to RFC 2002 [1], when an extension
      numbered\n   within the range 0 through 127 is encountered in a registration\n
      \  message but not recognized, the message containing that extension\n   MUST
      be silently discarded.  This document is compliant with the\n   above specification
      and specifies the action if the extension of type\n   CVSE-TYPE-NUMBER is encountered
      and recognized, but does not support\n   the vendor ID or the vendor type extension
      within.\n"
