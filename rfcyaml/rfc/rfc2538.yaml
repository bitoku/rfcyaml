  - "1. Introduction\n   Public keys are frequently published in the form of a certificate\
    \ and\n   their authenticity is commonly demonstrated by certificates and\n  \
    \ related certificate revocation lists (CRLs).  A certificate is a\n   binding,\
    \ through a cryptographic digital signature, of a public key,\n   a validity interval\
    \ and/or conditions, and identity, authorization,\n   or other information. A\
    \ certificate revocation list is a list of\n   certificates that are revoked,\
    \ and incidental information, all signed\n   by the signer (issuer) of the revoked\
    \ certificates. Examples are\n   X.509 certificates/CRLs in the X.500 directory\
    \ system or PGP\n   certificates/revocations used by PGP software.\n   Section\
    \ 2 below specifies a CERT resource record (RR) for the storage\n   of certificates\
    \ in the Domain Name System.\n   Section 3 discusses appropriate owner names for\
    \ CERT RRs.\n   Sections 4, 5, and 6 below cover performance, IANA, and security\n\
    \   considerations, respectively.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"

  - "2. The CERT Resource Record\n   The CERT resource record (RR) has the structure\
    \ given below.  Its RR\n   type code is 37.\n                         1 1 1 1\

    \   The type field is the certificate type as define in section 2.1\n   below.\n\
    \   The algorithm field has the same meaning as the algorithm field in\n   KEY\
    \ and SIG RRs [RFC 2535] except that a zero algorithm field\n   indicates the\
    \ algorithm is unknown to a secure DNS, which may simply\n   be the result of\
    \ the algorithm not having been standardized for\n   secure DNS.\n   The key tag\
    \ field is the 16 bit value computed for the key embedded\n   in the certificate\
    \ as specified in the DNSSEC Standard [RFC 2535].\n   This field is used as an\
    \ efficiency measure to pick which CERT RRs\n   may be applicable to a particular\
    \ key.  The key tag can be calculated\n   for the key in question and then only\
    \ CERT RRs with the same key tag\n   need be examined. However, the key must always\
    \ be transformed to the\n   format it would have as the public key portion of\
    \ a KEY RR before the\n   key tag is computed.  This is only possible if the key\
    \ is applicable\n   to an algorithm (and limits such as key size limits) defined\
    \ for DNS\n   security.  If it is not, the algorithm field MUST BE zero and the\
    \ tag\n   field is meaningless and SHOULD BE zero.\n"

    \    65535            reserved\n   The PKIX type is reserved to indicate an X.509\
    \ certificate conforming\n   to the profile being defined by the IETF PKIX working\
    \ group.  The\n   certificate section will start with a one byte unsigned OID\
    \ length\n   and then an X.500 OID indicating the nature of the remainder of the\n\
    \   certificate section (see 2.3 below).  (NOTE: X.509 certificates do\n   not\
    \ include their X.500 directory type designating OID as a prefix.)\n   The SPKI\
    \ type is reserved to indicate a certificate formated as to be\n   specified by\
    \ the IETF SPKI working group.\n   The PGP type indicates a Pretty Good Privacy\
    \ certificate as described\n   in RFC 2440 and its extensions and successors.\n\
    \   The URI private type indicates a certificate format defined by an\n   absolute\
    \ URI.  The certificate portion of the CERT RR MUST begin with\n   a null terminated\
    \ URI [RFC 2396] and the data after the null is the\n   private format certificate\
    \ itself.  The URI SHOULD be such that a\n   retrieval from it will lead to documentation\
    \ on the format of the\n   certificate.  Recognition of private certificate types\
    \ need not be\n   based on URI equality but can use various forms of pattern matching\n\
    \   so that, for example, subtype or version information can also be\n   encoded\
    \ into the URI.\n   The OID private type indicates a private format certificate\
    \ specified\n   by a an ISO OID prefix.  The certificate section will start with\
    \ a\n   one byte unsigned OID length and then a BER encoded OID indicating\n \
    \  the nature of the remainder of the certificate section.  This can be\n   an\
    \ X.509 certificate format or some other format.  X.509 certificates\n   that\
    \ conform to the IETF PKIX profile SHOULD be indicated by the PKIX\n   type, not\
    \ the OID private type.  Recognition of private certificate\n   types need not\
    \ be based on OID equality but can use various forms of\n   pattern matching such\
    \ as OID prefix.\n"
- title: 2.2 Text Representation of CERT RRs
  contents:
  - "2.2 Text Representation of CERT RRs\n   The RDATA portion of a CERT RR has the\
    \ type field as an unsigned\n   integer or as a mnemonic symbol as listed in section\
    \ 2.1 above.\n   The key tag field is represented as an unsigned integer.\n  \
    \ The algorithm field is represented as an unsigned integer or a\n   mnemonic\
    \ symbol as listed in [RFC 2535].\n   The certificate / CRL portion is represented\
    \ in base 64 and may be\n   divided up into any number of white space separated\
    \ substrings, down\n   to single base 64 digits, which are concatenated to obtain\
    \ the full\n   signature.  These substrings can span lines using the standard\n\
    \   parenthesis.\n   Note that the certificate / CRL portion may have internal\
    \ sub-fields\n   but these do not appear in the master file representation.  For\n\
    \   example, with type 254, there will be an OID size, an OID, and then\n   the\
    \ certificate / CRL proper. But only a single logical base 64\n   string will\

    \ list CERT\n   RRs be stored under a domain name related to their issuer.\n \
    \  Following some of the guidelines below may result in the use in DNS\n   names\
    \ of characters that require DNS quoting which is to use a\n   backslash followed\

  - "3.1 X.509 CERT RR Names\n   Some X.509 versions permit multiple names to be associated\
    \ with\n   subjects and issuers under \"Subject Alternate Name\" and \"Issuer\n\
    \   Alternate Name\".  For example, x.509v3 has such Alternate Names with\n  \
    \ an ASN.1 specification as follows:\n         GeneralName ::= CHOICE {\n    \
    \        otherName                  [0] INSTANCE OF OTHER-NAME,\n            rfc822Name\

    \       registeredID               [8] OBJECT IDENTIFIER\n         }\n   The recommended\
    \ locations of CERT storage are as follows, in priority\n   order:\n   (1) If\
    \ a domain name is included in the identification in the\n       certificate or\
    \ CRL, that should be used.\n   (2) If a domain name is not included but an IP\
    \ address is included,\n       then the translation of that IP address into the\
    \ appropriate\n       inverse domain name should be used.\n   (3) If neither of\
    \ the above it used but a URI containing a domain\n       name is present, that\
    \ domain name should be used.\n   (4) If none of the above is included but a character\
    \ string name is\n       included, then it should be treated as described for\
    \ PGP names in\n       3.2 below.\n   (5) If none of the above apply, then the\
    \ distinguished name (DN)\n       should be mapped into a domain name as specified\
    \ in RFC 2247.\n   Example 1: Assume that an X.509v3 certificate is issued to\
    \ /CN=John\n   Doe/DC=Doe/DC=com/DC=xy/O=Doe Inc/C=XY/ with Subject Alternative\n\
    \   names of (a) string \"John (the Man) Doe\", (b) domain name john-\n   doe.com,\
    \ and (c) uri <https://www.secure.john-doe.com:8080/>.  Then\n   the storage locations\
    \ recommended, in priority order, would be\n       (1) john-doe.com,\n       (2)\
    \ www.secure.john-doe.com, and\n       (3) Doe.com.xy.\n   Example 2:  Assume\
    \ that an X.509v3 certificate is issued to /CN=James\n   Hacker/L=Basingstoke/O=Widget\
    \ Inc/C=GB/ with Subject Alternate names\n   of (a) domain name widget.foo.example,\
    \ (b) IPv4 address\n   10.251.13.201, and (c) string \"James Hacker\n   <hacker@mail.widget.foo.example>\"\
    .  Then the storage locations\n   recommended, in priority order, would be\n \
    \       (1) widget.foo.example,\n        (2) 201.13.251.10.in-addr.arpa, and\n\
    \        (3) hacker.mail.widget.foo.example.\n"
- title: 3.2 PGP CERT RR Names
  contents:
  - "3.2 PGP CERT RR Names\n   PGP signed keys (certificates) use a general character\
    \ string User ID\n   [RFC 2440]. However, it is recommended by PGP that such names\
    \ include\n   the RFC 822 email address of the party, as in \"Leslie Example\n\
    \   <Leslie@host.example>\".  If such a format is used, the CERT should be\n \
    \  under the standard translation of the email address into a domain\n   name,\
    \ which would be leslie.host.example in this case.  If no RFC 822\n   name can\
    \ be extracted from the string name no specific domain name is\n   recommended.\n"
- title: 4. Performance Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Performance Considerations\n   Current Domain Name System (DNS) implementations\
    \ are optimized for\n   small transfers, typically not more than 512 bytes including\n\
    \   overhead.  While larger transfers will perform correctly and work is\n   underway\
    \ to make larger transfers more efficient, it is still\n   advisable at this time\
    \ to make every reasonable effort to minimize\n   the size of certificates stored\
    \ within the DNS.  Steps that can be\n   taken may include using the fewest possible\
    \ optional or extensions\n   fields and using short field values for variable\
    \ length fields that\n   must be included.\n"
- title: 5. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. IANA Considerations\n   Certificate types 0x0000 through 0x00FF and 0xFF00\
    \ through 0xFFFF can\n   only be assigned by an IETF standards action [RFC 2434]\
    \ (and this\n   document assigns 0x0001 through 0x0003 and 0x00FD and 0x00FE).\n\
    \   Certificate types 0x0100 through 0xFEFF are assigned through IETF\n   Consensus\
    \ [RFC 2434] based on RFC documentation of the certificate\n   type.  The availability\
    \ of private types under 0x00FD and 0x00FE\n   should satisfy most requirements\
    \ for proprietary or private types.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   By definition, certificates contain their own\
    \ authenticating\n   signature.  Thus it is reasonable to store certificates in\
    \ non-secure\n   DNS zones or to retrieve certificates from DNS with DNS security\n\
    \   checking not implemented or deferred for efficiency.  The results MAY\n  \
    \ be trusted if the certificate chain is verified back to a known\n   trusted\
    \ key and this conforms with the user's security policy.\n   Alternatively, if\
    \ certificates are retrieved from a secure DNS zone\n   with DNS security checking\
    \ enabled and are verified by DNS security,\n   the key within the retrieved certificate\
    \ MAY be trusted without\n   verifying the certificate chain if this conforms\
    \ with the user's\n   security policy.\n   CERT RRs are not used in connection\
    \ with securing the DNS security\n   additions so there are no security considerations\
    \ related to CERT RRs\n   and securing the DNS itself.\n"
