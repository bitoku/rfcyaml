  - "                 RAND/UCSB NETWORK GRAPHICS EXPERIMENT\nINTRODUCTION\n   During\
    \ the Network Graphics Meeting in July, several experiments were\n   outlined\
    \ to explore graphics over the Network.  One of these was the\n   use of the UCSB\
    \ On-Line System (OLS) from graphic consoles at Rand.\n   The connection was completed\
    \ in the latter half of August and has\n   been used on an experimental basis\
    \ since then.  OLS users from UCSB\n   and TRW (in Los Angeles) have visited Rand\
    \ and accessed OLS via Rand\n   consoles and the Network.  Thus, the first phase\
    \ of the experiment\n   was completed in August.\n   We are still in the midst\
    \ of the second phase of the experiment which\n   involves cleaning up the initial\
    \ implementation and reviewing and\n   modifying our initial strategies for the\
    \ OLS connection.\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXPERIMENT\nUCSB\n   UCSB has had a Network\
    \ interface on the OLS for some time.  For a\n   description, see RFC #74.  The\
    \ descriptions in RFC #74 were modified\n   to conform to current Network protocols\
    \ (NCP and ICP) and to conform\n   to what we considered a general graphics description.\n\
    \   Basically, the OLS receives an EBCDIC-like input byte stream and\n   generates\
    \ an unstructured graphical output stream.  These protocols\n   will be documented\
    \ at the completion of our experimentation and\n   presented at the Network graphics\
    \ meeting in October.\n   The Rand Video-Graphics System (VGS) was used to access\
    \ the OLS via\n   the Network.  The Video-Graphics System and its consoles are\n\
    \   described in R-753-ARPA available from the Rand Reports Department.\n   VGS\
    \ consoles had been connected previously to the Network via the\n   Rand Network\
    \ Services Program (NSP).  Originally, NSP was designed to\n   afford NCP checkout\
    \ features, logging in to and use of remote systems\n   and access to UCSB RJE\
    \ and UCLA RJS.  An additional module was easily\n   added to access the OLS.\n\
    \   Input to the OLS was done via a Rand tablet on a VGS console.  Input\n   to\
    \ the OLS module in NSP is accomplished by moving the tablet cursor\n   (not shown\
    \ in the attached figures) which appears as a small dot on\n   the screen to the\
    \ desired function button and pressing the tablet pen\n   down on the tablet.\n\
    \   Figure 1 shows the initial display from the OLS module.  The top of\n   the\
    \ screen has a feedback line, the remainder of the upper half is\n   the output\
    \ display from the OLS, and the lower half is a large\n   sensitive area containing\
    \ various function buttons (pic-table).\n   The sensitive areas fall into three\
    \ classes:\n          (1)  the right most column (CALL, CLOSE)\n          connects/disconnects\
    \ to OLS over the Network.\n          The third function (COPY) generates hardcopy\n\
    \          via an SC 4060. (The figures are, in fact,\n          SC 4060 hardcopy.)\n\
    \          (2)  The grid area contains the OLS function\n          buttons normally\
    \ on a special function keyboard.\n          (See RFC #74.)\n          (3)  The\
    \ lower area allows entry of number,\n          characters and punctuation.\n\
    \   Figure 2 shows the login sequence to OLS and Figure 3, SIN and COS\n   curves\
    \ from -PI to +PI generated by OLS.\n   Completion of the Experiment\n   We plan\
    \ to present the experiment at the October graphics meeting in\n   two forms.\
    \  First, a description of the protocols and techniques used\n   in implementing\
    \ the remote network connection along with conclusions.\n   Second, we will make\
    \ a film showing the use of the OLS from Rand and\n   present it at the meeting.\n\
