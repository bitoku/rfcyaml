  - "         Proposed Change to Host/IMP Spec to Eliminate Marking\n    Before he\
    \ left for Norway, Dave Walden observed that there was a\nsimple change to the\
    \ Host/IMP specifications which would eliminate all\n\"marking\" problems.  The\
    \ change is to separate the leader from the text\nof regular messages, and then\
    \ to send them as consecutive messages\ninstead of one packed message.  The text\
    \ would then start on a word\nboundary no matter what the word lengths of the\
    \ machines involved.  The\nprocess would take place on both IMP-to-Host and Host-to-IMP\
    \ messages.\n    We can see no disadvantages to this scheme, and a sampling of\
    \ Host\nreactions range from neutral to wildly enthusiastic.  Therefore, we\n\
    tentatively plan to implement this change.  We recognize that this\nchange will\
    \ involve Host program changes, and that the new release must\nbe scheduled to\
    \ coincide with those changes.  We propose providing\nmodified Host spec text\
    \ along with a one week notice of the new release.\n    If anyone sees a flaw\
    \ in this scheme, or is unhappy about it, please\ncontact BBN quickly, since a\
    \ new version of the IMP program is already\nin the works.\n       [ This RFC\
    \ was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n        [ into the online RFC\
    \ archives by Kai Henningsen 5/97 ]\n"
