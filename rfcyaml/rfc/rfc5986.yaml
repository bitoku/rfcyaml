  - "1.  Introduction and Overview\n   The location of a Device is a useful and sometimes
    necessary part of\n   many services.  A Location Information Server (LIS) is responsible\n
    \  for providing that location information to Devices with attached\n   access
    networks used to provide Internet access.  The LIS uses\n   knowledge of the access
    network and its physical topology to generate\n   and serve location information
    to Devices.\n   Each access network requires specific knowledge about topology.\n
    \  Therefore, it is important to discover the LIS that has the specific\n   knowledge
    necessary to locate a Device, that is, the LIS that serves\n   the current access
    network.  Automatic discovery is important where\n   there is any chance of movement
    outside a single access network.\n   Reliance on static configuration can lead
    to unexpected errors if a\n   Device moves between access networks.\n   This document
    describes a process that a Device can use to discover a\n   LIS.  This process
    uses a DHCP option and the DNS.  The product of\n   this discovery process is
    an HTTP [RFC2616] or HTTPS [RFC2818] URI\n   that identifies a LIS.\n   The URI
    result from the discovery process is suitable for location\n   configuration only;
    that is, the Device MUST dereference the URI\n   using the process described in
    HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)\n   [RFC5985].  URIs discovered in this
    way are not \"location URIs\"\n   [RFC5808]; dereferencing one of them provides
    the location of the\n   requestor only.  Devices MUST NOT embed these URIs in
    fields in other\n   protocols designed to carry the location of the Device.\n"

    - "1.1.  Discovery Procedure Overview\n   DHCP ([RFC2131], [RFC3315]) is a commonly
      used mechanism for\n   providing bootstrap configuration information that allows
      a Device to\n   operate in a specific network environment.  The DHCP information
      is\n   largely static, consisting of configuration information that does not\n
      \  change over the period that the Device is attached to the network.\n   Physical
      location information might change over this time; however,\n   the address of
      the LIS does not.  Thus, DHCP is suitable for\n   configuring a Device with
      the address of a LIS.\n   This document defines a DHCP option that produces
      a domain name that\n   identifies the local access network in Section 3.\n   Section
      4 describes a method that uses URI-enabled NAPTR (U-NAPTR)\n   [RFC4848], a
      Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS) profile that\n   produces a URI
      for the LIS.  The input to this process is provided by\n   the DHCP option.\n
      \  For the LIS discovery DDDS application, an Application Service tag\n   \"LIS\"
      and an Application Protocol tag \"HELD\" have been created and\n   registered
      with the IANA.  Based on the domain name, this U-NAPTR\n   application uses
      the two tags to determine a URI for a LIS that\n   supports the HELD protocol.\n"

      \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and
      \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n
      \  This document also uses the term \"Device\" to refer to an end host or\n
      \  client consistent with its use in HELD.  In HELD and RFC 3693\n   [RFC3693]
      parlance, the Device is also the Target.\n   The term \"access network\" refers
      to the network to which a Device\n   connects for Internet access.  The \"access
      network provider\" is the\n   entity that operates the access network.  This
      is consistent with the\n   definition in [RFC5687], which combines the Internet
      Access Provider\n   (IAP) and Internet Service Provider (ISP).  The access network\n
      \  provider is responsible for allocating the Device a public IP address\n   and
      for directly or indirectly providing a LIS service.\n"

  - "2.  LIS Discovery Procedure\n   A Device that has multiple network interfaces
    could potentially be\n   served by a different access network on each interface,
    each with a\n   different LIS.  The Device SHOULD attempt to discover the LIS\n
    \  applicable to each network interface, stopping when a LIS is\n   successfully
    discovered on any interface.\n   The LIS discovery procedure follows this process:\n
    \  1.  Acquire the access network domain name (Section 3).\n       This process
    might be repeated for each of the network interfaces\n       on the Device.  Domain
    names acquired from other sources might\n       also be added.\n   2.  Apply U-NAPTR
    resolution (Section 4) to discover a LIS URI.\n       The U-NAPTR process is applied
    using each of the domain names as\n       input.\n   3.  Verify that the LIS is
    able to provide location information.\n       The first URI that results in a
    successful response from the LIS\n       is used.\n   A Device MUST support discovery
    using the access network domain name\n   DHCP option (Section 3) as input to U-NAPTR
    resolution (Section 4).\n   If this option is not available, DHCPv4 option 15
    [RFC2132] is used.\n   Other domain names MAY be used, as described in Section
    3.4.\n   A Device that discovers a LIS URI MUST attempt to verify that the LIS\n
    \  is able to provide location information.  For the HELD protocol, the\n   Device
    verifies the URI by making a location request to the LIS.  Any\n   HTTP 200 response
    containing a HELD response signifies success.  This\n   includes HELD error responses,
    with the exception of the\n   \"notLocatable\" error.\n   If -- at any time --
    the LIS responds to a request with the\n   \"notLocatable\" error code (see Section
    4.3.2 of [RFC5985]), the\n   Device MUST continue or restart the discovery process.
    \ A Device\n   SHOULD NOT make further requests to a LIS that provides a\n   \"notLocatable\"
    error until its network attachment changes, or it\n   discovers the LIS on an
    alternative network interface.\n   Static configuration of a domain name or a
    LIS URI MAY be used.  Note\n   that if a Device has moved from its customary location,
    static\n   configuration might indicate a LIS that is unable to provide accurate\n
    \  location information.\n   The product of the LIS discovery process for HELD
    is an HTTPS or HTTP\n   URI.  Nothing distinguishes this URI from other URIs with
    the same\n   scheme, aside from the fact that it is the product of this process.\n
    \  Only URIs produced by the discovery process can be used for location\n   configuration
    using HELD.\n   The overall discovery process is summarized in Figure 1.\n       -----------\n

    - "2.1.  Residential Gateways\n   The options available in residential gateways
      will affect the success\n   of this algorithm in residential network scenarios.
      \ A fixed wireline\n   scenario is described in more detail in [RFC5687], Section
      3.1.  In\n   this fixed wireline environment, an intervening residential gateway\n
      \  exists between the Device and the access network.  If the residential\n   gateway
      does not provide the appropriate information to the Devices\n   it serves, those
      Devices are unable to discover a LIS.\n   Support of this specification by residential
      gateways ensures that\n   the Devices they serve are able to acquire location
      information.  In\n   many cases, the residential gateway configures the Devices
      it serves\n   using DHCP.  A residential gateway is able to use DHCP to assist\n
      \  Devices in gaining access to their location information.  This can be\n   accomplished
      by providing an access network domain name DHCP option\n   suitable for LIS
      discovery, or by acting as a LIS directly.  To\n   actively assist Devices,
      a residential gateway can either:\n   o  acquire an access network domain name
      from the access network\n      provider (possibly using DHCP) and pass the resulting
      value to\n      Devices; or\n   o  discover a LIS on its external interface,
      then provide Devices\n      with the domain name that was used to successfully
      discover the\n      LIS; or\n   o  explicitly include configuration that refers
      to a particular LIS;\n      or\n   o  act as a LIS and directly provide location
      information to the\n      Devices it serves, including providing a means to
      discover this\n      service.\n   As with Devices, configuration of a specific
      domain name or location\n   information is only accurate as long as the residential
      gateway does\n   not move.  If a residential gateway that relies on configuration\n
      \  rather than automatic discovery is moved, the Devices it serves could\n   be
      provided with inaccurate information.  Devices could be led to\n   discover
      a LIS that is unable to provide accurate location\n   information, or -- if
      location is configured on the residential\n   gateway -- the residential gateway
      could provide incorrect location\n   information.\n"

      over a VPN network interface\n   until it has attempted and failed to perform
      discovery on all other\n   non-VPN interfaces.  A Device MAY perform discovery
      over a VPN\n   network interface if it has first attempted discovery on non-VPN\n
      \  interfaces, but a LIS discovered in this way is unlikely to have the\n   information
      necessary to determine an accurate location.\n   Not all interfaces connected
      to a VPN can be detected by Devices or\n   the software running on them.  In
      these cases, it might be that a LIS\n   on the remote side of a VPN is inadvertently
      discovered.  A LIS\n   provides a \"notLocatable\" error code in response to
      a request that it\n   is unable to fulfill (see [RFC5985], Section 6.3).  This
      ensures that\n   even if a Device discovers a LIS over the VPN, it does not
      rely on a\n   LIS that is unable to provide accurate location information.\n"

      name used in the\n   DHCPv4 option defined in Section 3.2 and also used in the
      DHCPv6\n   option defined in Section 3.3.\n   The domain name is encoded according
      to Section 3.1 of [RFC1035].\n   Each label is represented as a one-octet length
      field followed by\n   that number of octets.  Since every domain name ends with
      the null\n   label of the root, a domain name is terminated by a length byte
      of\n   zero.  The high-order two bits of every length octet MUST be zero,\n
      \  and the remaining six bits of the length field limit the label to 63\n   octets
      or less.  To simplify implementations, the total length of a\n   domain name
      (i.e., label octets and label length octets) is\n   restricted to 255 octets
      or less.\n   For example, the domain \"example.com.\" is encoded in 13 octets

      label.\n"

    - "3.4.  Alternative Domain Names\n   The U-NAPTR resolution method described
      requires a domain name as\n   input.  The access network domain name DHCP options
      (Sections 3.2 and\n   3.3) are one source of this domain name.\n   If a Device
      knows one or more alternative domain names that might be\n   used for discovery,
      it MAY repeat the U-NAPTR process using those\n   domain names as input.  For
      instance, static configuration of a\n   Device might be used to provide a Device
      with a domain name.\n   DHCPv4 option 15 [RFC2132] provides an indication of
      the domain name\n   that a host uses when resolving hostnames in DNS.  This
      option is\n   used when the DHCPv4 access domain name is not available.\n   DHCPv4
      option 15 might not be suitable for some network deployments.\n   For instance,
      a global enterprise could operate multiple sites, with\n   Devices at all sites
      using the same value for option 15.  In this\n   type of deployment, it might
      be desirable to discover a LIS local to\n   a site.  The access domain name
      option can be given a different value\n   at each site to enable discovery of
      a LIS at that site.\n   Alternative domain names MUST NOT be used unless the
      access network\n   domain name option is unsuccessful or where external information\n
      \  indicates that a particular domain name is to be used.\n   Other domain names
      might be provided by a DHCP server (for example,\n   [RFC4702] for DHCPv4, [RFC4704]
      for DHCPv6).  However, these domain\n   names could be provided without considering
      their use for LIS\n   discovery; therefore, it is not likely that these other
      domain names\n   contain useful values.\n"

  - "4.  U-NAPTR Resolution of a LIS URI\n   U-NAPTR [RFC4848] resolution for a LIS
    takes a domain name as input\n   and produces a URI that identifies the LIS.  This
    process also\n   requires an Application Service tag and an Application Protocol
    tag,\n   which differentiate LIS-related NAPTR records from other records for\n
    \  that domain.\n   Section 6.2 defines an Application Service tag of \"LIS\",
    which is\n   used to identify the location service for a given domain.  The\n
    \  Application Protocol tag \"HELD\", defined in Section 6.3, is used to\n   identify
    a LIS that understands the HELD protocol [RFC5985].\n   The NAPTR records in the
    following example demonstrate the use of the\n   Application Service and Protocol
    tags.  Iterative NAPTR resolution is\n   used to delegate responsibility for the
    LIS service from\n   \"zonea.example.net.\" and \"zoneb.example.net.\" to\n   \"outsource.example.com.\".\n

    tag are included in Section 6.\n   U-NAPTR resolution might produce multiple results
    from each iteration\n   of the algorithm.  Order and preference values in the
    NAPTR record\n   determine which value is chosen.  A Device MAY attempt to use\n
    \  alternative choices if the first choice is not successful.  However,\n   if
    a request to the resulting URI produces a HELD \"notLocatable\"\n   response,
    or equivalent, the Device SHOULD NOT attempt to use any\n   alternative choices
    from the same domain name.\n   An HTTPS LIS URI that is a product of U-NAPTR MUST
    be authenticated\n   using the domain name method described in Section 3.1 of
    RFC 2818\n   [RFC2818].  The domain name that is used in this authentication is\n
    \  the one extracted from the URI, not the one that was input to the\n   U-NAPTR
    resolution process.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The address of a LIS is usually well-known within
    an access network;\n   therefore, interception of messages does not introduce
    any specific\n   concerns.\n   The primary attack against the methods described
    in this document is\n   one that would lead to impersonation of a LIS.  The LIS
    is\n   responsible for providing location information, and this information\n
    \  is critical to a number of network services; furthermore, a Device\n   does
    not necessarily have a prior relationship with a LIS.  Several\n   methods are
    described here that can limit the probability of, or\n   provide some protection
    against, such an attack.  These methods MUST\n   be applied unless similar protections
    are in place, or in cases --\n   such as an emergency -- where location information
    of dubious origin\n   is arguably better than none at all.\n   An attacker could
    attempt to compromise LIS discovery at any of three\n   stages:\n   1.  providing
    a falsified domain name to be used as input to U-NAPTR\n   2.  altering the DNS
    records used in U-NAPTR resolution\n   3.  impersonating the LIS\n   The domain
    name that used to authenticate the LIS is the domain name\n   input to the U-NAPTR
    process, not the output of that process\n   [RFC3958], [RFC4848].  As a result,
    the results of DNS queries do not\n   need integrity protection.\n   An HTTPS
    URI is authenticated using the method described in Section\n   3.1 of [RFC2818].
    \ HTTP client implementations frequently do not\n   provide a means to authenticate
    based on a domain name other than the\n   one indicated in the request URI, namely
    the U-NAPTR output.  To\n   avoid having to authenticate the LIS with a domain
    name that is\n   different from the one used to identify it, a client MAY choose
    to\n   reject URIs that contain a domain name that is different to the\n   U-NAPTR
    input.  To support endpoints that enforce the above\n   restriction on URIs, network
    administrators SHOULD ensure that the\n   domain name in the DHCP option is the
    same as the one contained in\n   the resulting URI.\n   Authentication of a LIS
    relies on the integrity of the domain name\n   acquired from DHCP.  An attacker
    that is able to falsify a domain\n   name circumvents the protections provided.
    \ To ensure that the access\n   network domain name DHCP option can be relied
    upon, preventing DHCP\n   messages from being modified or spoofed by attackers
    is necessary.\n   Physical- or link-layer security are commonly used to reduce
    the\n   possibility of such an attack within an access network.  DHCP\n   authentication
    [RFC3118] might also provide a degree of protection\n   against modification or
    spoofing.\n   A LIS that is identified by an HTTP URI cannot be authenticated.
    \ Use\n   of unsecured HTTP also does not meet requirements in HELD for\n   confidentiality
    and integrity.  If an HTTP URI is the product of LIS\n   discovery, this leaves
    Devices vulnerable to several attacks.  Lower-\n   layer protections, such as
    Layer 2 traffic separation might be used\n   to provide some guarantees.\n"
