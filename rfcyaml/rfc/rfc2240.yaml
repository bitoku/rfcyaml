- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The purpose of this memo is to focus discussion on the particular\n\
    \   problems with the exhaustion of the top level domain space in the\n   Internet\
    \ and the possible conflicts that can occur when multiple\n   organisations are\
    \ vying for the same name. No proposed solutions in\n   this document are intended\
    \ as standards for the Internet. Rather, it\n   is hoped that a general consensus\
    \ will emerge as to the appropriate\n   solution to such problems, leading eventually\
    \ to the adoption of\n   standards.\n"
- title: 2.  Overview of the domain space
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview of the domain space\n   Presently the domain space is organised\
    \ as a heirarchical tree-\n   structured namespace with several top level domains\
    \ (TLDs), and sub-\n   domains beneath them. The initial TLDs allocated and rationale\
    \ are\n   documented in [1].\n   The TLDs are functionally split up into 'generic'\
    \ top-level domains\n   (gTLDs) and two-letter ISO 3166 country domains for every\
    \ country in\n   which Internet connectivity is provided. The allocation of sub-\n\
    \   domains under these TLDs is entirely up to the registry for that TLD.\n  \
    \ The registry may decide to allocate further levels of structure or\n   merely\
    \ allocate domains in a 'flat' manner.\n   Example:\n           +-----+      \
    \   +----+                       +----+\n           | COM |         | UK |   \

    \  +----+       +-----+\n    1. Flat gTLD     2. Heirarchical country      3.\
    \ Flat country\n   In the example we see that the gTLDs are inherently flat, as\n\
    \   organisations are allocated domain names directly under the TLD.\n   With\
    \ the country domains however, the domain allocation policy can\n   vary widely\
    \ from country to country, and it does. Some may choose to\n   implement a functional\
    \ sub-structure mirroring the gTLDs, some may\n   choose to implement a geographical\
    \ sub-structure, and some may choose\n   to have no sub-structure at all.\n  \
    \ In the first case the organisation is clearly a commercial one, as it\n   is\
    \ allocatged under the \"COM\" TLD. However, there is no information\n   as to\
    \ the country the organisation is based in.  In the third case,\n   we know that\
    \ the organisation is based in France (FR), but without\n   studying the actual\
    \ organisation name we do not know what type of\n   organisation it is.  In the\
    \ second case, we know the country that\n   both organisations are based in (UK),\
    \ and by following the heirarchy,\n   we can deduce that the first is an academic\
    \ organisation (AC), and\n   the second is commercial (CO).\n   While the system\
    \ is flexible in not enforcing a strict heirarchy, it\n   can lead to exhaustion\
    \ of domain names in the generic space and lead\n   to conflicts between organisations\
    \ who may both have a legitimate\n   claim to have a particular name.\n"
- title: 3.  Possible solutions to name exhaustion
  contents:
  - "3.  Possible solutions to name exhaustion\n   With such a flexible system, there\
    \ are many ways of preventing the\n   name space being exhausted. A solution proposed\
    \ by [2] is to create\n   more gTLDs to allow organisations with the same name\
    \ to be registered\n   uniquely under different TLDs (FIRM, STORE, WEB, ARTS,\
    \ REC, INFO and\n   NOM). However this has several disadvantages as discussed\
    \ below:\n   a) It creates confusion in users mind as to what TLD refers to a\n\
    \      particular organisation. For example, MCDONALDS.COM maybe the fast\n  \
    \    food corporation and MCDONALDS.FIRM maybe a firm of lawyers, but\n      how\
    \ is the user supposed to know which is which?\n   b) To prevent the above confusion,\
    \ big corporations will simply\n      reserve all the different variations of\
    \ the name, ie. IBM.COM,\n      IBM.FIRM, IBM.STORE etc. Thus we haven't solved\
    \ the name\n      exhaustion or conflict problems, in fact we have made it worse.\n\
    \   c) Names of legitimate trade mark holders or other legally held names\n  \
    \    can still be acquired by anybody, leading to potential conflicts.\n"
- title: 4.  Proposed creation of new SLDs
  contents:
  - "4.  Proposed creation of new SLDs\n   With the aforementioned problems in mind,\
    \ it is not a good idea to\n   create new gTLDs which merely overlap the existing\
    \ ones. As the\n   domain name system is heirarchical it would seem a good idea\
    \ to\n   expand on the existing structure rather than creating several\n   duplicate\
    \ structures.\n"
- title: 4.1 The world is not flat so why should domains be?
  contents:
  - "4.1 The world is not flat so why should domains be?\n   With the expansion of\
    \ the Internet to a truly global medium, the\n   notion that there can only be\
    \ one commercial entity, one orgnisation,\n   and one network provider etc. with\
    \ the same name seems impossible.\n   This is the situation that the present system\
    \ finds itself in.  There\n   is a constantly spiralling number of disputes over\
    \ who 'owns' or '\n   deserves' a certain name, with an increasing number ending\
    \ in\n   unnecessary and costly legal action. This is not something that the\n\
    \   providers of a domain name service should concern themselves with,\n   but\
    \ yet with the present system, this seems inevitable.\n"
- title: 4.2 The case for legal names
  contents:
  - "4.2 The case for legal names\n   This proposal allows for country domain names\
    \ that are related to\n   legally registered names in the country that they are\
    \ based by\n   creating a functional heirarchy beneath the country TLD.\n   This\
    \ proposal does not seek to do away with gTLDs, but rather that a\n   legal name\
    \ should be sought first and then, if desired, a generic\n   name could be used\
    \ alongside it. The organisation would then, in case\n   of any disputes, have\
    \ a legally-held name which no other organisation\n   could have any claim to.\n\
    \   This proposal has several advantages:\n   a) The process of deciding what\
    \ names belong to which organisation\n      is no longer a function of the domain\
    \ name registry, but of the\n      company registration authority in the given\
    \ country. This means\n      that disputes over names cannot arise as all names\
    \ are unique\n      within the context of the legal company title.\n   b) As all\
    \ names are unique, there should be no exhaustion\n      (deliberately or otherwise)\
    \ of 'desirable' names by other\n      concerns, as all the owners of legally-held\
    \ company names will\n      automatically have the right to the relevant domain\
    \ name.\n"
- title: 4.3 Allocation of legal SLDs
  contents:
  - "4.3 Allocation of legal SLDs\n   The second level domain identifiers should be\
    \ created from the\n   existing company indentifiers within the given country.\
    \  For example:\n     LTD.UK   for limited companies in the UK\n     PLC.UK  \
    \ for public companies in the UK\n     INC.US   for incorpated bodies in the US\n\
    \     CORP.US  for corporations in the US\n     GMBH.DE  for German companies\n\
    \   The registries for the appropriate top-level country domain should\n   create\
    \ and manage the sub-domains based on the laws for allocating\n   company names\
    \ in that particular country.  Specifically, ALL spaces\n   should be converted\
    \ to hyphens '-' and other punctuation either\n   disregarded or also converted\
    \ into hyphens.\n   For holders of international trademarks and other international\n\
    \   names, the gTLD \"INT\" can be used in place of the country identifier.\n\
    \   For example:\n     TM.INT  } for international trademarks\n     REG.INT }\n"
- title: 4.4 Allocation of miscellaneous SLDs
  contents:
  - "4.4 Allocation of miscellaneous SLDs\n   In countries that do not have existing\
    \ sub-structure it is strongly\n   recommended that along with the creation of\
    \ legal SLDs described\n   here, that other SLDs be created for commercial entities,\n\
    \   organisations, and academic entities to reduce remaining conflicts\n   from\
    \ organisations that are not legally-registered companies.\n   For example:\n\
    \                  +------------------+\n                  | ISO 3166 country\
    \ | . . . . . . . . .\n                  +------------------+        .       \
    \ .\n                   |       |        |         .        .\n              \
    \ +-----+  +-----+  +-----+   +-----+  +-----+\n               | AC/ |  | CO/\
    \ |  | OR/ |   | LTD |  | INC |\n               | EDU |  | COM |  | ORG |   +-----+\
