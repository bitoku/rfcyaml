  - "1.  Introduction\n   In their \"Report from the IAB Workshop on Unwanted Traffic\
    \ March\n   9-10, 2006\" [RFC4948], the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)\n  \
    \ described an attack on core routing infrastructure as an ideal attack\n   that\
    \ would inflict the greatest amount of damage and suggested steps\n   to tighten\
    \ the infrastructure against the attack.  Four main steps\n   were identified\
    \ for that tightening:\n   1.  Create secure mechanisms and practices for operating\
    \ routers.\n   2.  Clean up the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) repository, and\n\
    \       secure both the database and the access, so that it can be used\n    \
    \   for routing verifications.\n   3.  Create specifications for cryptographic\
    \ validation of routing\n       message content.\n   4.  Secure the routing protocols'\
    \ packets on the wire.\n   In order to secure the routing protocols, this document\
    \ performs an\n   initial analysis of the current state of four TCP-based protocols\
    \ --\n   BGP [RFC4271], LDP [RFC5036], PCEP [RFC5440], and MSDP [RFC3618] --\n\
    \   according to the requirements of the KARP Design Guidelines\n   [RFC6518].\
    \  Section 4.2 of that document uses the term \"state\", which\n   will be referred\
    \ to as the \"state of the security method\".  Thus, a\n   term like \"Define\
    \ Optimal State\" would be referred to as \"Define\n   Optimal State of the Security\
    \ Method\".\n   This document builds on several previous efforts into routing\n\
    \   security:\n   o  \"Issues with Existing Cryptographic Protection Methods for\
    \ Routing\n      Protocols\" [RFC6039], describes issues with existing cryptographic\n\
    \      protection methods for routing protocols.\n   o  Analysis of OSPF Security\
    \ According to the KARP Design Guide\n      [RFC6863] analyzes Open Shortest Path\
    \ First (OSPF) security\n      according to the KARP Design Guide.\n   Section\
    \ 2 of this document looks at the current state of the security\n   method for\
    \ the four routing protocols: BGP, LDP, PCEP, and MSDP.\n   Section 3 examines\
    \ what the optimal state of the security method\n   would be for the four routing\
    \ protocols according to the KARP Design\n   Guidelines [RFC6518], and Section\
    \ 4 does an analysis of the gap\n   between the existing state of the security\
    \ method and the optimal\n   state of the security method for the protocols and\
    \ suggests some\n   areas where improvement is needed.\n"

    \ the transport protocols for any authentication\n   or integrity mechanisms used\

    \ used by BGP, LDP, PCEP, and\n   MSDP.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Transport Layer
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Transport Layer\n   At the transport layer, routing protocols are subject\
    \ to a variety of\n   DoS attacks, as outlined in \"Internet Denial-of-Service\n\
    \   Considerations\" [RFC4732].  Such attacks can cause the routing\n   protocol\
    \ to become congested, resulting in the routing updates being\n   supplied too\
    \ slowly to be useful.  In extreme cases, these attacks\n   prevent routers from\
    \ converging after a change.\n   Routing protocols use several methods to protect\
    \ themselves.  Those\n   that use TCP as a transport protocol use access lists\
    \ to accept\n   packets only from known sources.  These access lists also help\n\
    \   protect edge routers from attacks originating outside the protected\n   domain.\
    \  In addition, for edge routers running the External Border\n   Gateway Protocol\
    \ (eBGP), TCP LISTEN is run only on interfaces on\n   which its peers have been\
    \ discovered or via which routing sessions\n   are expected (as specified in router\
    \ configuration databases).\n   \"Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)\"\
    \ [RFC5082] describes a\n   generalized Time-to-Live (TTL) security mechanism\
    \ to protect a\n   protocol stack from CPU-utilization-based attacks.  TCP Robustness\n\
    \   [RFC5961] recommends some TCP-level mitigations against spoofing\n   attacks\
    \ targeted towards long-lived routing protocol sessions.\n   Even when BGP, LDP,\
    \ PCEP, and MSDP sessions use access lists, they\n   are vulnerable to spoofing\
    \ and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n   Authentication and integrity checks allow\
    \ the receiver of a routing\n   protocol update to know that the message genuinely\
    \ comes from the\n   node that claims to have sent it and to know whether the\
    \ message has\n   been modified.  Sometimes routers can be subjected to a large\
    \ number\n   of authentication and integrity requests, exhausting connection\n\
    \   resources on the router in a way that could lead to the denial of\n   genuine\
    \ requests.\n   TCP MD5 [RFC2385] has been obsoleted by TCP-AO [RFC5925].  However,\n\
    \   it is still widely used to authenticate TCP-based routing protocols\n   such\
    \ as BGP.  It provides a way for carrying a MD5 digest in a TCP\n   segment. \
    \ This digest is computed using information known only to the\n   endpoints, and\
    \ this ensures authenticity and integrity of messages.\n   The MD5 key used to\
    \ compute the digest is stored locally on the\n   router.  This option is used\
    \ by routing protocols to provide for\n   session-level protection against the\
    \ introduction of spoofed TCP\n   segments into any existing TCP streams, in particular,\
    \ TCP Reset\n   segments.  TCP MD5 does not provide a generic mechanism to support\n\
    \   key rollover.  It also does not support algorithm agility.\n   The Message\
    \ Authentication Codes (MACs) used by TCP MD5 are\n   considered too weak both\
    \ because of the use of the hash function and\n   because of the way the secret\
    \ key used by TCP MD5 is managed.\n   Furthermore, TCP MD5 does not support any\
    \ algorithm agility.  TCP-AO\n   [RFC5925] and its companion document Cryptographic\
    \ Algorithms for\n   TCP-AO [RFC5926], describe steps towards correcting both\
    \ the MAC\n   weakness and the management of secret keys.  Those steps require\
    \ that\n   two MAC algorithms be supported.  They are HMAC-SHA-1-96, as\n   specified\
    \ in HMAC [RFC2104], and AES-128-CMAC-96, as specified in\n   NIST-SP800-38B [NIST-SP800-38B].\
    \  Cryptographic research suggests\n   that both these MAC algorithms are fairly\
    \ secure.  By supporting\n   multiple MAC algorithms, TCP-AO supports algorithm\
    \ agility.  TCP-AO\n   also allows additional MACs to be added in the future.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Keying Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Keying Mechanisms\n   For TCP-AO [RFC5925], there is no Key Management\
    \ Protocol (KMP) used\n   to manage the keys that are employed to generate the\
    \ MAC.  TCP-AO\n   talks about coordinating keys derived from the Master Key Table\
    \ (MKT)\n   between endpoints and allows for a master key to be configured\n \
    \  manually or for it to be managed via an out-of-band mechanism.\n   It should\
    \ be noted that most routers configured with static keys have\n   not seen the\
    \ key changed ever.  The common reason given for not\n   changing the key is the\
    \ difficulty in coordinating the change between\n   pairs of routers when using\
    \ TCP MD5.  It is well known that the\n   longer the same key is used, the greater\
    \ the chance that it can be\n   guessed or exposed, e.g., when an administrator\
    \ with knowledge of the\n   keys leaves the company.\n   For point-to-point key\
    \ management, the IKEv2 protocol [RFC5996]\n   provides for automated key exchange\
    \ under a Security Association (SA)\n   and can be used for a comprehensive KMP\
    \ solution for routers.  IKEv2\n   can be used for both IPsec SAs [RFC4301] and\
    \ other types of SAs.  For\n   example, Fibre Channel SAs [RFC4595] are currently\
    \ negotiated with\n   IKEv2.  Using IKEv2 to negotiate TCP-AO is a possible option.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.  BGP\n   All BGP communications take place over TCP.  Therefore, all security\n\
    \   vulnerabilities for BGP can be categorized as relating to the\n   security\
    \ of the transport protocol itself, or to the compromising of\n   individual routers\
    \ and the data they handle.  This document examines\n   the issues for the transport\
    \ protocol, while the SIDR Working Group\n   (WG) looks at ways to sign and secure\
    \ the data exchanged in BGP as\n   described in \"An Infrastructure to Support\
    \ Secure Internet Protocol\"\n   [RFC6480].\n"

    \ mechanism for detection and reporting.\n   Section 5 of LDP [RFC5036] states\
    \ that LDP is subject to two\n   different types of attacks: spoofing and denial-of-service\
    \ attacks.\n"

    \ the discovery\n   phase and during the session communication phase.\n"
- title: 2.4.1.1.  Discovery Exchanges using UDP
  contents:
  - "2.4.1.1.  Discovery Exchanges using UDP\n   Label Switching Routers (LSRs) indicate\
    \ their willingness to\n   establish and maintain LDP sessions by periodically\
    \ sending Hello\n   messages.  Reception of a Hello message serves to create a\
    \ new \"Hello\n   adjacency\", if one does not already exist, or to refresh an\
    \ existing\n   one.\n   There are two variants of the discovery mechanism.  A\
    \ Basic Discovery\n   mechanism is used to discover LSR neighbors that are directly\n\
    \   connected at the link level, and an Extended Discovery mechanism is\n   used\
    \ by LSRs that are more than one hop away.\n   Unlike all other LDP messages,\
    \ the Hello messages are sent using UDP.\n   This means that they cannot benefit\
    \ from the security mechanisms\n   available with TCP.  LDP [RFC5036] does not\
    \ provide any security\n   mechanisms for use with Hello messages except for some\
    \ configuration\n   that may help protect against bogus discovery events.  These\n\
    \   configurations include directly connected links and interfaces.\n   Routers\
    \ that do not use directly connected links have to use the\n   Extended Discovery\
    \ mechanism and will not be able to use\n   configuration to protect against bogus\
    \ discovery events.\n   Spoofing a Hello packet for an existing adjacency can\
    \ cause the\n   adjacency to time out and result in termination of the associated\n\
    \   session.  This can occur when the spoofed Hello message specifies a\n   small\
    \ Hold Time, causing the receiver to expect Hello messages within\n   this interval,\
    \ while the true neighbor continues sending Hello\n   messages at the lower, previously\
    \ agreed to frequency.\n   Spoofing a Hello packet can also cause the LDP session\
    \ to be\n   terminated.  This can occur when the spoofed Hello specifies a\n \
    \  different Transport Address from the previously agreed one between\n   neighbors.\
    \  Spoofed Hello messages are observed and reported as a\n   real problem in production\
    \ networks.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.1.2.  Session Communication using TCP\n   LDP, like other TCP-based routing\

    \ the authenticity and integrity of\n   session messages.  As stated in Section\
    \ 2.1 of this document and in\n   Section 2.9 of LDP [RFC5036], MD5 authentication\
    \ is considered too\n   weak for this application as outlined in MD5 and HMAC-MD5\
    \ Security\n   Considerations [RFC6151].  It also does not support algorithm\n\
    \   agility.  A stronger hashing algorithm, e.g., SHA1, which is\n   supported\
    \ by TCP-AO [RFC5925], could be deployed to take care of the\n   weakness.\n \
    \  Alternatively, one could move to using TCP-AO, which provides for\n   stronger\

- title: 2.5.  PCEP
  contents:
  - "2.5.  PCEP\n   For effective selection by Path Computation Clients (PCCs), a\
    \ PCC\n   needs to know the location of Path Computation Elements (PCEs) in its\n\
    \   domain along with some information relevant for PCE selection.  Such\n   PCE\
    \ information could be learned through manual configuration, on\n   each PCC,\
    \ along with the capabilities of the PCE or automatically\n   through a PCE discovery\
    \ mechanism as outlined in Requirements for PCE\n   Discovery [RFC4674].\n   Attacks\
    \ on PCEP [RFC5440] may result in damage to active networks.\n   These include\
    \ computation responses, which if changed can cause\n   protocols like RSVP-TE\
    \ [RFC3209] to set up suboptimal or\n   inappropriate LSPs.  In addition, PCE\
    \ itself can be a target for a\n   variety of DoS attacks.  Such attacks can cause\
    \ path computations to\n   be supplied too slowly to be of any value, particularly\
    \ as it relates\n   to recovery or establishment of LSPs.\n   Finally, PCE discovery,\
    \ as outlined in OSPF Protocol Extensions for\n   PCE Discovery [RFC5088] and\
    \ IS-IS Protocol Extensions for PCE\n   Discovery [RFC5089], is a significant\
    \ feature for the successful\n   deployment of PCEP in large networks.  These\
    \ mechanisms allow PCC to\n   discover the existence of PCEs within the network.\
    \  If the discovery\n   mechanism is compromised, it will impair the ability of\
    \ the nodes to\n   function as described below.\n   As RFC 5440 states, PCEP (which\
    \ makes use of TCP as a transport)\n   could be the target of the following attacks:\n\
    \   o  Spoofing (PCC or PCE implementation)\n   o  Snooping (message interception)\n\
    \   o  Falsification\n   o  Denial of Service\n   In inter-Autonomous System (inter-AS)\
    \ scenarios where PCE-to-PCE\n   communication is required, attacks may be particularly\
    \ significant\n   with commercial implications as well as service-level agreement\n\
    \   implications.\n   Additionally, snooping of PCEP requests and responses may\
    \ give an\n   attacker information about the operation of the network.  By viewing\n\
    \   the PCEP messages, an attacker can determine the pattern of service\n   establishment\
    \ in the network and can know where traffic is being\n   routed, thereby making\
    \ the network susceptible to targeted attacks\n   and the data within specific\
    \ LSPs vulnerable.\n   Ensuring PCEP communication privacy is of key importance,\
    \ especially\n   in an inter-AS context, where PCEP communication endpoints do\
    \ not\n   reside in the same AS.  An attacker that intercepts a PCE message\n\
    \   could obtain sensitive information related to computed paths and\n   resources.\n\
    \   At the time PCEP was documented in [RFC5440], TCP-AO had not been\n   fully\
    \ specified.  Therefore, [RFC5440] mandates that PCEP\n   implementations include\
    \ support for TCP MD5 and that use of the\n   function should be configurable\
    \ by the operator.  [RFC5440] also\n   describes the vulnerabilities and weaknesses\
    \ of TCP MD5 as noted in\n   this document.  [RFC5440] goes on to state that PCEP\
    \ implementations\n   should include support for TCP-AO as soon as that specification\
    \ is\n   complete.  Since TCP-AO [RFC5925] has now been published, new PCEP\n\
    \   implementations should fully support TCP-AO.\n"
- title: 2.6.  MSDP
  contents:
  - "2.6.  MSDP\n   Similar to BGP and LDP, the Multicast Source Distribution Protocol\n\
    \   (MSDP) uses TCP MD5 [RFC2385] to protect TCP sessions via the TCP MD5\n  \
    \ option.  But with a weak MD5 authentication, TCP MD5 is not\n   considered strong\
    \ enough for this application.  It also does not\n   support algorithm agility.\n\
    \   MSDP advocates imposing a limit on the number of source address and\n   group\

    \   needs to be upgraded such that an implementation is able to determine\n  \
    \ the authenticity of the neighbors sending the Hello message.\n   Labels are\
    \ similar to routing information, which is distributed in\n   the clear.  However,\
    \ there is currently no requirement that the\n   labels be encrypted.  Such a\
    \ requirement is out of scope for this\n   document.\n   Similarly, it is important\

    \ that there are no rogue peers or\n   unauthenticated peers that can compromise\
    \ the stability of the\n   network.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Gap Analysis for BGP, LDP, PCEP, and MSDP\n   This section outlines the differences\
    \ between the current state of\n   the security methods for routing protocols\
    \ and the desired state of\n   the security methods as outlined in Section 4.2\
    \ of the KARP Design\n   Guidelines [RFC6518].  As that document states, these\
    \ routing\n   protocols fall into the category of one-to-one peering messages\
    \ and\n   will use peer keying protocols.  This section covers issues that are\n\
    \   common to the four protocols, leaving protocol-specific issues to\n   sub-sections.\n\
    \   At a transport level, these routing protocols are subject to some of\n   the\
    \ same attacks that TCP applications are subject to.  These include\n   DoS and\
    \ spoofing attacks.  \"Internet Denial-of-Service\n   Considerations\" [RFC4732]\
    \ outlines some solutions.  \"Defending TCP\n   Against Spoofing Attacks\" [RFC4953]\
    \ recommends ways to prevent\n   spoofing attacks.  In addition, the recommendations\
    \ in [RFC5961]\n   should also be followed and implemented to strengthen TCP.\n\
    \   Routers lack comprehensive key management and keys derived that they\n   can\
    \ use to authenticate data.  As an example, TCP-AO [RFC5925], talks\n   about\
    \ coordinating keys derived from the Master Key Table (MKT)\n   between endpoints,\
    \ but the MKT itself has to be configured manually\n   or through an out-of-band\
    \ mechanism.  Also, TCP-AO does not address\n   the issue of connectionless reset,\
    \ as it applies to routers that do\n   not store MKT across reboots.\n   Authentication,\
    \ integrity protection, and encryption all require the\n   use of keys by sender\
    \ and receiver.  An automated KMP, therefore has\n   to include a way to distribute\
    \ key material between two endpoints\n   with little or no administrative overhead.\
    \  It has to cover automatic\n   key rollover.  It is expected that authentication\
    \ will cover the\n   packet, i.e., the payload and the TCP header, and will not\
    \ cover the\n   frame, i.e., the layer 2 header.\n   There are two methods of\
    \ automatic key rollover.  Implicit key\n   rollover can be initiated after a\
    \ certain volume of data gets\n   exchanged or when a certain time has elapsed.\
    \  This does not require\n   explicit signaling nor should it result in a reset\
    \ of the TCP\n   connection in a way that the links/adjacencies are affected.\
    \  On the\n   other hand, explicit key rollover requires an out-of-band key\n\
    \   signaling mechanism.  It can be triggered by either side and can be\n   done\
    \ anytime a security parameter changes, e.g., an attack has\n   happened, or a\
    \ system administrator with access to the keys has left\n   the company.  An example\
    \ of this is IKEv2 [RFC5996], but it could be\n   any other new mechanisms also.\n\
    \   As stated earlier, TCP-AO [RFC5925] and its accompanying document,\n   Cryptographic\
    \ Algorithms for TCP-AO [RFC5926], require that two MAC\n   algorithms be supported,\
    \ and they are HMAC-SHA-1-96, as specified in\n   HMAC [RFC2104], and AES-128-CMAC-96,\
    \ as specified in NIST-SP800-38B\n   [NIST-SP800-38B].  Therefore, TCP-AO meets\
    \ the algorithm agility\n   requirement.\n   There is a need to protect authenticity\
    \ and validity of the routing/\n   label information that is carried in the payload\
    \ of the sessions.\n   However, that is outside the scope of this document and\
    \ is being\n   addressed by the SIDR WG.  Similar mechanisms could be used for\n\
    \   intra-domain protocols.\n   Finally, replay protection is required.  The replay\
    \ mechanism needs\n   to be sufficient to prevent an attacker from creating a\
    \ denial of\n   service or disrupting the integrity of the routing protocol by\n\
    \   replaying packets.  It is important that an attacker not be able to\n   disrupt\
    \ service by capturing packets and waiting for replay state to\n   be lost.\n"
- title: 4.1.  LDP
  contents:
  - "4.1.  LDP\n   As described in LDP [RFC5036], the threat of spoofed Basic Hellos\
    \ can\n   be reduced by only accepting Basic Hellos on interfaces that LSRs\n\
    \   trust, employing GTSM [RFC5082], and ignoring Basic Hellos not\n   addressed\
    \ to the \"all routers on this subnet\" multicast group.\n   Spoofing attacks\
    \ via Targeted Hellos are potentially a more serious\n   threat.  An LSR can reduce\
    \ the threat of spoofed Extended Hellos by\n   filtering them and accepting Hellos\
    \ from sources permitted by access\n   lists.  However, performing the filtering\
    \ using access lists requires\n   LSR resources, and the LSR is still vulnerable\
    \ to the IP source\n   address spoofing.  Spoofing attacks can be solved by being\
    \ able to\n   authenticate the Hello messages, and an LSR can be configured to\
    \ only\n   accept Hello messages from specific peers when authentication is in\n\
    \   use.\n   LDP Hello Cryptographic Authentication [HELLO-CRYPTO] suggest a new\n\
    \   Cryptographic Authentication TLV that can be used as an\n   authentication\
    \ mechanism to secure Hello messages.\n"
- title: 4.2.  PCEP
  contents:
  - "4.2.  PCEP\n   Path Computation Element (PCE) discovery, according to [RFC5440],\
    \ is\n   a significant feature for the successful deployment of PCEP in large\n\
    \   networks.  This mechanism allows a Path Computation Client (PCC) to\n   discover\
    \ the existence of suitable PCEs within the network without\n   the necessity\
    \ of configuration.  It should be obvious that, where\n   PCEs are discovered\
    \ and not configured, the PCC cannot know the\n   correct key to use.  There are\
    \ different approaches to retain some\n   aspect of security, but all of them\
    \ require use of a keys and a\n   keying mechanism, the need for which has been\
    \ discussed above.\n"
- title: 5.  Transition and Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Transition and Deployment Considerations\n   As stated in the KARP Design\
    \ Guidelines [RFC6518], it is imperative\n   that the new authentication, security\
    \ mechanisms, and key management\n   protocol support incremental deployment,\
    \ as it is not feasible to\n   deploy the new routing protocol authentication\
    \ mechanism overnight.\n   Typically, authentication and security in a peer-to-peer\
    \ protocol\n   requires that both parties agree to the mechanisms that will be\
    \ used.\n   If an agreement is not reached, the setup of the new mechanism will\n\
    \   fail or will be deferred.  Upon failure, the routing protocols can\n   fall\
    \ back to the mechanisms that were already in place, e.g., use\n   static keys\
    \ if that was the mechanism in place.  The fallback should\n   be configurable\
    \ on a per-node or per-interface basis.  It is usually\n   not possible for one\
    \ end to use the new mechanism while the other end\n   uses the old.  Policies\
    \ can be put in place to retry upgrading after\n   a said period of time, so that\
    \ manual coordination is not required.\n   If the automatic KMP requires use of\
    \ Public Key Infrastructure\n   Certificates [RFC5280] to exchange key material,\
    \ the required\n   Certificate Authority (CA) root certificates may need to be\
    \ installed\n   to verify the authenticity of requests initiated by a peer.  Such\
    \ a\n   step does not require coordination with the peer, except to decide\n \
    \  which CA authority will be used.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This section describes security considerations\
    \ that BGP, LDP, PCEP,\n   and MSDP should try to meet.\n   As with all routing\
    \ protocols, they need protection from both on-path\n   and off-path blind attacks.\
    \  A better way to protect them would be\n   with per-packet protection using\
    \ a cryptographic MAC.  In order to\n   provide for the MAC, keys are needed.\n\
    \   The routing protocols need to support algorithm agility, i.e., they\n   must\
    \ not hardwire themselves to one algorithm.\n   Once keys are used, mechanisms\
    \ are required to support key rollover.\n   They should cover both manual and\
    \ automatic key rollover.  Multiple\n   approaches could be used.  However, since\
    \ the existing mechanisms\n   provide a protocol field to identify the key as\
    \ well as management\n   mechanisms to introduce and retire new keys, focusing\
    \ on the existing\n   mechanism as a starting point is prudent.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ it is strongly suggested that these routing protocols\n   support algorithm\
    \ agility.  It has been proven that algorithms weaken\n   over time.  Supporting\
    \ algorithm agility assists in smooth\n   transitions from old to new algorithms.\n"
