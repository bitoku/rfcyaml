    \   Date: September 8, 2023 08:47.01 MT\n   Subject:  Hello from the Exobiology\
    \ Lab!\n   Hi Jonathan!\n   I just wanted to let you know that I have settled\
    \ in my new\n   offices at the Exobiology Lab at the Interplanetary Space\n  \
    \ Exploration Agency's base here on Mars. The trip out was\n   uneventful and\
    \ did let me get through an awful lot of\n   reading in preparation for my three\
    \ year term here. There\n   is an excellent library of material here at the lab\
    \ and\n   reasonable communications back home, thanks to the CommRing\n   satellites\
    \ that were put up last year here. The transfer\n   rates are only a few terabits\
    \ per second, but this is\n   usually adequate for the most part.\n   We've been\
    \ doing some simulation work to test various\n   theories of bio-history on Mars\
    \ and I have attached the\n   output of one of the more interesting runs. The\
    \ results are\n   best viewed with a model VR-95HR/OS headset with the\n   peripheral\
    \ glove adapter. I would recommend finding an\n   outdoor location if you activate\
    \ the olfactory simulator\n   since some of the outputs are pretty rank! You'll\
    \ notice\n   that atmospheric outgassing seriously interfered with any\n   potential\
    \ complex life form development.\n   We tried a few runs to see what would happen\
    \ if an\n   atmospheric confinement/replenishment system had been in\n   place,\
    \ but the results are too speculative to be more than\n   entertaining at this\
    \ point. There has been some serious\n   discussion of terra-forming options,\
    \ but the economics are\n   still very unclear, as are the time-frames for realizing\n\
    \   any useful results.\n   I have also been trying out some new exercises to\
    \ recover\n   from the effects of the long trip out. I've attached a\n   sample\
    \ neuroscan clip which will give you some feeling for\n   the kinds of gymnastics\
    \ that are possible in this gravity\n   field. My timing is still pretty lousy,\
    \ but I hope it will\n   improve with practice.\n   I'd appreciate it very much\
    \ if you could track down the\n   latest NanoConstructor ToolKit from MIT. I have\
    \ need of\n   some lab gear which isn't available here and which would be\n  \
    \ a lot easier to fabricate with the tool kit. The version I\n   have is NTK-R5\
    \ (2020) and I know there has been a lot added\n   since then.\n   Therese,\n\
    \   I wanted you to see the simulation runs, too. You may be\n   able to coax\
    \ better results from the EXAFLOP array at CERN,\n   if you still have an account\
    \ there. We're still limping\n   along with the 50 PFLOP system that Danny Hillis\
    \ donated to\n   the agency a few years back.\n   The attached HD video clip shows\
    \ the greenhouse efforts\n   here to grow grapes from the cuttings that were brought\
    \ out\n   five years ago. We're still a long ways from '82\n   Beaucastel!\n \
    \  Gotta get ready for a sampling trip to Olympus Mons, so\n   will send this\
    \ off for now.\n   Warmest regards,\n   David\n   -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\

    \   Many thanks for your note and all its news and interesting\n   data! Melanie\
    \ and I are glad to know you are settled now\n   and back at work. We've been\
    \ making heavy use of the new\n   darkside reflector telescope and, thanks to\
    \ the new petabit\n   fiber links that were introduced last year, we have very\n\
    \   effective controls from Luna City. We've been able to run\n   some really\
    \ interesting synthetic aperture observations by\n   linking the results from\
    \ the darkside array and the Earth-\n   orbiting telescopes, giving us an effective\
    \ diameter of\n   about 200,000 miles. I can hardly wait to see what we can\n\
    \   make of some of the most distant Quasars with this set-up.\n   We had quite\
    \ a scare last month when Melanie complained of\n   a recurring vertigo. None\
    \ of the usual treatments seemed to\n   help so a molecular-level brain bioscan\
    \ was done. An\n   unexpectedly high level of localized neuro-transmitter\n  \
    \ synthesis was discovered but has now been corrected by\n   auto-gene therapy.\n\
    \   As you requested, I have attached the latest\n   NanoConstructor ToolKit from\
    \ MIT.  This version integrates\n   the Knowbot control subsystem which allows\
    \ the NanoSystem\n   to be fully linked to the Internet for control, data\n  \
    \ sharing and inter-system communication. By the way, the\n   Internet Society\
    \ has negotiated a nice discount for nano-\n   fab services if you need something\
    \ more elaborate than the\n   ISEA folks have available at XOB. I could put the\n\
    \   NanoSystem on the Solex Mars/Luna run and have it to you\n   pretty quickly.\n\

    \ Hello from the Exobiology Lab!\n   Bon Jour, David!\n   I am writing to you\
    \ from the Hyatt Geosync where your email\n   was forwarded to me from INRIA.\
    \ Louis and I are here\n   vacationing for two weeks. I have some time available\
    \ and\n   will set up a simulation run on my EXAFLOP account. They\n   have the\
    \ VR-95HR/OS headsets here for entertainment\n   purposes, but they will work\
    \ fine for examining the results\n   of the simulation.\n   I have been taking\
    \ time to do some research on the\n   development of the Interplanetary Internet\
    \ and have found\n   some rather interesting results. I guess this counts as a\n\
    \   kind of paleo-networking effort, since some of the early\n   days reach back\
    \ to the 1960s. It's hard to believe that\n   anyone even knew what a computer\
    \ network was back then!\n   Did you know that the original work on Internet was\n\
    \   intended for military network use? One would never guess it\n   from the current\
    \ state of affairs, but a lot of the\n   original packet switching work on ARPANET\
    \ was done under\n   the sponsorship of something called the Advanced Research\n\
    \   Projects Agency of the US Department of Defense back in\n   1968. During the\
    \ 1970s, a number of packet networks were\n   built by ARPA and others (including\
    \ work by the predecessor\n   to INRIA, IRIA, which developed a packet network\
    \ called\n   CIGALE on which the CYCLADES network operating system was\n   built).\
    \  There was also work done by the French PTT on an\n   experimental system called\
    \ RCP that later became a\n   commercial system called TRANSPAC. Some seminal\
    \ work was\n   done in the mid-late 1960s in England at the National\n   Physical\
    \ Laboratory on a single node switch that apparently\n   served as the first local\
    \ area network! It's very hard to\n   believe that this all happened over 50 years\
    \ ago.\n   A radio-based network was developed in the same 1960s/early\n   1970s\
    \ time period called ALOHANET which featured use of a\n   randomly-shared radio\
    \ channel. This idea was later realized\n   on a coaxial cable at XEROX PARC and\
    \ called Ethernet. By\n   1978, the Internet research effort had produced 4 versions\n\
    \   of a set of protocols called \"TCP/IP\" (Transmission Control\n   Protocol/Internet\
    \ Protocol\"). These were used in\n   conjunction with devices called gateways,\
    \ back then, but\n   which became known as \"routers\". The gateways connected\n\
    \   packet networks to each other.  The combination of gateways\n   and TCP/IP\
    \ software was implemented on a lot of different\n   operating systems, especially\
    \ something called UNIX. There\n   was enough confidence in the resulting implementations\
    \ that\n   all the computers on the ARPANET and any networks linked to\n   the\
    \ ARPANET by gateways were required to switch over to use\n   TCP/IP at the beginning\
    \ of 1983. For many historians, 1983\n   marks the start of global Internet growth\
    \ although it had\n   its origins in the research effort started at Stanford\n\
    \   University in 1973, ten years earlier.\n   I am going to read more about this\
    \ and, if you are\n   interested, I can report on what happened after 1983.\n\
    \   I will leave any simulation results from the EXAFLOP runs\n   in the private\
    \ access directory in the CERN TERAFLEX\n   archive.  It will be accessible using\
    \ the JIT-ticket I have\n   attached, protected with your public key.\n   Au revoir,\

    \ UT\n   Subject: Re: Internet History\n   Jon,\n   Yes, the US National Science\
    \ Foundation (NSF) set up 5\n   super computer centers around the US and also\
    \ provided some\n   seed funding for what they called \"intermediate level\"\n\
    \   packet networks which were, in turn, connected to a\n   national backbone\
    \ network they called \"NSFNET.\" The\n   intermediate level nets connected the\
    \ user community\n   networks (mostly in research labs and universities at that\n\
    \   time) to the backbone to which the super computer sites\n   were linked. According\
    \ to my notes, NSF planned to reduce\n   funding for the various networking activities\
    \ over time on\n   the presumption that they could become self-sustaining.\n \
    \  Many of the intermediate level networks sought to create a\n   larger market\
    \ by turning to industry, which NSF permitted.\n   There was a rapid growth in\
    \ the equipment market during the\n   last half of the 1980s, for routers (the\
    \ new name for\n   gateways), work stations, network servers, and local area\n\
    \   networks.  The penetration of the equipment market led to a\n   new market\
    \ in commercial Internet services. Some of the\n   intermediate networks became\
    \ commercial services, joining\n   others that were created to meet a growing\
    \ demand for\n   Internet access.\n   By mid-1993, the system had grown to include\
    \ over 15,000\n   networks, world-wide, and over 2 million computers. They\n \
    \  must have thought this was a pretty big system, back then.\n   Actually, it\
    \ was, at the time, the largest collection of\n   networks and computers ever\
    \ interconnected. Looking back\n   from our perspective, though, this sounds like\
    \ a very\n   modest beginning, doesn't it? Nobody knew, at the time,\n   just\
    \ how many users there were, but the system was doubling\n   annually and that\
    \ attracted a lot of attention in many\n   different quarters.\n   There was an\
    \ interesting report produced by the US National\n   Academy of Science about\
    \ something they called\n   \"Collaboratories\" which was intended to convey the\
    \ idea\n   that people and computers could carry out various kinds of\n   collaborative\
    \ work if they had the right kinds of networks\n   to link their computer systems\
    \ and the right kinds of\n   applications to deal with distributed applications.\
    \ Of\n   course, we take that sort of thing for granted now, but it\n   was new\
    \ and often complicated 30 years ago.\n   I am going to try to find out how they\
    \ dealt with the\n   problem of explosive growth.\n   Louis and I will be leaving\
    \ shortly for a three-day\n   excursion to the new vari-grav habitat but I will\
    \ let you\n   know what I find out about the 1990s period in Internet\n   history\

    \ Re: Internet History\n   Therese,\n   I sent a few Knowbot programs out looking\
    \ for Internet\n   background and found an interesting archive at the Postel\n\
    \   Historical Institute in Pacific Palisades, California.\n   These folks have\
    \ an incredible collection of old documents,\n   some of them actually still on\
    \ paper, dating as far back as\n   1962! This stuff gets addicting after a while.\n\
    \   Postel apparently edited a series of reports called\n   \"Request for Comments\"\
    \ or \"RFC\" for short. These seem to be\n   one of the principal means by which\
    \ the technology of the\n   Internet has been documented, and also, as nearly\
    \ as I can\n   tell, a lot of its culture. The Institute also has a\n   phenomenal\
    \ archive of electronic mail going back to about\n   1970 (do you believe it?\
    \ Email from over 50 years ago!). I\n   don't have time to set up a really good\
    \ automatic analysis\n   of the contents, but I did leave a couple of Knowbots\n\
    \   running to find things related to growth, scaling, and\n   increased capacity\
    \ of the Internet.\n   It turns out that the technical committee called the\n\
    \   Internet Engineering Task Force was very pre-occupied in\n   the 1991-1994\
    \ period with the whole problem of\n   accommodating exponential growth in the\
    \ size of the\n   Internet. They had a bunch of different options for re-\n  \
    \ placing the then-existing IP layer with something that\n   could support a larger\
    \ address space. There were a lot of\n   arguments about how soon they would run\
    \ out of addresses\n   and a lot of uncertainty about how much functionality to\n\
    \   add on while solving the primary growth problem. Some folks\n   thought the\
    \ scaling problem was so critical that it should\n   take priority while others\
    \ thought there was still some\n   time and that new functionality would help\
    \ motivate the\n   massive effort needed to replace the then-current version 4\n\
    \   IP.\n   As it happens, they were able to achieve multiple\n   objectives,\
    \ as we now know. They found a way to increase\n   the space for identifying logical\
    \ end-points in the system\n   as well increasing the address space needed to\
    \ identify\n   physical end-points. That gave them a hook on which to base\n \
    \  the mobile, dynamic addressing capability that we now rely\n   on so heavily\
    \ in the Internet. According to the notes I\n   have seen, they were also experimenting\
    \ with new kinds of\n   applications that required different kinds of service\
    \ than\n   the usual \"best efforts\" they were able to obtain from the\n   conventional\
    \ router systems.\n   I found an absolutely hilarious \"packet video clip\" in\
    \ one\n   of the archives. It's a black-and-white, 6 frame per second\n   shot\
    \ of some guy taking off his coat, shirt and tie at one\n   of the engineering\
    \ committee meetings. His T-shirt says \"IP\n   on everything\" which must have\
    \ been some kind of slogan for\n   Internet expansion back then. Right at the\
    \ end, some big\n   bearded guy comes up and stuffs some paper money in the\n\
    \   other guy's waistband. Apparently, there are quite a few\n   other archives\
    \ of the early packet video squirreled away at\n   the PHI. I can't believe how\
    \ primitive all this stuff\n   looks. I have attached a sample for you to enjoy.\
    \ They\n   didn't have TDV back then, so you can't move the point of\n   view\
    \ around the room or anything. You just have to watch\n   the figures move jerkily\
    \ across the screen.\n   You can dig into this stuff if you send a Knowbot program\n\
    \   to concierge@phi.pacpal.ca.us. This Postel character must\n   have never thrown\

    \ UT\n   Subject: Re: Internet History\n   Jon,\n   thanks for the pointer. I\
    \ pulled up a lot of very useful\n   material from PHI. You're right, they did\
    \ manage to solve a\n   lot of problems at once with the new IP. Once they got\
    \ the\n   bugs out of the prototype implementations, it spread very\n   quickly\
    \ from the transit service companies outward towards\n   all the host computers\
    \ in the system. I also discovered\n   that they were doing research on primitive\
    \ gigabit-per-\n   second networks at that same general time. They had been\n\
    \   relying on unbelievably slow transmission systems around\n   100 megabits-per-second\
    \ and below. Can you imagine how long\n   it would take to send a typical 3DV\
    \ image at those glacial\n   speeds?\n   According to the notes I found, a lot\
    \ of the wide-area\n   system was moved over to operate on top of something they\n\
    \   called Asynchronous Transfer Mode Cell Switching or ATM for\n   short. Towards\
    \ the end of the decade, they managed to get\n   end to end transfer rates on\
    \ the order of a gigabyte per\n   second which was fairly respectable, given the\
    \ technology\n   they had at the time. Of course, the telecommunications\n   business\
    \ had been turned totally upside down in the process\n   of getting to that point.\n\
    \   It used to be the case that broadcast and cable television,\n   telephone\
    \ and publishing were different businesses. In some\n   countries, television\
    \ and telephone were monopolies\n   operated by the government or operated in\
    \ the private\n   sector with government regulation. That started changing\n \
    \  drastically as the 1990s unfolded, especially in the United\n   States where\
    \ telephone companies bought cable companies,\n   publishers owned various communication\
    \ companies and it got\n   to be very hard to figure out just what kind of company\
    \ it\n   was that should or could be regulated. There grew up an\n   amazing number\
    \ of competing ways to deliver information in\n   digital form. The same company\
    \ might offer a variety of\n   information and communication services.\n   With\
    \ regard to the Internet, it was possible to reach it\n   through mobile digital\
    \ radio, satellite, conventional wire\n   line access (quaintly called \"dial-up\"\
    ) using Integrated\n   Services Digital Networking, specially-designed modems,\n\
    \   special data services on television cable, and new fiber-\n   based services\
    \ that eventually made it even into\n   residential settings. All the bulletin\
    \ board systems got\n   connected to the Internet and surprised everyone, including\n\
    \   themselves, when the linkage created a new kind of\n   publishing environment\
    \ in which authors took direct re-\n   sponsibility for making their work accessible.\n\
    \   Interestingly, this didn't do away either with the need for\n   traditional\
    \ publishers, who filter and evaluate material\n   prior to publication, nor for\
    \ a continuing interest in\n   paper and CD-ROM. As display technology got better\
    \ and more\n   portable, though, paper became much more of a specialty\n   item.\
    \ Most documents were published on-line or on high-\n   density digital storage\
    \ media.  The basic publishing\n   process retained a heavy emphasis on editorial\
    \ selection,\n   but the mechanics shifted largely in the direction of the\n \
    \  author - with help from experts in layout and\n   accessibility. Of course,\
    \ it helped to have a universal\n   reference numbering plan which allowed authors\
    \ to register\n   documents in permanent archives. References could be made\n\
    \   to these from any other on-line context and the documents\n   retrieved readily,\
    \ possiblyat some cost for copying rights.\n   By the end of the decade, \"multimedia\"\
    \ was no longer a\n   buzz-word but a normal way of preparing and presenting\n\
    \   information. One unexpected angle: multimedia had been\n   thought to be confined\
    \ to presentation in visual and\n   audible forms for human consumption, but it\
    \ turned out that\n   including computers as senders and recipients of these\n\
    \   messages allowed them to use the digital email medium as an\n   enabling technology\
    \ for deferred, inter-computer\n   interaction.\n   Just based on what I have\
    \ been reading, one of the toughest\n   technical problems was finding good standards\
    \ to represent\n   all these different modalities. Copyright questions, which\n\
    \   had been thought to be what they called \"show-stoppers,\"\n   turned out\
    \ to be susceptible to largely-established case\n   law. Abusing access to digital\
    \ information was impeded in\n   large degree by wrapping publications in software\
    \ shields,\n   but in the end, abuses were still possible and abusers were\n \
    \  prosecuted.\n   On the policy side, there was a strong need to apply\n   cryptography\
    \ for authentication and for privacy. This was a\n   big struggle for many governments,\
    \ including ours here in\n   France,  where there are very strong views and laws\
    \ on this\n   subject, but ultimately, the need for commonality on a\n   global\
    \ basis outweighed many of the considerations that\n   inhibited the use of this\
    \ valuable technology.\n   Well, that takes us up to about 20 years ago, which\
    \ still\n   seems a far cry from our current state of technology. With\n   over\
    \ a billion computers in the system and most of the\n   populations of information-intensive\
    \ countries fully\n   linked, some of the more technically-astute back at the\n\
    \   turn of the millennium may have had some inkling of what\n   was in store\
    \ for the next two decades.\n   Therese\n   -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\

    \  Therese and Jon,\n   This is really fascinating! I found some more material,\n\
    \   thanks to the Internet Society, which summarizes the\n   technical developments\
    \ over the last 20 years. Apparently\n   one of the key events was the development\
    \ of all-optical\n   transmission, switching and computing in a cost-effective\n\
    \   way.  For a long time, this technology involved rather\n   bulky equipment\
    \ - some of the early 3DV clips from 2000-\n   2005 showed rooms full of gear\
    \ required to steer beams\n   around. A very interesting combination of fiber\
    \ optics and\n   three-dimensional electro-optical integrated circuits\n   collapsed\
    \ a lot of this to sizes more like what we are\n   accustomed to today. Using\
    \ pico- and femto- molecular\n   fabrication methods, it has been possible to\
    \ build very\n   compact, extremely high speed computing and communication\n \
    \  devices.\n   I guess those guys at Xerox PARC who imagined that there\n   might\
    \ be hundreds of millions of computers in the world,\n   hundreds or even thousands\
    \ of them for each person, would\n   be pleased to see how clear their vision\
    \ was. The only\n   really bad thing, as I see it, is that those guys who were\n\
    \   trying to figure out how to deal with Internet expansion\n   really blew it\
    \ when they picked a measly 64 bit address\n   space. I hear we are running really\
    \ tight again. I wonder\n   why they didn't have enough sense just to allocate\
    \ at least\n   1024 bits to make sure we'd have enough room for the\n   obvious\
    \ applications we can see we want, now?\n   David\n   -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n"
