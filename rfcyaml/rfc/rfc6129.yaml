- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Text Encoding and Interchange (TEI) is an international\
    \ and\n   interdisciplinary standard that is widely used by libraries, museums,\n\
    \   publishers, and individual scholars to represent all kinds of textual\n  \
    \ material for online research and teaching [TEI].\n   This document defines the\
    \ 'application/tei+xml' media type in\n   accordance with [RFC3023] in order to\
    \ enable generic processing of\n   such documents on the Internet using eXtensible\
    \ Markup Language (XML)\n   [W3C.REC-xml-20081126] technologies.\n"
- title: 2.  Recognizing TEI Files
  contents:
  - "2.  Recognizing TEI Files\n   TEI files are XML documents or fragments having\
    \ the root element (as\n   defined in [W3C.REC-xml-20081126]) in a TEI namespace.\
    \  TEI namespace\n   names are defined as a Universal Resource Identifier (URI)\
    \ [RFC3986]\n   in accordance with [W3C.REC-xml-names-20091208] and begins with\n\
    \   http://www.tei-c.org/ns/ followed by the version number of the\n   namespace.\
    \  The current namespace is http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\n   The most common root\
    \ element names for TEI documents are\n      <TEI>\n      <teiCorpus>\n   The\
    \ teiCorpus documents provide the ability to bundle multiple\n   documents into\
    \ a single file.\n   Examples:\n      A document having <TEI> root element\n \
    \              <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n               <TEI\
    \ xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\">\n                  <teiHeader>\n    \
    \              ...\n                  </teiHeader>\n                  <text>\n\
    \                  ...\n                  </text>\n               </TEI>\n   \
    \   A document having <teiCorpus> root element\n               <?xml version=\"\
    1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n               <teiCorpus xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"\
    >\n                  <teiHeader>\n                  ...\n                  </teiHeader>\n\
    \                  <TEI>\n                     <teiHeader>\n                 \
    \    ...\n                     </teiHeader>\n                     <text>\n   \
    \                  ...\n                     </text>\n                  </TEI>\n\
    \                  <TEI>\n                  ... second document ...\n        \
    \          </TEI>\n                  <TEI>\n                  ... third document\
    \  ...\n                  </TEI>\n               </teiCorpus>\n   TEI and teiCorpus\
    \ files are often given the extensions .tei and\n   .teiCorpus, respectively.\
    \  There is a third type of file, which often\n   is given the suffix .odd.  ODD\
    \ (\"One Document Does it All\") is a TEI\n   XML document that includes schema\
    \ fragments, prose documentation, and\n   reference documentation.  It is used\
    \ for the definition and\n   documentation of XML-based languages, and primarily\
    \ for the TEI\n   Guidelines [ODD].  In other words, ODD files do not differ from\
    \ other\n   TEI files in syntax, only in function.\n"
- title: 3.  Fragment Identifier
  contents:
  - "3.  Fragment Identifier\n   Documents having the media type 'application/tei+xml'\
    \ use the\n   fragment identifier notation as specified in [RFC3023] for the media\n\
    \   type 'application/xml'.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   An XML resource does not in itself compromise\
    \ data security.  When\n   being available on a network simply through the dereferencing\
    \ of an\n   Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) [RFC3987] or a URI, care\n\
    \   must be taken to properly interpret the data to prevent unintended\n   access.\
    \  Hence the security issues of [RFC3986], Section 7, apply.\n   In addition,\
    \ as this media type uses the \"+xml\" convention, it shares\n   the same security\
    \ considerations as described in RFC 3023 [RFC3023],\n   Section 10.  In general,\
    \ security issues related to the use of XML in\n   IETF protocols are treated\
    \ in RFC 3470 [RFC3470], Section 7.  We will\n   not try to duplicate this material,\
    \ but review some aspects that are\n   important for document-centric XML as applied\
    \ to text encoding.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Harmful Content
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Harmful Content\n   Any application accepting submitted or retrieving TEI\
    \ XML for\n   processing has to be aware of risks connected with injection of\n\
    \   harmful scripts and executable XML.  XML inclusion\n   [W3C.REC-xinclude-20061115]\
    \ and the use of external entities are\n   vulnerable to various forms of spoofing,\
    \ and can also reveal aspects\n   of a service in a way that may compromise its\
    \ security.  Any\n   vulnerability of these kinds are, however, application specific.\
    \  The\n   TEI namespaces do not contain such elements.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Intellectual Property Rights
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Intellectual Property Rights\n   TEI documents often arise in digitization\
    \ of cultural heritage\n   materials.  Texts made accessible in TEI format may\
    \ be unrestricted\n   in the sense that their distribution may be unlimited by\
    \ Digital\n   Rights Management [DRM] or Intellectual Property Rights [IPR]\n\
    \   constraints.  However, TEI documents are heterogeneous.  Some parts\n   of\
    \ a document may be unrestricted, whereas others, such as editorial\n   text and\
    \ annotations, may be subject to DRM restrictions.\n   The TEI format provides\
    \ means for highly granular attribution, down\n   to the content of individual\
    \ XML elements.  Software agents\n   participating in the exchange or processing\
    \ TEI may be required to\n   honour markup of this kind.  Even when there are\
    \ no IPR constraints,\n   intellectual property attribution alone requires that\
    \ document users\n   be able to tell the difference between content from different\n\
    \   sources.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Authenticity and confidentiality
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Authenticity and confidentiality\n   Historical archival records are often\
    \ encoded in TEI and legal\n   document may be binding centuries after they were\
    \ written.\n   Digitization and encoding of legal texts may require technologies\
    \ for\n   assuring authenticity, such as cryptographic checksums and electronic\n\
    \   signatures.\n   Similarly, historical documents may in part or in their entirety\
    \ be\n   confidential.  This may be required by law or by the terms and\n   conditions,\
    \ such as in the case of donated or deposited text from\n   private sources. \
    \ A text archive may need content filtering or\n   cryptographic technologies\
    \ to meet such requirements.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Registration of MIME Type 'application/tei+xml'
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Registration of MIME Type 'application/tei+xml'\n      MIME media type\
    \ name: application\n      MIME subtype name: tei+xml\n      Required parameters:\
    \ None\n      Optional parameters: charset\n         the parameter has identical\
