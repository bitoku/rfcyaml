- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4308] proposes two optional cryptographic user interface\
    \ suites\n   (\"UI suites\") for IPsec.  The two suites, VPN-A and VPN-B, represent\n\
    \   commonly used present-day corporate VPN security choices and\n   anticipated\
    \ future choices, respectively.  This document proposes\n   four new UI suites\
    \ based on implementations of the United States\n   National Security Agency's\
    \ Suite B algorithms (see [SuiteB]).\n   As with the VPN suites, the Suite B suites\
    \ are simply collections of\n   values for some options in IPsec.  Use of UI suites\
    \ does not change\n   the IPsec protocols in any way.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\"\
    , \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   in this document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  New UI Suites
  contents:
  - "3.  New UI Suites\n   Each of the following UI suites provides choices for ESP\
    \ (see\n   [RFC4303]) and for IKEv1 and IKEv2 (see [RFC2409] and [RFC4306]).\n\
    \   The four suites are differentiated by the choice of cryptographic\n   algorithm\
    \ strengths and a choice of whether the Encapsulating\n   Security Payload (ESP)\
    \ is to provide both confidentiality and\n   integrity or integrity only.  The\
    \ suite names are based on the\n   Advanced Encryption Standard [AES] mode and\
    \ AES key length specified\n   for ESP.\n   IPsec implementations that use these\
    \ UI suites SHOULD use the suite\n   names listed here.  IPsec implementations\
    \ SHOULD NOT use names\n   different than those listed here for the suites that\
    \ are described,\n   and MUST NOT use the names listed here for suites that do\
    \ not match\n   these values.  These requirements are necessary for interoperability.\n"
