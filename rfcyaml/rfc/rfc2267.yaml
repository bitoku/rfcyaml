  - "1. Introduction\n   A resurgence of Denial of Service Attacks [1] aimed at various\n\
    \   targets in the Internet have produced new challenges within the\n   Internet\
    \ Service Provider (ISP) and network security communities to\n   find new and\
    \ innovative methods to mitigate these types of attacks.\n   The difficulties\
    \ in reaching this goal are numerous; some simple\n   tools already exist to limit\
    \ the effectiveness and scope of these\n   attacks, but they have not been widely\
    \ implemented.\n   This method of attack has been known for some time. Defending\
    \ against\n   it, however, has been an ongoing concern. Bill Cheswick is quoted\
    \ in\n   [2] as saying that he pulled a chapter from his book, \"Firewalls and\n\
    \   Internet Security\" [3], at the last minute because there was no way\n   for\
    \ an administrator of the system under attack to effectively defend\n   the system.\
    \ By mentioning the method, he was concerned about\n   encouraging it's use.\n\
    \   While the filtering method discussed in this document does\n   absolutely\
    \ nothing to protect against flooding attacks which\n   originate from valid prefixes\
    \ (IP addresses), it will prohibit an\n   attacker within the originating network\
    \ from launching an attack of\n   this nature using forged source addresses that\
    \ do not conform to\n   ingress filtering rules. All providers of Internet connectivity\
    \ are\n   urged to implement filtering described in this document to prohibit\n\
    \   attackers from  using forged source addresses which do not reside\n   within\
    \ a range of legitimately advertised prefixes.  In other words,\n   if an ISP\
    \ is aggregating routing announcements for multiple\n   downstream networks, strict\
    \ traffic filtering should be used to\n   prohibit traffic which claims to have\
    \ originated from outside of\n   these aggregated announcements.\n   An additional\
    \ benefit of implementing this type of filtering is that\n   it enables the originator\
    \ to be easily traced to it's true source,\n   since the attacker would have to\
    \ use a valid, and legitimately\n   reachable, source address.\n"

  - "2. Background\n   A simplified diagram of the TCP SYN flooding problem is depicted\n\
    \   below:\n                                                       9.0.0.0/8\n\
    \    host <----- router <--- Internet <----- router <-- attacker\n           \
    \  TCP/SYN\n         <---------------------------------------------\n        \
    \       Source: 192.168.0.4/32\n    SYN/ACK\n    no route\n             TCP/SYN\n\
    \         <---------------------------------------------\n               Source:\
    \ 10.0.0.13/32\n    SYN/ACK\n    no route\n             TCP/SYN\n         <---------------------------------------------\n\
    \               Source: 172.16.0.2/32\n    SYN/ACK\n    no route\n    [etc.]\n\
    \    Assume:\n    o The \"host\" is the targeted machine.\n    o The attacker\
    \ resides within the \"valid\" prefix, 9.0.0.0/8.\n    o The attacker launches\
    \ the attack using randomly changing source\n      addresses; in this example,\
    \ the source addresses are depicted as\n      from within [4], which are not generally\
    \ present in the global\n      Internet routing tables, and therefore, unreachable.\
    \ However, any\n      unreachable prefix could be used to perpetrate this attack\n\
    \      method.\n   Also worthy of mention is a case wherein the source address\
    \ is forged\n   to appear to have originated from within another legitimate network\n\
    \   which appears in the global routing table(s). For example, an\n   attacker\
    \ using a valid network address could wreak havoc by  making\n   the attack appear\
    \ to come from an organization which did not, in\n   fact, originate the attack\
    \ and was completely innocent. In such\n   cases, the administrator of a system\
    \ under attack may be inclined to\n   filter all traffic coming from the apparent\
    \ attack source. Adding\n   such a filter would then result in a denial of service\
    \ to\n   legitimate, non-hostile end-systems. In this case, the administrator\n\
    \   of the system under attack unwittingly becomes an accomplice of the\n   attacker.\n\
    \   Further complicating matters, TCP SYN flood attacks will result in\n   SYN-ACK\
    \ packets being sent to one or many hosts which have no\n   involvement in the\
    \ attack, but which become secondary victims. This\n   allows the attacker to\
    \ abuse two or more systems at once.\n   Similar attacks have been attempted using\
    \ UDP and ICMP flooding.\n   The former attack (UDP flooding) uses forged packets\
    \ to try and\n   connect the chargen UDP service to the echo UDP service at another\n\
    \   site.  Systems administrators should NEVER allow UDP packets destined\n  \
    \ for system diagnostic ports from outside of their administrative\n   domain\
    \ to reach their systems. The latter attack (ICMP flooding),\n   uses an insidious\
    \ feature in IP subnet broadcast replication\n   mechanics. This attack relies\
    \ on a router serving a large multi-\n   access broadcast network to frame an\
    \ IP broadcast address (such as\n   one destined for 10.255.255.255) into a Layer\
    \ 2 broadcast frame (for\n   ethernet, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF). Ethernet NIC hardware\
    \ (MAC-layer\n   hardware, specifically) will only listen to a select number of\n\
    \   addresses in normal operation.  The one MAC address that all devices\n   share\
    \ in common in normal operation is the media broadcast, or\n   FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.\
    \  In this case, a device will take the packet and\n   send an interrupt for processing.\
    \ Thus, a flood of these broadcast\n   frames will consume all available resources\
    \ on an end-system [9]. It\n   is perhaps prudent that system administrators should\
    \ consider\n   ensuring that their border routers do not allow directed broadcast\n\
    \   packets to be forwarded through their routers as a default.\n   When an TCP\
    \ SYN attack is launched using unreachable source address,\n   the target host\
    \ attempts to reserve resources waiting for a\n   response.  The attacker repeatedly\
    \ changes the bogus source address\n   on each new packet sent, thus exhausting\
    \ additional host resources.\n   Alternatively, if the attacker uses someone else's\
    \ valid host\n   address as the source address, the system under attack will send\
    \ a\n   large number of SYN/ACK packets to what it believes is the originator\n\
    \   of the connection establishment sequence. In this fashion, the\n   attacker\
    \ does damage to two systems: the destination target system,\n   as well  as the\
    \ system which is actually using the spoofed address in\n   the global routing\
    \ system.\n   The result of both attack methods is extremely degraded performance,\n\
    \   or worse, a system crash.\n   In response to this threat, most operating system\
    \ vendors have\n   modified their software to allow the targeted servers to sustain\n\
    \   attacks with very high connection attempt rates. This is a welcome\n   and\
    \ necessary part of the solution to the problem. Ingress filtering\n   will take\
    \ time to be implemented pervasively and be fully effective,\n   but the extensions\
    \ to the operating systems can be implemented\n   quickly. This combination should\
    \ prove effective against source\n   address spoofing. See [1] for vendor and\
    \ platform software upgrade\n   information.\n"
- title: 3. Restricting forged traffic

  - "3. Restricting forged traffic\n   The problems encountered with this type of\
    \ attack are numerous, and\n   involve shortcomings in host software implementations,\
    \ routing\n   methodologies, and the TCP/IP protocols themselves.  However, by\n\
    \   restricting transit traffic which originates from a downstream\n   network\
    \ to known, and intentionally advertised, prefix(es), the\n   problem of source\
    \ address spoofing can be virtually eliminated in\n   this attack scenario.\n\

    \ the attacker resides within 9.0.0.0/8, which is\n   provided Internet connectivity\
    \ by ISP D.  An input traffic filter on\n   the ingress (input) link of \"router\
    \ 2\", which provides connectivity\n   to the attacker's network, restricts traffic\
    \ to allow only traffic\n   originating from source addresses within the 9.0.0.0/8\
    \ prefix, and\n   prohibits an attacker from using \"invalid\" source addresses\
    \ which\n   reside outside of this prefix range.\n   In other words, the ingress\
    \ filter on \"router 2\" above would check:\n    IF    packet's source address\

    \ source address is anything else\n    THEN  deny packet\n   Network administrators\
    \ should log information on packets which are\n   dropped. This then provides\

- title: 4. Further possible capabilities for networking equipment

  - "4. Further possible capabilities for networking equipment\n   Additional functions\
    \ should be considered for future platform\n   implementations. The following\
    \ one is worth noting:\n      o Implementation of automatic filtering on remote\
    \ access servers.\n        In most cases, a user dialing into an access server\
    \ is an\n        individual user on a single PC. The ONLY valid source IP address\n\
    \        for packets originating from that PC is the one assigned by the\n   \
    \     ISP (whether statically or dynamically assigned). The remote\n        access\
    \ server could check every packet on ingress to ensure the\n        user is not\
    \ spoofing the source address on the packets which he\n        is originating.\
    \ Obviously, provisions also need to be made for\n        cases where the customer\
    \ legitimately is attaching a net or\n        subnet via a remote router, but\
    \ this could certainly be\n        implemented as an optional parameter. We have\
    \ received reports\n        that some vendors and some ISPs are already starting\
    \ to\n        implement this  capability.\n   We considered suggesting routers\
    \ also validate the source IP address\n   of the sender as suggested in [8], but\
    \ that methodology will not\n   operate well in the real networks out there today.\
    \ The method\n   suggested is to look up source addresses to see that the return\
    \ path\n   to that address would flow out the same interface as the packet\n \
    \  arrived upon. With the number of asymmetric routes in the Internet,\n   this\
    \ would clearly be problematic.\n"

  - "5. Liabilities\n   Filtering of this nature has the potential to break some types\
    \ of\n   \"special\" services. It is in the best interest of the ISP offering\n\
    \   these types of special services, however, to consider alternate\n   methods\
    \ of implementing these services to avoid being affected by\n   ingress traffic\
    \ filtering.\n   Mobile IP, as defined in [6], is specifically affected by ingress\n\
    \   traffic filtering. As specified, traffic to the mobile node is\n   tunneled,\
    \ but traffic from the mobile node is not tunneled. This\n   results in packets\
    \ from the mobile node(s) which have source\n   addresses that do not match with\
    \ the network where the station is\n   attached.  The Mobile IP Working Group\
    \ is addressing this problem by\n   specifying \"reverse tunnels\" in [7].  This\
    \ work in progress provides\n   a method for the data transmitted from the mobile\
    \ node to be tunneled\n   to the home agent before transmission to the Internet.\
    \  There are\n   additional benefits to the reverse tunneling scheme, including\
    \ better\n   handling of multicast traffic. Those implementing mobile IP systems\n\
    \   are encouraged to implement this method of reverse tunneling.\n   As mentioned\
    \ previously, while ingress traffic filtering drastically\n   reduces the success\
    \ of source address spoofing, it does not preclude\n   an attacker using a forged\
    \ source address of another host within the\n   permitted prefix filter range.\
    \ It does, however, ensure that when an\n   attack of this nature does indeed\
    \ occur, a network administrator can\n   be sure that the attack is actually originating\
    \ from within the known\n   prefixes that are being advertised. This simplifies\
    \ tracking down the\n   culprit, and at worst, the administrator can block a range\
    \ of source\n   addresses until the problem is resolved.\n   If ingress filtering\
    \ is used in an environment where DHCP or BOOTP is\n   used, the network administrator\
    \ would be well advised to ensure that\n   packets with a source address of 0.0.0.0\
    \ and a destination of\n   255.255.255.255 are allowed to reach the relay agent\
    \ in routers when\n   appropriate.  The scope of directed broadcast replication\
    \  should be\n   controlled, however, and not arbitrarily forwarded.\n"

  - "6. Summary\n   Ingress traffic filtering at the periphery of Internet connected\n\
    \   networks will reduce the effectiveness of source address spoofing\n   denial\
    \ of service attacks. Network service providers and\n   administrators have already\
    \ begun implementing this type of filtering\n   on periphery routers, and it is\
    \ recommended that all service\n   providers do so as soon as possible. In addition\
    \ to aiding the\n   Internet community as a whole to defeat this attack method,\
    \ it can\n   also assist service providers in locating the source of the attack\
    \ if\n   service providers can categorically demonstrate that their network\n\
    \   already has ingress filtering in place on customer links.\n   Corporate network\
    \ administrators should implement filtering to ensure\n   their corporate networks\
    \ are not the source of such problems. Indeed,\n   filtering could be used within\
    \ an organization to ensure users do not\n   cause problems by improperly attaching\
    \ systems to the wrong networks.\n   The filtering could also, in practice, block\
    \ a disgruntled employee\n   from anonymous attacks.\n   It is the responsibility\
    \ of all network administrators to ensure they\n   do not become the unwitting\
    \ source of an attack of this nature.\n"
