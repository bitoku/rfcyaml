Abstract This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace that is engineered by the Open Grid Forum (OGF) for naming persistent resources.
The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is a standardisation development organisation in the field of distributed computing.
The OGF produces documents such as working drafts, specifications, and schemata.
For more information, see <http://www.ogf.org/>.
Working groups in the OGF community have expressed the need for global, distributed, persistent identifiers in working drafts and standards.
Motivated by this need, the OGF would like to assign URNs to some resources in order to retain unique, permanent, location  independent names for them.
This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
2.  URN Specification for "ogf" Namespace ID (NID) 2.1.
Namespace ID "ogf" (where "ogf" is an acronym for "Open Grid Forum").
Registration Information Registration Version Number: 1 Registration Date: December 2011 2.3.
Declared Registrant of the Namespace Technical Director Open Grid Forum P.O. Box 1738
Indiana  47308 USA http://www.ogf.org/ EMail:
The position of Technical Director is currently fulfilled by Joel Replogle.
The formal syntax definitions below are given in ABNF [RFC5234].
The namespace specific string (NSS) in the urn:ogf names hierarchy begins with a subnamespace identifier (SNID), followed by a delimiter and a subnamespace dependent string
> is a unique subnamespace identifier for the specification, and <SUBNAMESPACE SPECIFIC STRING> is a unique identifier within the subnamespace identifier scope.
The Technical Director at OGF (or their successors) assigns SNIDs.
The syntax of <SUBNAMESPACE SPECIFIC STRING> is dependent on the <SNID> and MUST be defined by a Grid Forum Document [GFD.1].
This document does not pose any additional restrictions to the <SUBNAMESPACE SPECIFIC STRING> other than what is defined in the NSS syntax as defined by [RFC2141] or its successor: SUBNAMESPACE
1 <URN chars> <URN chars
> is defined in Section 2.2 of [RFC2141].
Relevant Ancillary Documentation The Technical Director at OGF (or their successors) will keep a list of assigned subnamespace identifiers and associated documentation at <http://www.ogf.org/urn/> [URN OGF].
The procedures regarding how to register a subnamespace identifier are described in [GFD.191] and can also be found at the above Website.
Identifier Uniqueness Considerations Identifier uniqueness will be enforced by the Technical Director of the Open Grid Forum.
The OGF Technical Director may sub delegate part of the namespace to third parties.
It will not be permissible, neither by the OGF nor any third party, to re assign previously assigned URNs.
A practical consequence is that a previously assigned subnamespace cannot be re assigned, unless additional arrangements are made to prevent identifier re assignments.
The Technical Director will only assign subnamespace identifiers for persistent resources.
In order to enforce identifier persistence for individual resources, each document defining subnamespace identifiers MUST contain a section on the type of resource that is specified (e.g., whether a URN in the subnamespace identifies a specific version of a resource, the latest version of a resource, a specific manifestation, or a more general concept).
The namespace identifier "ogf" MUST NOT change, even if the Open Grid Forum changes its name or is disbanded.
Process of Identifier Assignment Assignment of subnamespace identifiers is limited to the OGF and those authorities that are specifically designated by the OGF Technical Director of the OGF.
The OGF may assign portions of its namespace (specifically, those under designated subnamespace identifiers) for assignment by third parties.
The details of this process are specified in [GFD.191].
The syntax and semantics of each subnamespace MUST be defined by a Grid Forum Document [GFD.1] before the corresponding SNID is assigned.
The OGF namespace is not currently listed with a Resolution Discovery System (RDS), but nothing about the namespace prohibits the future definition of appropriate resolution methods or listing with an RDS.
The OGF will maintain an index of all subnamespace identifiers on its Website <http://www.ogf.org/urn/>.
This list may refer to known Resolution Discovery Systems.
The <SNID> part of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is case insensitive.
Thus, the <SNID> MUST be case normalised before comparison.
The rules for lexical equivalence of the <SUBNAMESPACE SPECIFIC STRING> part of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is specific for each SNID and MUST be defined when a SNID is assigned by the OGF Technical Director.
These definitions MUST include information about case sensitivity, and in the case of % escaped octets, MUST define the exact normalisation to be used (e.g., interpret as octet, interpret as UTF 8, specify type of Unicode normalisation factor, etc.).
The intention of this document is to only restrict the syntax of the <SNID>.
The syntax of the <SUBNAMESPACE SPECIFIC STRING> follows the general syntax of a URN:
> Documents defining a subnamespace identifier SHOULD specify further syntactic restrictions in <SUBNAMESPACE SPECIFIC STRING
This is in accordance with Section 2.2 of [RFC3986].
For forward compatibility, it is RECOMMENDED that software implementations that don't validate subnamespace specific strings validate the syntax according to the generic rules for validating URIs, as defined in [RFC3986].
URIs may contain all characters defined in <URN chars>, including the characters in <reserved>
The validation mechanism of URNs in the OGF hierarchy is specific for each SNID and SHOULD be defined when a SNID is assigned by the OGF Technical Director.
URNs in the OGF hierarchy without an assigned SNID are considered to be invalid.
Scope Global URNs are relevant for the distributed computing community in general, and the Open Grid Forum in particular.
Since no subnamespace identifiers have been defined yet, no actual examples can be given.
Therefore, the following examples are not guaranteed to be real or even syntactically correct.
Grid Forum Documents defining the "gfd" and "network"
subnamespace identifiers may give the following examples.

The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is a standardisation development organisation in the field of distributed computing.
The use of the OGF hierarchy is expected to be broad, including but not limited to usage for:  Grid Forum Documents  XML (Extensible Markup Language)
Schemata  RDF (Resource Description Framework)
The Open Grid Forum is dedicated to openly publishing all technical documentation related to URNs in the OGF hierarchy and allowing unlimited distribution of these documents.
Community Considerations Members of the distributed computing community will benefit from persistent and globally unique identifiers for use in protocols developed by the Open Grid Forum.
Practical use of the urn:ogf namespace has been detected, and a formal registration will allow the Open Grid Forum to document this usage and enforce technical review of current practices.
There are no additional security considerations other than those normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general, which are described in [RFC1737], [RFC2141], and [RFC3406].
It is recommended that implementers check the OGF registry and documentation [URN OGF] before assuming that a given identifier is valid or has a certain meaning.
IANA Considerations IANA has registered the "ogf" namespace identifier (NID) with a reference to this document in the "Formal URN Namespaces" sub registry [RFC3406] of the "Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces" registry [URN NAMESPACES].
