- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The first Request for Comments (RFC) document was published\
    \ in April\n   of 1969 as part of the effort to design and build what we now know\
    \ of\n   as the Internet.  Since then, the RFC Series has been the archival\n\
    \   series dedicated to documenting Internet technical specifications,\n   including\
    \ both general contributions from the Internet research and\n   engineering community\
    \ as well as standards documents.\n   As described in the history of the first\
    \ 30 years of RFCs\n   ([RFC2555]), the RFC Series was created for the purpose\
    \ of capturing\n   the research and engineering thought that underlie the design\
    \ of\n   (what we now know of as) the Internet.  As the Internet Engineering\n\
    \   Task Force (IETF) was formalized to carry out the discussion and\n   documentation\
    \ of Internet standards, IETF documents have become a\n   large part (but not\
    \ the entirety) of the RFC Series.\n   As the IETF has grown up and celebrated\
    \ its own 30 years of history,\n   its requirements for archival publication of\
    \ its output have changed\n   and become more rigorous.  Perhaps most significantly,\
    \ the IETF must\n   be able to define (based on its own open consensus discussion\n\
    \   processes and leadership directions) and implement adjustments to its\n  \
    \ publication processes.\n   At the same time, the Internet engineering and research\
    \ community as\n   a whole has grown and come to require more openness and\n \
    \  accountability in all organizations supporting it.  More than ever,\n   this\
    \ community needs an RFC Series that is supported (operationally\n   and in terms\
    \ of its principles) such that there is a balance of:\n   *  expert implementation;\n\
    \   *  clear management and direction -- for operations and evolution\n      across\
    \ the whole RFC Series (whether originating in the IETF or\n      not); and\n\
    \   *  appropriate community input into and review of activities.\n   In the past,\
    \ there has been confusion and therefore sometimes tension\n   over where and\
    \ how to address RFC issues that are particular to\n   contributing groups (e.g.,\
    \ the IETF, the Internet Architecture Board\n   (IAB), or independent individuals).\
    \  It was not always clear where\n   there should be community involvement versus\
    \ RFC Editor control;\n   depending on the issue, there might be more or less\
    \ involvement from\n   the IAB, the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG),\
    \ or the\n   community at large.  There are similar issues with handling RFC\n\
    \   Series-wide issues -- where to discuss and resolve them in a way that\n  \
    \ is balanced across the whole series.\n   For example, there have been discussions\
    \ about Intellectual Property\n   Rights (IPR) for IETF-generated documents, but\
    \ it's not clear when or\n   how to abstract the portions of those discussions\
    \ that are relevant\n   to the rest of the RFC Series.  Discussions of labeling\
    \ (of RFCs in\n   general, IETF documents in particular, or some combination thereof)\n\
    \   generally must be applied to the whole RFC Series or not at all.\n   Without\
    \ an agreed-on framework for managing the RFC Series, it is\n   difficult to have\
    \ those discussions in a non-polarized fashion --\n   either the IETF dictating\
    \ the reality of the rest of the RFC Series,\n   or the RFC Series imposing undue\
    \ restrictions on documents from the\n   IETF.\n   As part of its charter (see\
    \ Appendix A), the IAB has a responsibility\n   for the RFC Editor.  Acknowledging\
    \ the IETF's needs and the general\n   Internet engineering and research community's\
    \ evolving needs, the IAB\n   supports a future for the RFC Series that continues\
    \ to meet its\n   original mandate of providing the archival series for the technical\n\
    \   research and engineering documentation that describes the Internet.\n   With\
    \ this document, the IAB provides the framework for the RFC Series\n   and an\
    \ RFC Editor function with the specific purpose of ensuring that\n   the RFC Series\
    \ is maintained and supported in ways that are\n   consistent with the stated\
    \ purpose of the RFC Series and the\n   realities of today's Internet research\
    \ and engineering community.\n   The framework describes the existing \"streams\"\
    \ of RFCs, draws a\n   roadmap of existing process documents already defining\
    \ the\n   implementation, and provides clear direction of how to evolve this\n\
    \   framework and its supporting pieces through discussion and future\n   document\
    \ revision.\n   Specifically, this document provides a brief charter for the RFC\n\
    \   Series, describes the role of the RFC Editor, the IAB, and the IETF\n   Administrative\
    \ Support Activity (IASA) in a framework for managing\n   the RFC Series, and\
    \ discusses the streams of input to the RFC Series\n   from the various constituencies\
    \ it serves.\n"
- title: 2.  RFC Series Mission
  contents:
  - "2.  RFC Series Mission\n   The RFC Series is the archival series dedicated to\
    \ documenting\n   Internet technical specifications, including general contributions\n\
    \   from the Internet research and engineering community as well as\n   standards\
    \ documents.\n   RFCs are available free of charge to anyone via the Internet.\n"
- title: 3.  Roles and Responsibilities
  contents:
  - "3.  Roles and Responsibilities\n   As this document sets out the framework for\
    \ supporting the RFC Series\n   mission, this section reviews the updated roles\
    \ and responsibilities\n   of the entities that have had, and will have, involvement\
    \ in\n   continued support of the mission.\n"
- title: 3.1.  RFC Editor
  contents:
  - "3.1.  RFC Editor\n   Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of\
    \ the RFC\n   Series (the RFC Editor).  The task has grown, and the work now\n\
    \   requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are RFC\n   Editors,\
    \ or an RFC Editor organization.  In time, there may be\n   multiple organizations\
    \ working together to undertake the work\n   required by the RFC Series.  For\
    \ simplicity's sake, and without\n   attempting to predict how the role might\
    \ be subdivided among them,\n   this document refers to this collection of experts\
    \ and organizations\n   as the \"RFC Editor\".\n   The RFC Editor is an expert\
    \ technical editor and series editor,\n   acting to support the mission of the\
    \ RFC Series.  As such, the RFC\n   Editor is the implementer handling the editorial\
    \ management of the\n   RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes.\
    \  In addition,\n   the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime mover\
    \ in\n   discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving\n \
    \  RFCs.\n"
- title: 3.2.  IAB
  contents:
  - "3.2.  IAB\n   In this model, the role of the IAB is to ensure that the RFC Series\n\
    \   mission is being appropriately fulfilled for the whole community for\n   which\
    \ it was created.  The IAB does not, organizationally, have\n   comprehensive\
    \ publishing or editorial expertise.  Therefore, the role\n   of the IAB is focused\
    \ on ensuring that principles are met, the\n   appropriate bodies and communities\
    \ are duly informed and consulted,\n   and the RFC Editor has what it needs in\
    \ order to execute on the\n   material that is in their mandate.\n   It is the\
    \ responsibility of the IAB to approve the appointment of the\n   RFC Editor and\
    \ to approve the general policy followed by the RFC\n   Editor.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Operational Oversight
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Operational Oversight\n   The IETF Administration Limited Liability Company\
    \ (IETF LLC), as part\n   of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA),\
    \ is responsible\n   for administrative and financial matters for the IETF, the\
    \ IAB, and\n   the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) [RFC8711].  The IASA is\n\
    \   tasked with providing the funding for the RFC Editor.  The IASA,\n   through\
    \ the IETF Executive Director, provides contractual and\n   financial oversight\
    \ of the RFC Editor.  Additionally, as described in\n   Section 3.1 of [RFC8728],\
    \ the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC),\n   acting with authority delegated\
    \ from the IAB, is responsible for\n   ensuring that the RFC Series is run in\
    \ a transparent and accountable\n   manner, including design and execution of\
    \ the RFC Series Editor\n   selection process.\n   The IETF Executive Director\
    \ works with the IAB to identify suitable\n   persons or entities to fulfill the\
    \ mandate of the RFC Production\n   Center and the RFC Publisher roles as defined\
    \ in [RFC8728].\n   The IETF Executive Director establishes appropriate contractual\n\
    \   agreements with the selected persons or entities to carry out the\n   work\
    \ that will satisfy the technical publication requirements defined\n   for the\
    \ various RFC input streams (see Section 5.2).  The IETF\n   Executive Director\
    \ may define additional operational requirements and\n   policies for management\
    \ purposes to meet the requirements defined by\n   the various communities.\n\
    \   The IETF Administration LLC Board approves a budget for operation of\n   the\
    \ RFC Editor activity, and the IETF Executive Director establishes\n   and manages\
    \ the necessary operational agreements for the RFC Editor\n   activity.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Policy Oversight
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Policy Oversight\n   The IAB monitors the effectiveness of the policies\
    \ in force and their\n   implementation to ensure that the RFC Editor activity\
    \ meets the\n   editorial management and document publication needs as referenced\
    \ in\n   this document.  In the event of serious non-conformance, the IAB,\n \
    \  either on its own initiative or at the request of the IETF\n   Administration\
    \ LLC Board, may require the IETF Executive Director to\n   vary or terminate\
    \ and renegotiate the arrangements for the RFC Editor\n   activity.\n"
- title: 4.  Framework
  contents:
  - "4.  Framework\n   With the RFC Series mission outlined above, this document describes\
    \ a\n   framework for supporting\n   *  the operational implementation of the\
    \ RFC Series,\n   based on\n   *  public process and definition documents,\n \
    \  for which there are\n   *  clear responsibilities and mechanisms for update\
    \ and change.\n   Generally speaking, the RFC Editor is responsible for the operational\n\
    \   implementation of the RFC Series.  As outlined in Section 3.3, the\n   IETF\
    \ Executive Director provides the oversight of this operational\n   role.\n  \
    \ The process and definition documents are detailed below, including\n   responsibility\
    \ for the individual process documents (maintenance and\n   update).  The RFC\
    \ Editor works with the appropriate community to\n   ensure that the process documents\
    \ reflect current requirements.  The\n   IAB is charged with the role of verifying\
    \ that appropriate community\n   input has been sought and that any changes appropriately\
    \ account for\n   community requirements.\n   There are three categories of activity,\
    \ and a fourth category of\n   series-wide rules and guidelines, described for\
    \ implementing the RFC\n   Series to support its mission:\n   *  Approval of documents.\n\
    \   *  Editing, processing, and publication of documents.\n   *  Archiving and\
    \ indexing the documents and making them accessible.\n   *  Series rules and guidelines.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Document Approval
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Document Approval\n   The RFC Series mission implicitly requires that documents\
    \ be reviewed\n   and approved for acceptance into the series.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  Definition
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Definition\n   Section 5.1 describes the different streams of documents\
    \ that are put\n   to the RFC Editor for publication as RFCs today.  While there\
    \ may be\n   general policies for approval of documents as RFCs (to ensure the\n\
    \   coherence of the RFC Series), there are also policies defined for the\n  \
    \ approval of documents in each stream.  Generally speaking, there is a\n   different\
    \ approving body for each stream.  The current definitions\n   are catalogued\
    \ in Section 5.1.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Operational Implementation
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Operational Implementation\n   Each stream has its own documented approval\
    \ process.  The RFC Editor\n   is responsible for the approval of documents in\
    \ one of the streams\n   (Independent Submission stream, see Section 5.1.4) and\
    \ works with the\n   other approving bodies to ensure smooth passage of approved\
    \ documents\n   into the next phases, ultimately to publication and archiving\
    \ as an\n   RFC.\n"
- title: 4.1.3.  Process Change
  contents:
  - "4.1.3.  Process Change\n   From time to time, it may be necessary to change the\
    \ approval\n   processes for any given stream, or even add or remove streams.\
    \  This\n   may occur when the RFC Editor, the IAB, the body responsible for a\n\
    \   given stream of documents, or the community determines that there are\n  \
    \ issues to be resolved in general for RFC approval or for per-stream\n   approval\
    \ processes.\n   In this framework, the general approach is that the IAB will\
    \ work\n   with the RFC Editor and other parties to get community input, and it\n\
    \   will verify that any changes appropriately account for community\n   requirements.\n"

    \ Editor.  This is nothing new; however, over time the various\n   communities\
    \ and document requirements have grown and separated.  In\n   order to promote\
    \ harmony in discussing the collective set of\n   requirements, it is useful to\
    \ recognize each in their own space --\n   and they are referred to here as \"\
    streams\".\n   Note that by identifying separate streams, there is no intention\
    \ of\n   dividing them or undermining their management as one series.  Rather,\n\
    \   the opposite is true -- by clarifying the constituent parts, it is\n   easier\
    \ to make them work together without the friction that sometimes\n   arises when\
    \ discussing various requirements.\n   The subsections below identify the streams\
    \ that exist today.  There\n   is no immediate expectation of new streams being\
    \ created, and it is\n   preferable that new streams NOT be created.  Creation\
    \ of streams and\n   all policies surrounding general changes to the RFC Series\
    \ are\n   discussed above in Section 4.\n"
- title: 5.1.  RFC Approval Processes
  contents:
  - "5.1.  RFC Approval Processes\n   Processes for approval of documents (or requirements)\
    \ for each stream\n   are defined by the community that defines the stream.  The\
    \ IAB is\n   charged with the role of verifying that appropriate community input\n\
    \   has been sought and that the changes are consistent with the RFC\n   Series\
    \ mission and this overall framework.\n   The RFC Editor is expected to publish\
    \ all documents passed to it\n   after appropriate review and approval in one\
    \ of the identified\n   streams.\n"
- title: 5.1.1.  IETF Document Stream
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  IETF Document Stream\n   The IETF document stream includes IETF WG documents\
    \ as well as\n   \"individual submissions\" sponsored by an IESG area director.\
    \  Any\n   document being published as part of the IETF standards process must\n\
    \   follow this stream -- no other stream can approve Standards-Track\n   RFCs\
    \ or Best Current Practice (BCP) RFCs.\n   Approval of documents in the IETF stream\
    \ is defined by\n   *  the IETF standards process [RFC2026] (and its successors).\n\
    \   *  the IESG process for sponsoring individual submissions [SPONSOR].\n   Changes\
    \ to the approval process for this stream are made by updating\n   the IETF standards\

    \ stream is\n   defined to provide review and (possible) approval of documents\
    \ that\n   are outside the scope of the streams identified above.\n   Generally\
    \ speaking, approval of documents in this stream falls under\n   the purview of\
    \ the RFC Editor, and the RFC Editor seeks input to its\n   review from the IESG.\n\
    \   The process for reviewing and approving documents in the Independent\n   Submission\
    \ stream is defined by\n   *  Procedures for Rights Handling in the RFC Independent\

- title: 5.2.  RFC Technical Publication Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.2.  RFC Technical Publication Requirements\n   The Internet engineering and\
    \ research community has not only grown,\n   it has become more diverse, and sometimes\
    \ more demanding.  The IETF,\n   as a standards-developing organization, has publication\
    \ requirements\n   that extend beyond those of an academic journal.  The IAB does\
    \ not\n   have the same interdependence with IANA assignments as the IETF\n  \
    \ stream does.  Therefore, there is the need to both codify the\n   publishing\
    \ requirements of each stream, and endeavor to harmonize\n   them to the extent\
    \ that is reasonable.\n   Therefore, it is expected that the community of effort\
    \ behind each\n   document stream will outline their technical publication\n \
    \  requirements.\n   As part of the RFC Editor oversight, the IAB must agree that\
    \ the\n   requirements are consistent with and implementable as part of the RFC\n\
    \   Editor activity.\n"

    \ parties.  The archive of RFC documents, any source documents needed\n   to recreate\
    \ the RFC documents, and any associated original documents\n   (such as lists\
    \ of errata, tools, and, for some early items, non-\n   machine readable originals)\
