- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document discusses the nature of signals seen by on-path\n\
    \   elements examining transport protocols, contrasting implicit and\n   explicit\
    \ signals.  For example, TCP's state machine uses a series of\n   well-known messages\
    \ that are exchanged in the clear.  Because these\n   are visible to network elements\
    \ on the path between the two nodes\n   setting up the transport connection, they\
    \ are often used as signals\n   by those network elements.  While the architecture\
    \ of the Internet\n   may be best realized by end-to-end protocols [RFC1958],\
    \ there are\n   cases such as the use of Network Address Translators [RFC3234]\
    \ where\n   some functions are commonly provided by on-path network elements.\
    \  In\n   transports that do not exchange these messages in the clear, on-path\n\
    \   network elements lack those signals.  Often, the removal of those\n   signals\
    \ is intended by those moving the messages to confidential\n   channels.  Where\
    \ the endpoints desire that network elements along the\n   path receive these\
    \ signals, this document recommends explicit signals\n   be used.\n   The interpretation\
    \ of TCP [RFC0793] by on-path elements is an example\n   of implicit signal usage.\
    \  It uses cleartext handshake messages to\n   establish, maintain, and close\
    \ connections.  While these are\n   primarily intended to create state between\
    \ two communicating nodes,\n   these handshake messages are visible to network\
    \ elements along the\n   path between them.  It is common for certain network\
    \ elements to\n   treat the exchanged messages as signals that relate to their\
    \ own\n   functions.\n   A firewall may, for example, create a rule that allows\
    \ traffic from a\n   specific host and port to enter its network when the connection\
    \ was\n   initiated by a host already within the network.  It may subsequently\n\
    \   remove that rule when the communication has ceased.  In the context\n   of\
    \ TCP handshake, it sets up the pinhole rule on seeing the initial\n   TCP SYN\
    \ acknowledgement and then removes it upon seeing a RST or FIN\n   and ACK exchange.\
    \  Note that in this case, it does nothing to rewrite\n   any portion of the TCP\
    \ packet; it simply enables a return path that\n   would otherwise have been blocked.\n\
    \   When a transport encrypts the fields it uses for state mechanics,\n   these\
    \ signals are no longer accessible to path elements.  The\n   behavior of path\
    \ elements will then depend on which signal is not\n   available, on the default\
    \ behavior configured by the path element\n   administrator, and by the security\
    \ posture of the network as a whole.\n"
- title: 2.  Signal Types Inferred
  contents:
  - "2.  Signal Types Inferred\n   The following list of signals that may be inferred\
    \ from transport\n   state messages includes those that may be exchanged during\
    \ session\n   establishment and those that derive from the ongoing flow.\n   Some\
    \ of these signals are derived from the direct examination of\n   packet sequences,\
    \ such as using a sequence number gap pattern to\n   infer network reliability;\
    \ others are derived from association, such\n   as inferring network latency by\
    \ timing a flow's packet inter-arrival\n   times.\n   This list is not exhaustive,\
    \ and it is not the full set of effects\n   due to encrypting data and metadata\
    \ in flight.  Note as well that\n   because these are derived from inference,\
    \ they do not include any\n   path signals that would not be relevant to the endpoint\
    \ state\n   machines; indeed, an inference-based system cannot send such signals.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Session Establishment
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Session Establishment\n   One of the most basic inferences made by examination\
    \ of transport\n   state is that a packet will be part of an ongoing flow; that\
    \ is, an\n   established session will continue until messages are received that\n\
    \   terminate it.  Path elements may then make subsidiary inferences\n   related\
    \ to the session.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Session Identity
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Session Identity\n   Path elements that track session establishment will\
    \ typically create\n   a session identity for the flow, commonly using a tuple\
    \ of the\n   visible information in the packet headers.  This is then used to\n\
    \   associate other information with the flow.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Routability and Intent
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Routability and Intent\n   A second common inference that session establishment\
    \ provides is that\n   the communicating pair of hosts can each reach each other\
    \ and are\n   interested in continuing communication.  The firewall example given\n\
    \   above is a consequence of that inference; because the internal host\n   initiates\
    \ the connection, it is presumed to want to receive return\n   traffic.  That,\
    \ in turn, justifies the pinhole.\n   Some other on-path elements assume that\
    \ a host that asked to\n   communicate with a remote address has authorized receiving\
    \ incoming\n   communications from any other host (e.g., Endpoint-Independent\n\
    \   Mapping or Endpoint-Independent Filtering [RFC7857]).  This is, for\n   example,\
    \ the default behavior in Network Address and Protocol\n   Translation from IPv6\
    \ Clients to IPv4 Servers (NAT64).\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  Flow Stability
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Flow Stability\n   Some on-path devices that are responsible for load-sharing\
    \ or load-\n   balancing may be instructed to preserve the same path for a given\n\
    \   flow rather than dispatching packets belonging to the same flow on\n   multiple\
    \ paths as this may cause packets in the flow to be delivered\n   out of order.\n"
- title: 2.1.4.  Resource Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1.4.  Resource Requirements\n   An additional common inference is that network\
    \ resources will be\n   required for the session.  These may be requirements within\
    \ the\n   network element itself, such as table entry space for a firewall or\n\
    \   NAT; they may also be communicated by the network element to other\n   systems.\
    \  For networks that use resource reservations, this might\n   result in reservation\
    \ of radio air time, energy, or network capacity.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Network Measurement
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Network Measurement\n   Some network elements will also observe transport\
    \ messages to engage\n   in measurement of the paths that are used by flows on\
    \ their network.\n   The list of measurements below is illustrative, not exhaustive.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Path Latency
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Path Latency\n   There are several ways in which a network element may\
    \ measure path\n   latency using transport messages, but two common ones are examining\n\
    \   exposed timestamps and associating sequence numbers with a local\n   timer.\
    \  These measurements are necessarily limited to measuring only\n   the portion\
    \ of the path between the system that assigned the\n   timestamp or sequence number\
    \ and the network element.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Path Reliability and Consistency
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Path Reliability and Consistency\n   A network element may also measure\
    \ the reliability of a particular\n   path by examining sessions that expose sequence\
    \ numbers;\n   retransmissions and gaps are then associated with the path segments\n\
    \   on which they might have occurred.\n"
- title: 3.  Options
  contents:
  - "3.  Options\n   The set of options below are alternatives that optimize very\n\
    \   different things.  Though it comes to a preliminary conclusion, this\n   document\
    \ intends to foster a discussion of those trade-offs, and any\n   discussion of\
    \ them must be understood as preliminary.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Do Not Restore These Signals
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Do Not Restore These Signals\n   It is possible, of course, to do nothing.\
    \  The transport messages\n   were not necessarily intended for consumption by\
    \ on-path network\n   elements, and encrypting them so they are not visible may\
    \ be taken by\n   some as a benefit.  Each network element would then treat packets\n\
    \   without these visible elements according to its own defaults.  While\n   our\
    \ experience of that is not extensive, one consequence has been\n   that state\
    \ tables for flows of this type are generally not kept as\n   long as those for\
    \ which sessions are identifiable.  The result is\n   that heartbeat traffic must\
    \ be maintained to keep any bindings (e.g.,\n   NAT or firewall) from early expiry.\
    \  When those bindings are not\n   kept, methods like a QUIC connection-id [QUIC]\
    \ may be necessary to\n   allow load balancers or other systems to continue to\
    \ maintain a\n   flow's path to the appropriate peer.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Replace These with Network-Layer Signals
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Replace These with Network-Layer Signals\n   It would be possible to replace\
    \ these implicit signals with explicit\n   signals at the network layer.  Though\
    \ IPv4 has relatively few\n   facilities for this, IPv6 hop-by-hop headers [RFC7045]\
    \ might suit\n   this purpose.  Further examination of the deployability of these\n\
    \   headers may be required.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Replace These with Per-Transport Signals
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Replace These with Per-Transport Signals\n   It is possible to replace\
    \ these implicit signals with signals that\n   are tailored to specific transports,\
    \ just as the initial signals are\n   derived primarily from TCP.  There is a\
    \ risk here that the first\n   transport that develops these will be reused for\
    \ many purposes\n   outside its stated purpose, simply because it traverses NATs\
    \ and\n   firewalls better than other traffic.  If done with an explicit intent\n\
    \   to reuse the elements of the solution in other transports, the risk\n   of\
    \ ossification might be slightly lower.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Create a Set of Signals Common to Multiple Transports
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Create a Set of Signals Common to Multiple Transports\n   Several proposals\
    \ use UDP [RFC0768] as a demux layer, onto which new\n   transport semantics are\
    \ layered.  For those transports, it may be\n   possible to build a common signaling\
    \ mechanism and set of signals,\n   such as that proposed in \"Transport-Independent\
    \ Path Layer State\n   Management\" [PLUS].\n   This may be taken as a variant\
    \ of the reuse of common elements\n   mentioned in the section above, but it has\
    \ a greater chance of\n   avoiding the ossification of the solution into the first\
    \ moving\n   protocol.\n"
- title: 4.  Recommendation
  contents:
  - "4.  Recommendation\n   The IAB urges protocol designers to design for confidential\
    \ operation\n   by default.  We strongly encourage developers to include encryption\n\
    \   in their implementations and to make them encrypted by default.  We\n   similarly\
    \ encourage network and service operators to deploy\n   encryption where it is\
    \ not yet deployed, and we urge firewall policy\n   administrators to permit encrypted\
    \ traffic.  One of the consequences\n   of the change will be the loss of implicit\
    \ signals.\n   Fundamentally, this document recommends that implicit signals should\n\
    \   be avoided and that an implicit signal should be replaced with an\n   explicit\
    \ signal only when the signal's originator intends that it be\n   used by the\
    \ network elements on the path.  For many flows, this may\n   result in the signal\
    \ being absent but allows it to be present when\n   needed.\n   Discussion of\
    \ the appropriate mechanism(s) for these signals is\n   continuing, but at a minimum,\
    \ any method should aim to adhere to\n   these basic principles:\n   o  The portion\
    \ of protocol signaling that is intended for end-system\n      state machines\
    \ should be protected by confidentiality and\n      integrity protection such\
    \ that it is only available to those end\n      systems.\n   o  Anything exposed\
    \ to the path should be done with the intent that\n      it be used by the network\
    \ elements on the path.  This information\n      should be integrity protected,\
    \ so that end systems can detect if\n      path elements have made changes in\
    \ flight.\n   o  Signals exposed to the path should be decoupled from signals\
    \ that\n      drive the protocol state machines in endpoints.  This avoids\n \
    \     creating opportunities for additional inference.\n   o  Intermediate path\
    \ elements should not add visible signals that\n      identify the user, origin\
    \ node, or origin network [RFC8164].  Note\n      that if integrity protection\
    \ is provided as suggested above, any\n      signals added by intermediate path\
    \ elements will be clearly\n      distinguishable from those added by endpoints,\
    \ as they will not be\n      within the integrity-protected portion of the packet.\n\
    \   The IAB notes that methods for allowing on-path actors to verify\n   integrity\
    \ protection are not available unless those actors have\n   shared keys with the\
    \ end systems or share a common set of trust\n   points.  As a result, integrity\
    \ protection can generally be reliably\n   applied by and verified only by endpoints.\n\
    \   Verifying the authenticity of signals generated by on-path actors is\n   similarly\
    \ difficult.  Endpoints that consume signals generated by\n   on-path actors,\
    \ particularly where those signals are unauthenticated,\n   need to fully consider\
    \ the implications of doing so.  Managing the\n   authentication of on-path signals\
    \ is an area of active research, and\n   defining or recommending methods for\
    \ it is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Path-visible signals allow network elements along\
    \ the path to act\n   based on the signaled information, whether the signal is\
    \ implicit or\n   explicit.  If the network element is controlled by an attacker,\
    \ those\n   actions can include dropping, delaying, or mishandling the\n   constituent\
    \ packets of a flow.  An attacker may also characterize the\n   flow or attempt\
    \ to fingerprint the communicating nodes based on the\n   pattern of signals.\n\
    \   Note that actions that do not benefit the flow or the network may be\n   perceived\
    \ as an attack even if they are conducted by a responsible\n   network element.\
    \  Designing a system that minimizes the ability to\n   act on signals at all\
    \ by removing as many signals as possible may\n   reduce this possibility.  This\
    \ approach also comes with risks,\n   principally that the actions will continue\
    \ to take place on an\n   arbitrary set of flows.\n   Addition of visible signals\
    \ to the path also increases the\n   information available to an observer and\
    \ may, when the information\n   can be linked to a node or user, reduce the privacy\
    \ of the user.\n   When signals from endpoints to the path are independent from\
    \ the\n   signals used by endpoints to manage the flow's state mechanics, they\n\
    \   may be falsified by an endpoint without affecting the peer's\n   understanding\
    \ of the flow's state.  For encrypted flows, this\n   divergence is not detectable\
    \ by on-path devices.  The intent of this\n   practice may be to garner improved\
    \ treatment from the network or to\n   avoid strictures.  Protocol designers should\
    \ be cautious when\n   introducing explicit signals to consider how falsified\
    \ signals would\n   impact protocol operation and deployment.  Similarly, operators\n\
    \   should be cautious in deployments to be sure that default operation\n   without\
    \ these signals does not encourage gaming the system by\n   providing false signals.\n"
