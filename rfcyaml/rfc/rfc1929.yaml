  - "1.  Introduction\n   The protocol specification for SOCKS Version 5 specifies
    a\n   generalized framework for the use of arbitrary authentication\n   protocols
    in the initial socks connection setup. This document\n   describes one of those
    protocols, as it fits into the SOCKS Version 5\n   authentication \"subnegotiation\".\n"
  - "Note:\n   Unless otherwise noted, the decimal numbers appearing in packet-\n
    \  format diagrams represent the length of the corresponding field, in\n   octets.
    \ Where a given octet must take on a specific value, the\n   syntax X'hh' is used
    to denote the value of the single octet in that\n   field. When the word 'Variable'
    is used, it indicates that the\n   corresponding field has a variable length defined
    either by an\n   associated (one or two octet) length field, or by a data type
    field.\n"

  - "2.  Initial negotiation\n   Once the SOCKS V5 server has started, and the client
    has selected the\n   Username/Password Authentication protocol, the Username/Password\n
    \  subnegotiation begins.  This begins with the client producing a\n   Username/Password
    request:\n           |VER | ULEN |  UNAME   | PLEN |  PASSWD  |\n           |
    1  |  1   | 1 to 255 |  1   | 1 to 255 |\n   The VER field contains the current
    version of the subnegotiation,\n   which is X'01'. The ULEN field contains the
    length of the UNAME field\n   that follows. The UNAME field contains the username
    as known to the\n   source operating system. The PLEN field contains the length
    of the\n   PASSWD field that follows. The PASSWD field contains the password\n
    \  association with the given UNAME.\n   The server verifies the supplied UNAME
    and PASSWD, and sends the\n   following response:\n                        +----+--------+\n
    \                       |VER | STATUS |\n                        +----+--------+\n
    \                       | 1  |   1    |\n                        +----+--------+\n
    \  A STATUS field of X'00' indicates success. If the server returns a\n   `failure'
    (STATUS value other than X'00') status, it MUST close the\n   connection.\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes a subnegotiation that
    provides authentication\n   services to the SOCKS protocol. Since the request
    carries the\n   password in cleartext, this subnegotiation is not recommended
    for\n   environments where \"sniffing\" is possible and practical.\n"
