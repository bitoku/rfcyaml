  - "1. Introduction\n   Clients obtain Internet services by negotiating a point of\
    \ attachment\n   to a \"home domain\", generally from an ISP, or other organization\
    \ from\n   which service requests are made, and fulfilled.  With the increasing\n\
    \   popularity of mobile devices, a need has been generated to allow\n   users\
    \ to attach to any domain convenient to their current location.\n   In this way,\
    \ a client needs access to resources being provided by an\n   administrative domain\
    \ different than their home domain (called a\n   \"foreign domain\").  The need\
    \ for service from a foreign domain\n   requires, in many models, Authorization,\
    \ which leads directly to\n   Authentication, and of course Accounting (whence,\
    \ \"AAA\").  There is\n   some argument which of these leads to, or is derived\
    \ from the others,\n   but there is common agreement that the three AAA functions\
    \ are\n   closely interdependent.\n   An agent in a foreign domain, being called\
    \ on to provide access to a\n   resource by a mobile user, is likely to request\
    \ or require the client\n   to provide credentials which can be authenticated\
    \ before access to\n   resources is permitted.  The resource may be as simple\
    \ as a conduit\n   to the Internet, or may be as complex as access to specific\
    \ private\n   resources within the foreign domain.  Credentials can be exchanged\
    \ in\n   many different ways, all of which are beyond the scope of this\n   document.\
    \  Once authenticated, the mobile user may be authorized to\n   access services\
    \ within the foreign domain.  An accounting of the\n   actual resources may then\
    \ be assembled.\n   Mobile IP is a technology that allows a network node (\"mobile\
    \ node\")\n   to migrate from its \"home\" network to other networks, either within\n\
    \   the same administrative domain, or to other administrative domains.\n   The\
    \ possibility of movement between domains which require AAA\n   services has created\
    \ an immediate demand to design and specify AAA\n   protocols.  Once available,\
    \ the AAA protocols and infrastructure will\n   provide the economic incentive\
    \ for a wide-ranging deployment of\n   Mobile IP. This document will identify,\
    \ describe, and discuss the\n   functional and performance requirements that Mobile\
    \ IP places on AAA\n   protocols.\n   The formal description of Mobile IP can\
    \ be found in [13,12,14,17].\n   In this document, we have attempted to exhibit\
    \ requirements in a\n   progressive fashion.  After showing the basic AAA model\
    \ for Mobile\n   IP, we derive requirements as follows:\n   -  requirements based\
    \ on the general model\n   -  requirements based on providing IP service for mobile\
    \ nodes\n   -  requirements derived from specific Mobile IP protocol needs\n \
    \  Then, we exhibit some related AAA models and describe requirements\n   derived\
    \ from the related models.\n"

    \                   The act of verifying a claimed identity, in the form\n   \
    \                of a pre-existing label from a mutually known name\n        \
    \           space, as the originator of a message (message\n                 \
    \  authentication) or as the end-point of a channel\n                   (entity\

    \   administrative domain, for use within another\n                   administrative\
    \ domain.  In inter-domain accounting,\n                   accounting packets\

- title: 3. Basic Model
  contents:
  - "3. Basic Model\n   In this section, we attempt to capture the main features of\
    \ a basic\n   model for operation of AAA servers that seems to have good support\n\
    \   within the Mobile IP working group.  Within the Internet, a client\n   belonging\
    \ to one administrative domain (called the home domain) often\n   needs to use\
    \ resources provided by another administrative domain\n   (called the foreign\
    \ domain).  An agent in the foreign domain that\n   attends to the client's request\
    \ (call the agent the \"attendant\") is\n   likely to require that the client\
    \ provide some credentials that can\n   be authenticated before access to the\
    \ resources is permitted.  These\n   credentials may be something the foreign\
    \ domain understands, but in\n   most cases they are assigned by, and understood\
    \ only by the home\n   domain, and may be used for setting up secure channels\
    \ with the\n   mobile node.\n                   Local Domain                 \

    \       Figure 1: AAA Servers in Home and Local Domains\n   The attendant often\
    \ does not have direct access to the data needed to\n   complete the transaction.\
    \  Instead, the attendant is expected to\n   consult an authority (typically in\
    \ the same foreign domain) in order\n   to request proof that the client has acceptable\
    \ credentials.  Since\n   the attendant and the local authority are part of the\
    \ same\n   administrative domain, they are expected to have established, or be\n\
    \   able to establish for the necessary lifetime, a secure channel for\n   the\
    \ purposes of exchanging sensitive (access) information, and\n   keeping it private\
    \ from (at least) the visiting mobile node.\n   The local authority (AAAL) itself\
    \ may not have enough information\n   stored locally to carry out the verification\
    \ for the credentials of\n   the client.  In contrast to the attendant, however,\
    \ the AAAL is\n   expected to be configured with enough information to negotiate\
    \ the\n   verification of client credentials with external authorities.  The\n\
    \   local and the external authorities should be configured with\n   sufficient\
    \ security relationships and access controls so that they,\n   possibly without\
    \ the need for any other AAA agents, can negotiate the\n   authorization that\
    \ may enable the client to have access to any/all\n   requested resources.  In\
    \ many typical cases, the authorization\n   depends only upon secure authentication\
    \ of the client's credentials.\n   Once the authorization has been obtained by\
    \ the local authority, and\n   the authority has notified the attendant about\
    \ the successful\n   negotiation, the attendant can provide the requested resources\
    \ to the\n   client.\n   In the picture, there might be many attendants for each\
    \ AAAL, and\n   there might be many clients from many different Home Domains.\
    \  Each\n   Home Domain provides a AAAH that can check credentials originating\n\
    \   from clients administered by that Home Domain.\n   There is a security model\
    \ implicit in the above figure, and it is\n   crucial to identify the specific\
    \ security associations assumed in the\n   security model.\n   First, it is natural\
    \ to assume that the client has a security\n   association with the AAAH, since\
    \ that is roughly what it means for\n   the client to belong to the home domain.\n\
    \   Second, from the model illustrated in figure 1 it is clear that AAAL\n   and\
    \ AAAH have to share a security association, because otherwise they\n   could\
    \ not rely on the authentication results, authorizations, nor\n   even the accounting\
    \ data which might be transacted between them.\n   Requiring such bilateral security\
    \ relationships is, however, in the\n   end not scalable; the AAA framework MUST\
    \ provide for more scalable\n   mechanisms, as suggested below in section 6.\n\
    \   Finally, in the figure, it is clear that the attendant can naturally\n   share\
    \ a security association with the AAAL.  This is necessary in\n   order for the\
    \ model to work because the attendant has to know that it\n   is permissible to\
    \ allocate the local resources to the client.\n   As an example in today's Internet,\
    \ we can cite the deployment of\n   RADIUS [16] to allow mobile computer clients\
    \ to have access to the\n   Internet by way of a local ISP. The ISP wants to make\
    \ sure that the\n   mobile client can pay for the connection.  Once the client\
    \ has\n   provided credentials (e.g., identification, unique data, and an\n  \
    \ unforgeable signature), the ISP checks with the client's home\n   authority\
    \ to verify the signature, and to obtain assurance that the\n   client will pay\
    \ for the connection.  Here, the attendant function can\n   be carried out by\
    \ the NAS, and the local and home authorities can use\n   RADIUS servers.  Credentials\
    \ allowing authorization at one attendant\n   SHOULD be unusable in any future\
    \ negotiations at the same or any\n   other attendant.\n   From the description\
    \ and example above, we can identify several\n   requirements.\n   -  Each local\
    \ attendant has to have a security relationship with the\n      local AAA server\
    \ (AAAL)\n   -  The local authority has to share, or dynamically establish,\n\
    \      security relationships with external authorities that are able to\n   \
    \   check client credentials\n   -  The attendant has to keep state for pending\
    \ client requests while\n      the local authority contacts the appropriate external\
    \ authority\n   -  Since the mobile node may not necessarily initiate network\n\
    \      connectivity from within its home domain, it MUST be able to\n      provide\
    \ complete, yet unforgeable credentials without ever having\n      been in touch\
    \ with its home domain.\n   -  Since the mobile node's credentials have to remain\
    \ unforgeable,\n      intervening nodes (e.g., neither the attendant or the local\n\
    \      authority (AAAL) or any other intermediate nodes) MUST NOT be able\n  \
    \    to learn any (secret) information which may enable them to\n      reconstruct\
    \ and reuse the credentials.\n   From this last requirement, we can see the reasons\
    \ for the natural\n   requirement that the client has to share, or dynamically\
    \ establish, a\n   security relationship with the external authority in the Home\
    \ Domain.\n   Otherwise, it is technically infeasible (given the implied network\n\
    \   topology) for the client to produce unforgeable signatures that can\n   be\
    \ checked by the AAAH.  Figure 2 illustrates the natural security\n   associations\
    \ we understand from our proposed model.  Note that,\n   according to the discussion\
    \ in section 6, there may, by mutual\n   agreement between AAAL and AAAH, be a\
    \ third party inserted between\n   AAAL and AAAH to help them arbitrate secure\
    \ transactions in a more\n   scalable fashion.\n                             \

    \       +------+\n                    Figure 2: Security Associations\n   In addition\
    \ to the requirements listed above, we specify the\n   following requirements\
    \ which derive from operational experience with\n   today's roaming protocols.\n\
    \   -  There are scenarios in which an attendant will have to manage\n      requests\
    \ for many clients at the same time.\n   -  The attendant MUST protect against\
    \ replay attacks.\n   -  The attendant equipment should be as inexpensive as possible,\n\
    \      since it will be replicated as many times as possible to handle as\n  \
    \    many clients as possible in the foreign domain.\n   -  Attendants SHOULD\
    \ be configured to obtain authorization, from a\n      trusted local AAA server\
    \ (AAAL) for Quality of Service\n      requirements placed by the client.\n  \
    \ Nodes in two separate administrative domains (for instance, AAAH and\n   AAAL)\
    \ often must take additional steps to verify the identity of\n   their communication\
    \ partners, or alternatively to guarantee the\n   privacy of the data making up\
    \ the communication.  While these\n   considerations lead to important security\
    \ requirements, as mentioned\n   above in the context of security between servers,\
    \ we consider the\n   exact choice of security associations between the AAA servers\
    \ to be\n   beyond the scope of this document.  The choices are unlikely even\
    \ to\n   depend upon any specific features of the general model illustrated in\n\
    \   figure 1.  On the other hand, the security associations needed\n   between\
    \ Mobile IP entities will be of central importance in the\n   design of a suitable\
    \ AAA infrastructure for Mobile IP.  The general\n   model shown above is generally\
    \ compatible with the needs of Mobile\n   IP. However, some basic changes are\
    \ needed in the security model of\n   Mobile IP, as detailed in section 5.\n \
    \  Lastly, recent discussion in the mobile-ip working group has\n   indicated\
    \ that the attendant MUST be able to terminate service to the\n   client based\
    \ on policy determination by either AAAH or AAAL server.\n"
- title: 3.1. AAA Protocol Roaming Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1. AAA Protocol Roaming Requirements\n   In this section we will detail additional\
    \ requirements based on\n   issues discovered through operational experience of\
    \ existing roaming\n   RADIUS networks.  The AAA protocol MUST satisfy these requirements\
    \ in\n   order for providers to offer a robust service.  These requirements\n\
    \   have been identified by TR45.6 as part of their involvement with the\n   Mobile\
    \ IP working group.\n   -  Support a reliable AAA transport mechanism.\n     \
    \ *  There must be an effective hop-by-hop retransmission and\n         failover\
    \ mechanism so that reliability does not solely depend\n         on end-to-end\
    \ retransmission\n      *  This transport mechanism will be able indicate to an\
    \ AAA\n         application that a message was delivered to the next peer AAA\n\
    \         application or that a time out occurred.\n      *  Retransmission is\
    \ controlled by the reliable AAA transport\n         mechanism, and not by lower\
    \ layer protocols such as TCP.\n      *  Even if the AAA message is to be forwarded,\
    \ or the message's\n         options or semantics do not conform with the AAA\
    \ protocol, the\n         transport mechanism will acknowledge that the peer received\
    \ the\n         AAA message.\n      *  Acknowledgements SHOULD be allowed to be\
    \ piggybacked in AAA\n         messages\n      *  AAA responses have to be delivered\
    \ in a timely fashion so that\n         Mobile IP does not timeout and retransmit\n\
    \   -  Transport a digital certificate in an AAA message, in order to\n      minimize\

    \ certificates could be used by\n      foreign and home agents to establish an\
    \ IPSec security association\n      to secure the mobile node's tunneled data.\

  - "4. Requirements related to basic IP connectivity\n   The requirements listed\
    \ in the previous section pertain to the\n   relationships between the functional\
    \ units, and don't depend on the\n   underlying network addressing.  On the other\
    \ hand, many nodes (mobile\n   or merely portable) are programmed to receive some\
    \ IP-specific\n   resources during the initialization phase of their attempt to\
    \ connect\n   to the Internet.\n   We place the following additional requirements\
    \ on the AAA services in\n   order to satisfy such clients.\n   -  Either AAA\
    \ server MUST be able to obtain, or to coordinate the\n      allocation of, a\
    \ suitable IP address for the customer, upon\n      request by the customer.\n\
    \   -  AAA servers MUST be able to identify the client by some means\n      other\
    \ than its IP address.\n   Policy in the home domain may dictate that the home\
    \ agent instead of\n   the AAAH manages the allocation of an IP address for the\
    \ mobile node.\n   AAA servers MUST be able to coordinate the allocation of an\
    \ IP\n   address for the mobile node at least in this way.\n   AAA servers today\
    \ identify clients by using the Network Access\n   Identifier (NAI) [1].  A mobile\
    \ node can identify itself by including\n   the NAI along with the Mobile IP Registration\
    \ Request [6].  The NAI\n   is of the form \"user@realm\"; it is unique and well\
    \ suited for use in\n   the AAA model illustrated in figure 1.  Using a NAI (e.g.,\n\
    \   \"user@realm\") allows AAAL to easily determine the home domain (e.g.,\n \
    \  \"realm\") for the client.  Both the AAAL and the AAAH can use the NAI\n  \
    \ to keep records indexed by the client's specific identity.\n"
- title: 5. AAA for Mobile IP
  contents:
  - "5. AAA for Mobile IP\n   Clients using Mobile IP require specific features from\
    \ the AAA\n   services, in addition to the requirements already mentioned in\n\
    \   connection with the basic AAA functionality and what is needed for IP\n  \
    \ connectivity.  To understand the application of the general model for\n   Mobile\
    \ IP, we consider the mobile node (MN) to be the client in\n   figure 1, and the\
    \ attendant to be the foreign agent (FA).  If a\n   situation arises that there\
    \ is no foreign agent present, e.g., in the\n   case of an IPv4 mobile node with\
    \ a co-located care of address or an\n   IPv6 mobile node, the equivalent attendant\
    \ functionality is to be\n   provided by the address allocation entity, e.g.,\
    \ a DHCP server.  Such\n   an attendant functionality is outside the scope of\
    \ this document.\n   The home agent, while important to Mobile IP, is allowed\
    \ to play a\n   role during the initial registration that is subordinate to the\
    \ role\n   played by the AAAH. For application to Mobile IP, we modify the\n \
    \  general model (as illustrated in figure 3).  After the initial\n   registration,\
    \ the mobile node is authorized to continue using Mobile\n   IP at the foreign\
    \ domain without requiring further involvement by the\n   AAA servers.  Thus,\
    \ the initial registration will probably take\n   longer than subsequent Mobile\
    \ IP registrations.\n   In order to reduce this extra time overhead as much as\
    \ possible, it\n   is important to reduce the time taken for communications between\
    \ the\n   AAA servers.  A major component of this communications latency is the\n\
    \   time taken to traverse the wide-area Internet that is likely to\n   separate\
    \ the AAAL and the AAAH.  This leads to a further strong\n   motivation for integration\
    \ of the AAA functions themselves, as well\n   as integration of AAA functions\
    \ with the initial Mobile IP\n   registration.  In order to reduce the number\
    \ of messages that\n   traverse the network for initial registration of a Mobile\
    \ Node, the\n   AAA functions in the visited network (AAAL) and the home network\n\
    \   (AAAH) need to interface with the foreign agent and the home agent to\n  \
    \ handle the registration message.  Latency would be reduced as a\n   result of\
    \ initial registration being handled in conjunction with AAA\n   and the mobile\
    \ IP mobility agents.  Subsequent registrations,\n   however, would be handled\
    \ according to RFC 2002 [13].  Another way to\n   reduce latency as to accounting\
    \ would be the exchange of small\n   records.\n   As there are many different\
    \ types of sub-services attendants may\n   provide to mobile clients, there MUST\
    \ be extensible accounting\n   formats.  In this way, the specific services being\
    \ provided can be\n   identified, as well as accounting support should more services\
    \ be\n   identified in the future.\n   The AAA home domain and the HA home domain\
    \ of the mobile node need\n   not be part of the same administrative domain. \
    \ Such an situation can\n   occur if the home address of the mobile node is provided\
    \ by one\n   domain, e.g., an ISP that the mobile user uses while at home, and\
    \ the\n   authorization and accounting by another (specialized) domain, e.g.,\
    \ a\n   credit card company.  The foreign agent sends only the authentication\n\
    \   information of the mobile node to the AAAL, which interfaces to the\n   AAAH.\
    \ After a successful authorization of the mobile node, the\n   foreign agent is\
    \ able to continue with the mobile IP registration\n   procedure.  Such a scheme\
    \ introduces more delay if the access to the\n   AAA functionality and the mobile\
    \ IP protocol is sequentialized.\n   Subsequent registrations would be handled\
    \ according to RFC 2002 [13]\n   without further interaction with the AAA. Whether\
    \ to combine or\n   separate the Mobile IP protocol data with/from the AAA messages\
    \ is\n   ultimately a policy decision.  A separation of the Mobile IP protocol\n\
    \   data and the AAA messages can be successfully accomplished only if\n   the\
    \ IP address of the mobile node's home agent is provided to the\n   foreign agent\
    \ performing the attendant function.\n   All needed AAA and Mobile IP functions\
    \ SHOULD be processed during a\n   single Internet traversal.  This MUST be done\
    \ without requiring AAA\n   servers to process protocol messages sent to Mobile\
    \ IP agents.  The\n   AAA servers MUST identify the Mobile IP agents and security\n\
    \   associations necessary to process the Mobile IP registration, pass\n   the\
    \ necessary registration data to those Mobile IP agents, and remain\n   uninvolved\
    \ in the routing and authentication processing steps\n   particular to Mobile\
    \ IP registration.\n   For Mobile IP, the AAAL and the AAAH servers have the following\n\
    \   additional general tasks:\n   - enable [re]authentication for Mobile IP registration\n\
    \   -  authorize the mobile node (once its identity has been established)\n  \
    \    to use at least the set of resources for minimal Mobile IP\n      functionality,\
    \ plus potentially other services requested by the\n      mobile node\n   -  initiate\
    \ accounting for service utilization\n   -  use AAA protocol extensions specifically\
    \ for including Mobile IP\n      registration messages as part of the initial\
    \ registration sequence\n      to be handled by the AAA servers.\n   These tasks,\
    \ and the resulting more specific tasks to be listed later\n   in this section,\
    \ are beneficially handled and expedited by the AAA\n   servers shown in figure\
    \ 1 because the tasks often happen together,\n   and task processing needs access\
    \ to the same data at the same time.\n                   Local Domain        \

    \  Figure 3: AAA Servers with Mobile IP agents\n   In the model in figure 1, the\
    \ initial AAA transactions are handled\n   without needing the home agent, but\
    \ Mobile IP requires every\n   registration to be handled between the home agent\
    \ (HA) and the\n   foreign agent (FA), as shown by the sparse dashed (lower) line\
    \ in\n   figure 3.  This means that during the initial registration, something\n\
    \   has to happen that enables the home agent and foreign agent to\n   perform\
    \ subsequent Mobile IP registrations.  After the initial\n   registration, the\
    \ AAAH and AAAL in figure 3 would not be needed, and\n   subsequent Mobile IP\
    \ registrations would only follow the lower\n   control path between the foreign\
    \ agent and the home agent.\n   Any Mobile IP data that is sent by FA through\
    \ the AAAL to AAAH MUST\n   be considered opaque to the AAA servers.  Authorization\
    \ data needed\n   by the AAA servers then MUST be delivered to them by the foreign\n\
    \   agent from the data supplied by the mobile node.  The foreign agent\n   becomes\
    \ a translation agent between the Mobile IP registration\n   protocol and AAA.\n\
    \   As mentioned in section 3, nodes in two separate administrative\n   domains\
    \ often must take additional steps to guarantee their security\n   and privacy,,\
    \ as well as the security and privacy of the data they\n   are exchanging.  In\
    \ today's Internet, such security measures may be\n   provided by using several\
    \ different algorithms.  Some algorithms rely\n   on the existence of a public-key\
    \ infrastructure [8]; others rely on\n   distribution of symmetric keys to the\
    \ communicating nodes [9].  AAA\n   servers SHOULD be able to verify credentials\
    \ using either style in\n   their interactions with Mobile IP entities.\n   In\
    \ order to enable subsequent registrations, the AAA servers MUST be\n   able to\
    \ perform some key distribution during the initial Mobile IP\n   registration\
    \ process from any particular administrative domain.\n   This key distribution\
    \ MUST be able to provide the following security\n   functions:\n   -  identify\
    \ or create a security association between MN and home\n      agent (HA); this\
    \ is required for the MN to produce the\n      [re]authentication data for the\
    \ MN--HA authentication extension,\n      which is mandatory on Mobile IP registrations.\n\
    \   -  identify or create a security association between mobile node and\n   \
    \   foreign agent, for use with subsequent registrations at the same\n      foreign\
    \ agent, so that the foreign agent can continue to obtain\n      assurance that\
    \ the same mobile node has requested the continued\n      authorization for Mobile\
    \ IP services.\n   -  identify or create a security association between home agent\
    \ and\n      foreign agent, for use with subsequent registrations at the same\n\
    \      foreign agent, so that the foreign agent can continue to obtain\n     \
    \ assurance that the same home agent has continued the authorization\n      for\
    \ Mobile IP services for the mobile node.\n   -  participate in the distribution\
    \ of the security association (and\n      Security Parameter Index, or SPI) to\
    \ the Mobile IP entities\n   -  The AAA server MUST also be able to validate certificates\
    \ provided\n      by the mobile node and provide reliable indication to the foreign\n\
    \      agent.\n   -  The AAAL SHOULD accept an indication from the foreign agent\
    \ about\n      the acceptable lifetime for its security associations with the\n\
    \      mobile node and/or the mobile node's home agent.  This lifetime\n     \
    \ for those security associations SHOULD be an integer multiple of\n      registration\
    \ lifetime offered by the foreign agent to the mobile\n      node.  This MAY allow\
    \ for Mobile IP reauthentication to take place\n      without the need for reauthentication\
    \ to take place on the AAA\n      level, thereby shortenning the time required\
    \ for mobile node\n      reregistration.\n   -  The AAA servers SHOULD be able\
    \ to condition their acceptance of a\n      Mobile IP registration authorization\
    \ depending upon whether the\n      registration requires broadcast or multicast\
    \ service to the mobile\n      node tunneled through the foreign agent.\n   -\
    \  In addition, reverse tunneling may also be a necessary requirement\n      for\
    \ mobile node connectivity.  Therefore, AAA servers SHOULD also\n      be able\
    \ to condition their acceptance of Mobile IP registration\n      authorization\
    \ depending upon whether the registration requires\n      reverse tunnelling support\
    \ to the home domain through the foreign\n      agent.\n   The lifetime of any\
    \ security associations distributed by the AAA\n   server for use with Mobile\
    \ IP SHOULD be great enough to avoid too-\n   frequent initiation of the AAA key\
    \ distribution, since each\n   invocation of this process is likely to cause lengthy\
    \ delays between\n   [re]registrations [5].  Registration delays in Mobile IP\
    \ cause\n   dropped packets and noticeable disruptions in service.  Note that\
    \ any\n   key distributed by AAAH to the foreign agent and home agent MAY be\n\
    \   used to initiate Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [7].\n   Note further that the\
    \ mobile node and home agent may well have a\n   security association established\
    \ that does not depend upon any action\n   by the AAAH.\n"
- title: 5.1. Mobile IP with Dynamic IP Addresses
  contents:
  - "5.1. Mobile IP with Dynamic IP Addresses\n   According to section 4, many people\
    \ would like their mobile nodes to\n   be identified by their NAI, and to obtain\
    \ a dynamically allocated\n   home address for use in the foreign domain.  These\
    \ people may often\n   be unconcerned with details about how their computers implement\n\
    \   Mobile IP, and indeed may not have any knowledge of their home agent\n   or\
    \ any security association except that between themselves and the\n   AAAH (see\
    \ figure 2).  In this case the Mobile IP registration data\n   has to be carried\
    \ along with the AAA messages.  The AAA home domain\n   and the HA home domain\
    \ have to be part of the same administrative\n   domain.\n   Mobile IP requires\
    \ the home address assigned to the mobile node\n   belong to the same subnet as\
    \ the Home Agent providing service to the\n   mobile node.  For effective use\
    \ of IP home addresses, the home AAA\n   (AAAH) SHOULD be able to select a home\
    \ agent for use with the newly\n   allocated home address.  In many cases, the\
    \ mobile node will already\n   know the address of its home agent, even if the\
    \ mobile node does not\n   already have an existing home address.  Therefore,\
    \ the home AAA\n   (AAAH) MUST be able to coordinate the allocation of a home\
    \ address\n   with a home agent that might be designated by the mobile node.\n\
    \   Allocating a home address and a home agent for the mobile would\n   provide\
    \ a further simplification in the configuration needs for the\n   client's mobile\
    \ node.  Currently, in the Proposed Standard Mobile IP\n   specification [13]\
    \ a mobile node has to be configured with a home\n   address and the address of\
    \ a home agent, as well as with a security\n   association with that home agent.\
    \  In contrast, the proposed AAA\n   features would only require the mobile node\
    \ to be configured with its\n   NAI and a secure shared secret for use by the\
    \ AAAH.  The mobile\n   node's home address, the address of its home agent, the\
    \ security\n   association between the mobile node and the home agent, and even\
    \ the\n   identity (DNS name or IP address) of the AAAH can all be dynamically\n\
    \   determined as part of Mobile IP initial registration with the\n   mobility\
    \ agent in the foreign domain (i.e., a foreign agent with AAA\n   interface features).\
    \  Nevertheless, the mobile node may choose to\n   include the MN-HA security\
    \ extension as well as AAA credentials, and\n   the proposed Mobile IP and AAA\
    \ server model MUST work when both are\n   present.\n   The reason for all this\
    \ simplification is that the NAI encodes the\n   client's identity as well as\
    \ the name of the client's home domain;\n   this follows existing industry practice\
    \ for the way NAIs are used\n   today (see section 4).  The home domain name is\
    \ then available for\n   use by the local AAA (AAAL) to locate the home AAA serving\
    \ the\n   client's home domain.  In the general model, the AAAL would also have\n\
    \   to identify the appropriate security association for use with that\n   AAAH.\
    \ Section 6 discusses a way to reduce the number of security\n   associations\
    \ that have to be maintained between pairs of AAA servers\n   such as the AAAL\
    \ and AAAH just described.\n"

    \   that the AAA server SHOULD be able to issue control messages and keys\n  \

    \ which are\n   technically foreign subnets, but the services they need are local,\n\
    \   and hence communication with the home subnet as if they were residing\n  \
    \ on the home is not necessary.  As long as the mobile node can get an\n   address\
    \ routable from within the current domain (be it publicly, or\n   privately addressed)\
    \ it can use mobile IP to roam around that domain,\n   calling the subnet on which\
    \ it booted its temporary home.  This\n   address is likely to be dynamically\
    \ allocated upon request by the\n   mobile node.\n   In such situations, when\
    \ the client is willing to use a dynamically\n   allocated IP address and does\
    \ not have any preference for the\n   location of the home network (either geographical\
    \ or topological),\n   the local AAA server (AAAL) may be able to offer this additional\n\
    \   allocation service to the client.  Then, the home agent will be\n   located\
    \ in the local domain, which is likely to be offer smaller\n   delays for new\
    \ Mobile IP registrations.\n   In figure 4, AAAL has received a request from the\
    \ mobile node to\n   allocate a home agent in the local domain.  The new home\
    \ agent\n   receives keys from AAAL to enable future Mobile IP registrations.\n\
    \   From the picture, it is evident that such a configuration avoids\n   problems\
    \ with firewall protection at the domain boundaries, such as\n   were described\
    \ briefly in section 5.2.  On the other hand, this\n   configuration makes it\
    \ difficult for the mobile node to receive data\n   from any communications partners\
    \ in the mobile node's home\n   administrative domain.  Note that, in this model,\
    \ the mobile node's\n   home address is affiliated with the foreign domain for\
    \ routing\n   purposes.  Thus, any dynamic update to DNS, to associate the mobile\n\
    \   node's home FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name [10]) with its new IP\n   address,\
    \ will require insertion of a foreign IP address into the home\n   DNS server\

  - "5.4. Mobile IP with Local Payments\n   Since the AAAL is expected to be enabled\
    \ to allocate a local home\n   agent upon demand, we can make a further simplification.\
    \  In cases\n   where the AAAL can manage any necessary authorization function\n\
    \   locally (e.g., if the client pays with cash or a credit card), then\n   there\
    \ is no need for an AAA protocol or infrastructure to interact\n   with the AAAH.\
    \ The resulting simple configuration is illustrated in\n   figure 5.\n   In this\
    \ simplified model, we may consider that the role of the AAAH\n   is taken over\
    \ either by a national government (in the case of a cash\n   payment), or by a\
    \ card authorization service if payment is by credit\n   card, or some such authority\
    \ acceptable to all parties.  Then, the\n   AAAL expects those external authorities\
    \ to guarantee the value\n   represented by the client's payment credentials (cash\
    \ or credit).\n   There are likely to be other cases where clients are granted\
    \ access\n   to local resources, or access to the Internet, without any charges\
    \ at\n   all.  Such configurations may be found in airports and other common\n\

  - "5.5. Fast Handover\n   Since the movement from coverage area to coverage area\
    \ may be\n   frequent in Mobile IP networks, it is imperative that the latency\n\
    \   involved in the handoff process be minimized.  See, for instance, the\n  \
    \ Route Optimization document [15] for one way to do this using Binding\n   Updates.\
    \  When the mobile node enters a new visited subnet, it would\n   be desirable\
    \ for it to provide the previous foreign agent's NAI.  The\n   new FA can use\
    \ this information to either contact the previous FA to\n   retrieve the KDC session\
    \ key information, or it can attempt to\n   retrieve the keys from the AAAL. \
    \ If the AAAL cannot provide the\n   necessary keying information, the request\
    \ will have to be sent to the\n   mobile node's AAAH to retrieve new keying information.\
    \  After initial\n   authorization, further authorizations SHOULD be done locally\
    \ within\n   the Local Domain.\n   When a MN moves into a new foreign subnet as\
    \ a result of a handover\n   and is now served by a different FA, the AAAL in\
    \ this domain may\n   contact the AAAL in the domain that the MN has just been\
    \ handed off\n   from to verify the authenticity of the MN and/or to obtain the\n\
    \   session keys.  The new serving AAAL may determine the address of the\n   AAAL\
    \ in the previously visited domain from the previous FA NAI\n   information supplied\
    \ by the MN.\n"
- title: 6. Broker Model
  contents:
  - "6. Broker Model\n   The picture in Figure 1 shows a configuration in which the\
    \ local and\n   the home authority have to share trust.  Depending on the security\n\
    \   model used, this configuration can cause a quadratic growth in the\n   number\
    \ of trust relationships, as the number of AAA authorities (AAAL\n   and AAAH)\
    \ increases.  This has been identified as a problem by the\n   roamops working\
    \ group [3], and any AAA proposal MUST solve this\n   problem.  Using brokers\
    \ solves many of the scalability problems\n   associated with requiring direct\
    \ business/roaming relationships\n   between every two administrative domains.\
    \  In order to provide\n   scalable networks in highly diverse service provider\
    \ networks in\n   which there are many domains (e.g., many service providers and\
    \ large\n   numbers of private networks), multiple layers of brokers MUST be\n\
    \   supported for both of the broker models described.\n   Integrity or privacy\
    \ of information between the home and serving\n   domains may be achieved by either\
    \ hop-by-hop security associations or\n   end-to-end security associations established\
    \ with the help of the\n   broker infrastructure.  A broker may play the role\
    \ of a proxy between\n   two administrative domains which have security associations\
    \ with the\n   broker, and relay AAA messages back and forth securely.\n   Alternatively,\
    \ a broker may also enable the two domains with which it\n   has associations,\
    \ but the domains themselves do not have a direct\n   association, in establishing\
    \ a security association, thereby\n   bypassing the broker for carrying the messages\
    \ between the domains.\n   This may be established by virtue of having the broker\
    \ relay a shared\n   secret key to both the domains that are trying to establish\
    \ secure\n   communication and then have the domains use the keys supplied by\
    \ the\n   broker in setting up a security association.\n   Assuming that AAAB\
    \ accepts responsibility for payment to the serving\n   domain on behalf of the\
    \ home domain, the serving domain is assured of\n   receiving payments for services\
    \ offered.  However, the redirection\n   broker will usually require a copy of\
    \ authorization messages from the\n   home domain and accounting messages from\
    \ the serving domain, in order\n   for the broker to determine if it is willing\
    \ to accept responsibility\n   for the services being authorized and utilized.\
    \  If the broker does\n   not accept such responsibility for any reason, then\
    \ it must be able\n   to terminate service to a mobile node in the serving network.\
    \  In the\n   event that multiple brokers are involved, in most situations all\n\
    \   brokers must be so copied.  This may represent an additional burden\n   on\
    \ foreign agents and AAALs.\n   Though this mechanism may reduce latency in the\
    \ transit of messages\n   between the domains after the broker has completed its\
    \ involvement,\n   there may be many more messages involved as a result of additional\n\
    \   copies of authorization and accounting messages to the brokers\n   involved.\
    \  There may also be additional latency for initial access to\n   the network,\
    \ especially when a new security association needs to be\n   created between AAAL\
    \ and AAAH (for example, from the use of ISAKMP).\n   These delays may become\
    \ important factors for latency-critical\n   applications.\n                Local\

    \ Using a Broker\n   The AAAB in figure 6 is the broker's authority server.  The\
    \ broker\n   acts as a settlement agent, providing security and a central point\
    \ of\n   contact for many service providers and enterprises.\n   The AAAB enables\
    \ the local and home domains to cooperate without\n   requiring each of the networks\
    \ to have a direct business or security\n   relationship with all the other networks.\
    \  Thus, brokers offer the\n   needed scalability for managing trust relationships\
    \ between otherwise\n   independent network domains.  Use of the broker does not\
    \ preclude\n   managing separate trust relationships between domains, but it does\n\
    \   offer an alternative to doing so.  Just as with the AAAH and AAAL\n   (see\
    \ section 5), data specific to Mobile IP control messages MUST NOT\n   be processed\
    \ by the AAAB.  Any credentials or accounting data to be\n   processed by the\
    \ AAAB must be present in AAA message units, not\n   extracted from Mobile IP\
    \ protocol extensions.\n   The following requirements come mostly from [2], which\
    \ discusses use\n   of brokers in the particular case of authorization for roaming\
    \ dial-\n   up users.\n   -  allowing management of trust with external domains\
    \ by way of\n      brokered AAA.\n   -  accounting reliability.  Accounting data\
    \ that traverses the\n      Internet may suffer substantial packet loss.  Since\
    \ accounting\n      packets may traverse one or more intermediate authorization\
    \ points\n      (e.g., brokers), retransmission is needed from intermediate points\n\
    \      to avoid long end-to-end delays.\n   -  End to End security.  The Local\
    \ Domain and Home Domain must be\n      able to verify signatures within the message,\
    \ even though the\n      message is passed through an intermediate authority server.\n\
    \   -  Since the AAAH in the home domain MAY be sending sensitive\n      information,\
    \ such as registration keys, the broker MUST be able to\n      pass encrypted\
    \ data between the AAA servers.\n   The need for End-to-End security results from\
    \ the following attacks\n   which were identified when brokered operation uses\
    \ RADIUS [16] (see\n   [2] for more information on the individual attacks):\n\
    \      + Message editing\n      + Attribute editing\n      + Theft of shared secrets\n\
    \      + Theft and modification of accounting data\n      + Replay attacks\n \
    \     + Connection hijacking\n      + Fraudulent accounting\n   These are serious\
    \ problems which cannot be allowed to persist in any\n   acceptable AAA protocol\
    \ and infrastructure.\n"

  - "7. Security Considerations\n   This is a requirements document for AAA based\
    \ on Mobile IP.  Because\n   AAA is security driven, most of this document addresses\
    \ the security\n   considerations AAA MUST make on behalf of Mobile IP.  As with\
    \ any\n   security proposal, adding more entities that interact using security\n\
    \   protocols creates new administrative requirements for maintaining the\n  \
    \ appropriate security associations between the entities.  In the case\n   of\
    \ the AAA services proposed however, these administrative\n   requirements are\
    \ natural, and already well understood in today's\n   Internet because of experience\
    \ with dial up network access.\n"
- title: 8. IPv6 Considerations
  contents:
  - "8. IPv6 Considerations\n   The main difference between Mobile IP for IPv4 and\
    \ Mobile IPv6 is\n   that in IPv6 there is no foreign agent.  The attendant function,\n\
    \   therefore, has to be located elsewhere.  Logical repositories for\n   that\
    \ function are either at the local router, for stateless address\n   autoconfiguration,\
    \ or else at the nearest DHCPv6 server, for stateful\n   address autoconfiguration.\
    \  In the latter case, it is possible that\n   there would be a close relationship\
    \ between the DHCPv6 server and the\n   AAALv6, but we believe that the protocol\
    \ functions should still be\n   maintained separately.\n   The MN-NAI would be\
    \ equally useful for identifying the mobile node to\n   the AAALv6 as is described\
    \ in earlier sections of this document.\n"
