- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   IP anycasting [RFC4786] has been deployed for an array of\
    \ network\n   services since the early 1990s.  It provides a mechanism for a given\n\
    \   network resource to be available in a more distributed manner,\n   locally\
    \ and/or globally, with a more robust and resilient footprint,\n   commonly yielding\
    \ better localization and absorption of systemic\n   query loads, as well as better\
    \ protections in the face of distributed\n   denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks,\
    \ network partitions, and other\n   similar incidents.  A large part of the Internet\
    \ root DNS\n   infrastructure, as well as many other resources, has been anycasted\n\
    \   for nearly a decade.\n   While the benefits realized by anycasting network\
    \ services is proven,\n   some issues do emerge with asserting routing system\
    \ reachability for\n   a common network identifier from multiple locations.  Specifically,\n\
    \   anycasting in BGP requires injection of reachability information in\n   the\
    \ routing system for a common IP address prefix from multiple\n   locations. \
    \ These anycasted prefixes and network services have\n   traditionally employed\
    \ a common origin autonomous system number (ASN)\n   in order to preserve historically\
    \ scarce 16-bit AS number space\n   utilized by BGP for routing domain identifiers\
    \ in the global routing\n   system.  Additionally, a common origin AS number was\
    \ used in order to\n   ease management overhead of resource operations associated\
    \ with\n   acquiring and maintaining multiple discrete AS numbers as well as to\n\
    \   avoid triggering various operations-oriented reporting functions\n   aimed\
    \ at identifying \"inconsistent origin AS announcements\" observed\n   in the\
    \ routing system.  As a result, the representation of routing\n   system path\
    \ attributes associated with those service instances, and\n   that anycasted prefix\
    \ itself, typically bear no per-instance\n   discriminators in the routing system\
    \ (i.e., within the network\n   control plane itself).\n   Service-level query\
    \ capabilities may or may not provide a mechanism\n   to identify which anycast\
    \ node responded to a particular query,\n   although this is likely both service\
    \ (e.g., DNS or NTP) and\n   implementation dependent.  For example, Name Server\
    \ Daemon (NSD),\n   Unbound, and BIND all provide 'hostname.bind or hostname.id'\n\
    \   [RFC4892] [RFC5001] query support that enables service-level\n   identification\
    \ of a given server.  Tools such as traceroute are also\n   used to determine\
    \ to which location a given query is being routed,\n   although it may not reveal\
    \ local-scope anycast instances, or if there\n   are multiple servers within a\
    \ given anycast node, which of the\n   servers responded to a given query, in\
    \ particular, when multiple\n   servers within an anycast node are connected to\
    \ a single IP router.\n   When utilizing these service-level capabilities, query\
    \ responses are\n   typically both deterministic and inherently topology dependent;\n\
    \   however, these service-level identifiers at the data plane provide no\n  \
    \ control plane (routing system) uniqueness.\n   As more services are globally\
    \ anycasted, and existing anycasted\n   services realize wider deployment of anycast\
    \ nodes for a given\n   service address in order to accommodate growing system\
    \ loads, the\n   difficulty of providing safeguards and controls to better protect\n\
    \   those resources expands.  Intuitively, the more widely distributed a\n   given\
    \ anycasted service address is, the more difficult it becomes for\n   network\
    \ operators to detect operational and security issues that\n   affect that service.\
    \  Some examples of such security and operational\n   issues include BGP route\
    \ leaks affecting the anycasted service, rogue\n   anycast nodes appearing for\
    \ the service, or the emergence of other\n   aberrant behavior in either the routing\
    \ system, the forward query\n   datapath, or query response datapath.  Diagnosis\
    \ of the routing\n   system issues is complicated by the fact that no unique\n\
    \   discriminators exist in the routing system to identify a given local\n   or\
    \ global anycast node.  Furthermore, both datapath and routing\n   system problem\
    \ identification is compounded by the fact that these\n   incident types can be\
    \ topologically dependent, and only observable\n   between a given client-server\
    \ set.\n   Additionally, while it goes without saying that many anycasted\n  \
    \ services strive for exact synchronization across all instances of an\n   anycasted\
    \ service address, if local policies or data plane response\n   manipulation techniques\
    \ were to \"influence\" responses within a given\n   region in such a way that\
    \ those responses are no longer authentic or\n   that they diverge from what other\
    \ nodes within an anycasted service\n   were providing, then it should be an absolute\
    \ necessity that those\n   modified resources only be utilized by service consumers\
    \ within that\n   region or influencer's jurisdiction.\n   Mechanisms should exist\
    \ at both the network- and service-layer to\n   make it abundantly apparent to\
    \ operators and users alike whether any\n   of the query responses are not authentic.\
    \  For DNS, DNSSEC [RFC4033]\n   provides this capability at the service layer\
    \ with object-level\n   integrity, assuming validation is being performed by recursive\
    \ name\n   servers, and DNSSEC deployment at the root and top-level domain (TLD)\n\
    \   levels is well underway [DNSSEC-DEPLOY].  Furthermore, control plane\n   discriminators\
    \ should exist to enable operators to know toward which\n   of a given set of\
    \ instances a query is being directed, and to enable\n   detection and alerting\
    \ capabilities when this changes.  Such\n   discriminators may also be employed\
    \ to enable anycast node preference\n   or filtering keys, should local operational\
    \ policy require it.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This document employs much of the following terminology,\
    \ which was\n   taken in full from Section 2 of [RFC4786].\n      Service Address:\
    \  an IP address associated with a particular\n         service (e.g., the destination\
    \ address used by DNS resolvers to\n         reach a particular authority server).\n\
    \      Anycast:  the practice of making a particular Service Address\n       \
    \  available in multiple, discrete, autonomous locations, such\n         that\
    \ datagrams sent are routed to one of several available\n         locations.\n\
    \      Anycast Node:  an internally-connected collection of hosts and\n      \
    \   routers that together provide service for an anycast Service\n         Address.\
    \  An Anycast Node might be as simple as a single host\n         participating\
    \ in a routing system with adjacent routers, or it\n         might include a number\
    \ of hosts connected in some more\n         elaborate fashion; in either case,\
    \ to the routing system across\n         which the service is being anycast, each\
    \ Anycast Node presents\n         a unique path to the Service Address.  The entire\
    \ anycast\n         system for the service consists of two or more separate Anycast\n\
    \         Nodes.\n      Catchment:  in physical geography, an area drained by\
    \ a river,\n         also known as a drainage basin.  By analogy, as used in this\n\
    \         document, the topological region of a network within which\n       \
    \  packets directed at an Anycast Address are routed to one\n         particular\
    \ node.\n      Local-Scope Anycast:  reachability information for the anycast\n\
    \         Service Address is propagated through a routing system in such\n   \
    \      a way that a particular anycast node is only visible to a\n         subset\
    \ of the whole routing system.\n      Local Node:  an Anycast Node providing service\
    \ using a Local-Scope\n         Anycast Address.\n      Global Node:  an Anycast\
    \ Node providing service using a Global-\n         Scope Anycast Address.\n  \
    \    Global-Scope Anycast:  reachability information for the anycast\n       \
    \  Service Address is propagated through a routing system in such\n         a\
    \ way that a particular anycast node is potentially visible to\n         the whole\
    \ routing system.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Recommendation for Unique Origin ASNs
  contents:
  - "3.  Recommendation for Unique Origin ASNs\n   In order to be able to better detect\
    \ changes to routing information\n   associated with critical anycasted resources,\
    \ globally anycasted\n   services with partitioned origin ASNs SHOULD utilize\
    \ a unique origin\n   ASN per node where possible, if appropriate in their operating\n\
    \   environment and service model.\n   Discrete origin ASNs per node provide a\
    \ discriminator in the routing\n   system that would enable detection of leaked\
    \ or hijacked instances\n   more quickly and would enable operators that so choose\
    \ to proactively\n   develop routing policies that express preferences or avoidance\
    \ for a\n   given node or set of nodes associated with an anycasted service.\n\
    \   This is particularly useful when it is observed that local policy or\n   known\
    \ issues exist with the performance or authenticity of responses\n   returned\
    \ from a specific anycast node, or that enacted policies meant\n   to affect service\
    \ within a particular region are affecting users\n   outside of that region as\
    \ a result of a given anycast catchment\n   expanding beyond its intended scope.\n\
    \   Furthermore, inconsistent origin AS announcements associated with\n   anycasted\
    \ services for critical infrastructure SHOULD NOT be deemed\n   undesirable by\
    \ routing system reporting functions, but should instead\n   be embraced in order\
    \ to better identify the connectedness and\n   footprint of a given anycasted\
    \ service.\n   While namespace conservation and reasonable use of AS number\n\
    \   resources should always be a goal, the introduction of 32-bit ASNs\n   significantly\
    \ lessens concerns in this space.  Globally anycasted\n   resources, in particular,\
    \ those associated with critical\n   infrastructure-enabling services such as\
    \ root and TLD name servers,\n   SHOULD warrant special consideration with regard\
    \ to AS number\n   allocation practices during policy development by the constituents\
    \ of\n   those responsible organizations (e.g., the Regional Internet\n   Registries).\
    \  Additionally, defining precisely what constitutes\n   \"critical infrastructure\
    \ services\" or \"special consideration\" (e.g.,\n   some small range of 32-bit\
    \ AS numbers might be provided) is left to\n   the constituents of those organizations.\
    \  Additionally, critical\n   infrastructure employment of 32-bit ASNs for new\
    \ nodes might well\n   help to foster more rapid adoption of native 32-bit ASN\
    \ support by\n   network operators.\n   One additional benefit of unique origin\
    \ AS numbers per anycast node\n   is that Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)\
    \ Secure Inter-domain\n   Routing [SIDR] machinery, and, in particular, that of\
    \ Route Origin\n   Authorizations (ROAs), and routing policies that may be derived\
    \ based\n   on those ROAs, can be employed with per-anycast-node resolution,\n\
    \   rather than relying on a single ROA and common origin AS to cover all\n  \
    \ instantiations of an anycasted prefix (possibly hundreds) within the\n   global\
    \ routing system.  For example, in the case of deployments that\n   incorporate\
    \ partitioned ASN anycast models that have a single ASN\n   bound to all nodes\
    \ but crossing organizational or political\n   boundaries, a situation may arise\
    \ where nobody would be deemed\n   appropriate to hold the key for the ROA.  Additionally,\
    \ a globally\n   anycasted service within a given IP prefix that shares a common\
    \ ASN\n   might be taken totally offline because of the revocation of an ROA\n\
    \   for that origin ASN.  Today's RPKI model already inherently\n   accommodates\
    \ issuance of multiple ROAs with unique origins for a\n   given prefix.\n"
- title: 4.  Additional Recommendations for Globally Anycasted Services
  contents:
  - "4.  Additional Recommendations for Globally Anycasted Services\n   Two additional\
    \ recommendations for globally anycasted critical\n   infrastructure services\
    \ are related to publication of information\n   associated with a given node's\
    \ physical location, and with which\n   adjacent upstream ASNs an origin AS interconnects.\
    \  The former would\n   allow operators to better define and optimize preferences\
    \ associated\n   with a given node to align with local policy and service\n  \
    \ optimizations.  The latter would allow expression through policy such\n   as\
    \ Routing Policy Specification Language [RFC4012] specified in\n   Internet Routing\
    \ Registries (IRRs) in a manner that illustrates a\n   discrete set of upstream\
    \ ASNs for each anycast node, rather than the\n   current model where all upstream\
    \ ASNs associated with a common origin\n   AS may or may not be expressed.  This\
    \ information would provide an\n   additional level of static routing policy or\
    \ monitoring and detection\n   models by network operators and perhaps explicit\
    \ network-layer source\n   address validation in the datapath.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The recommendations made in this memo aim to\
    \ provide more flexibility\n   for network operators hoping to better monitor\
    \ and prevent issues\n   related to globally anycasted critical infrastructure\
    \ resources.\n   Anycast itself provides considerable benefit in the face of certain\n\
    \   attacks; yet, if a given instance of a service can appear at many\n   points\
    \ in the routing system and legitimate instances are difficult\n   to distinguish\
    \ from malicious ones, then anycast expands the\n   service's attack surface rather\
    \ than reducing it.\n   The recommendations made in this document are expressed\
    \ to assist\n   with visibility and policy specification capabilities in order\
    \ to\n   improve the availability of critical Internet resources.  Use cases,\n\
    \   where the recommendations outlined in this memo may have helped to\n   more\
    \ easily detect or scope the impact of a particular incident, are\n   illustrated\
    \ in [RENESYS-BLOG].\n   Furthermore, while application-layer protection mechanisms\
    \ such as\n   DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) provide object-level integrity\
    \ and\n   authentication, they often do so at the cost of introducing more\n \
    \  failure conditions.  For example, if a recursive name server is\n   performing\
    \ DNSSEC validator functions and receives a bogus response\n   to a given query\
    \ as a result of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) or\n   injected spoofed response packet\
    \ such as a cache-poisoning attempt,\n   the possibility might exist that the\
    \ response packet is processed by\n   the server and results in some temporal\
    \ or persistent DoS condition\n   on the recursive name server and for its client\
    \ set.  The unique\n   origin AS mechanism outlined in this document provides\
    \ the capability\n   for network operators to expressly avoid anycast node catchments\n\
    \   known to regularly elicit bogus responses, while allowing the\n   anycasted\
    \ service address to remain available otherwise.\n"
- title: 6.  Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Deployment Considerations\n   Maintenance of unique ASNs for each node within\
    \ an anycasted service\n   may be challenging for some critical infrastructure\
    \ service operators\n   initially, but for globally anycasted resources, there\
    \ needs to be\n   some type of per-node discriminator in the control plane to\
    \ enable\n   detection, remediation, and optimally, preventative controls for\n\
    \   dealing with routing system anomalies that are intensified by the\n   application\
    \ of IP anycasting.  Additionally, this technique sets the\n   stage to employ\
    \ RPKI-enabled machinery and more secure and explicit\n   routing policies, which\
    \ all network operators should be considering.\n   The granularity of data publication\
    \ related to anycast node location\n   should be left to the devises of each services\
    \ operator, and the\n   value of this mechanism in each operator's unique environment,\
    \ but\n   some reasonable level of detail to enable operators and service\n  \
    \ consumers to make informed decisions that align with their security\n   and\
    \ operational objectives as outlined herein should be provided by\n   each critical\
    \ services operator.\n   Adjacent AS information for a given origin AS can already\
    \ be obtained\n   through careful routing system analysis when prefixes are advertised\n\
    \   via a given set of AS adjacencies, and therefore, should present no\n   new\
    \ threat.  However, network interconnection and peering policies\n   may well\
    \ present some challenges in this area.  For example, if a\n   technique such\
    \ as unique origin AS per node is employed, then a\n   single organization may\
    \ no longer have a single AS for\n   interconnection at each location, and interconnection\
    \ policies should\n   expressly consider this.  That said, interconnection with\
    \ networks\n   that provide critical infrastructure services should certainly\
    \ be\n   given due consideration as such by network operators when evaluating\n\
    \   interconnection strategies.\n   Today, some root and TLD operators identify\
    \ erroneous anycast prefix\n   announcements by detecting prefix announcements\
    \ with an origin AS\n   other than the common origin AS shared via all nodes.\
    \  This detection\n   model would need to be expanded to account for unique origin\
    \ ASNs per\n   node if a given service operator chooses to employ such a model.\n\
    \   Given that AS paths are trivial to manipulate in the current system,\n   the\
    \ above technique would only assist in the event of unintentional\n   configuration\
    \ errors that reoriginate the route (e.g., it does not\n   detect leaks that preserve\
    \ the initial path elements).  In that case,\n   work underway on routing security\
    \ origin and path validation in the\n   SIDR working group and beyond should be\
    \ consulted.\n   While local policy based on any BGP attributes, to include AS\
    \ path\n   information, can influence policy within a local administrative\n \
    \  domain and possibly downstream, there exists a possibility that\n   upstream\
    \ nodes continue to use a route deemed undesirable by the\n   local administrator\
    \ once data packets reach that network.  Network\n   operators must understand\
    \ the implications of this property in their\n   operating environment, as it\
    \ is inherent in all Internet routing.\n   Finally, anycast node presence at exchange\
    \ points that employ route\n   servers may make enumeration of adjacent ASNs for\
    \ a given node\n   challenging.  While this is understood, service operators should\
    \ make\n   every effort to enumerate the set of adjacent ASNs associated with\
    \ a\n   given anycast node's origin AS.  Without express understanding of\n  \
    \ legitimate AS interconnection and authorized origin AS information,\n   more\
    \ secure routing is difficult to achieve.\n"
