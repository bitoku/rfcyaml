- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Kerberos 5 network authentication protocol, originally specified\n\
    \   in RFC 1510, can use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for\n   encryption.\
    \  Almost 30 years after first publishing DES, the National\n   Institute of Standards\
    \ and Technology (NIST) finally withdrew the\n   standard in 2005, reflecting\
    \ a long-established consensus that DES is\n   insufficiently secure.  By 2008,\
    \ commercial hardware costing less\n   than USD 15,000 could break DES keys in\
    \ less than a day on average.\n   DES is long past its sell-by date.  Accordingly,\
    \ this document\n   updates RFC 1964, RFC 4120, RFC 4121, and RFC 4757 to deprecate\
    \ the\n   use of DES, RC4-HMAC-EXP, and other weak cryptographic algorithms in\n\
    \   Kerberos.  Because RFC 1510 (obsoleted by RFC 4120) supports only\n   DES,\
    \ this document recommends the reclassification of RFC 1510 as\n   Historic.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The original specification of the Kerberos 5 network authentication\n\
    \   protocol [RFC1510] supports only the Data Encryption Standard (DES)\n   for\
    \ encryption.  For many years, the cryptographic community has\n   regarded DES\
    \ as providing inadequate security, mostly because of its\n   small key size.\
    \  Accordingly, this document recommends the\n   reclassification of [RFC1510]\
    \ (obsoleted by [RFC4120]) as Historic\n   and updates current Kerberos-related\
    \ specifications [RFC1964],\n   [RFC4120], and [RFC4121] to deprecate the use\
    \ of DES and other weak\n   cryptographic algorithms in Kerberos, including some\
    \ unkeyed\n   checksums and hashes, along with the weak 56-bit \"export strength\"\
    \n   RC4 variant encryption type of [RFC4757].\n"

- title: 3.  Affected Specifications
  contents:
  - "3.  Affected Specifications\n   The original IETF specification of Kerberos 5\
    \ [RFC1510] only supports\n   DES for encryption.  [RFC4120] obsoletes [RFC1510]\
    \ and updates the\n   Kerberos specification to include additional cryptographic\n\
    \   algorithms, but still permits the use of DES.  [RFC3961] describes\n   the\
    \ Kerberos cryptographic system and includes support for DES\n   encryption types,\
    \ but it does not specify requirement levels for\n   them.\n   The specification\
    \ of the Kerberos Generic Security Services\n   Application Programming Interface\
    \ (GSS-API) mechanism [RFC1964] and\n   its updated version [RFC4121] define checksum\
    \ and encryption\n   mechanisms based on DES.  With the existence of newer encryption\n\
    \   types for Kerberos GSS-API defined in [RFC4121], Microsoft's\n   RC4-HMAC-based\
    \ GSS-API mechanism, and MIT's DES3 (which is not\n   published as an RFC), there\
    \ is no need to support the old DES-based\n   integrity (SGN) and confidentiality\
    \ (SEAL) types.\n   [RFC4757] describes the RC4-HMAC encryption types used by\
    \ Microsoft\n   Windows and allows for a 56-bit \"export strength\" variant. \
    \ (The\n   character constant \"fortybits\" used in the definition is a historical\n\
    \   reference and does not refer to the actual key size of the encryption\n  \
    \ type.)\n"
- title: 4.  DES Insecurity
  contents:
  - "4.  DES Insecurity\n   The insecurity of DES has been evident for many years.\
    \  Even around\n   the time of its first publication, cryptographers raised the\n\
    \   possibility that 56 bits was too small a key size for DES.  The\n   National\
    \ Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) officially\n   withdrew DES in\
    \ 2005 [DES-Withdrawal], and also announced a\n   transition period that ended\
    \ on May 19, 2007 [DES-Transition-Plan].\n   The IETF has also published its position\
    \ in [RFC4772], in which the\n   recommendation summary is very clear: \"don't\
    \ use DES\".\n   In 2006, researchers demonstrated the ability to find a DES key\
    \ via\n   brute-force search in an average of less than 9 days using less than\n\
    \   EUR 10,000 worth of hardware [Break-DES].  By 2008, a company was\n   offering\
    \ hardware capable of breaking a DES key in less than a day on\n   average [DES-1day]\
    \ that cost less than USD 15,000 [DES-Crack].\n   Brute-force key searches of\
    \ DES will only get faster and cheaper.\n   (The aforementioned company markets\
    \ its device for one-click recovery\n   of lost DES keys.)  It is clear that it\
    \ is well past time to retire\n   the use of DES in Kerberos.\n"
- title: 5.  Recommendations
  contents:
  - "5.  Recommendations\n   This document hereby removes the following RECOMMENDED\
    \ types from\n   [RFC4120]:\n      Encryption: DES-CBC-MD5(3)\n      Checksums:\
    \ DES-MD5 (8, named RSA-MD5-DES in [RFC3961]).\n   Kerberos implementations and\
    \ deployments SHOULD NOT implement or\n   deploy the following single DES encryption\
    \ types: DES-CBC-CRC(1),\n   DES-CBC-MD4(2), DES-CBC-MD5(3) (updates [RFC4120]).\n\
    \   Kerberos implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT implement or\n   deploy\
    \ the following \"export strength\" RC4 variant encryption type:\n   RC4-HMAC-EXP(24)\
    \ (updates [RFC4757]).  This document does not add any\n   sort of requirement\
    \ for conforming implementations to implement\n   RC4-HMAC(23).\n   Kerberos implementations\
    \ and deployments SHOULD NOT implement or\n   deploy the following checksum types:\
    \ CRC32(1), RSA-MD4(2),\n   RSA-MD4-DES(3), DES-MAC(4), DES-MAC-K(5), RSA-MD4-DES-K(6),\n\
    \   RSA-MD5-DES(8) (updates [RFC4120]).\n   It is possible to safely use the RSA-MD5(7)\
    \ checksum type, but only\n   with additional protection, such as the protection\
    \ that an encrypted\n   Authenticator provides.  Implementations MAY use RSA-MD5\
    \ inside an\n   encrypted Authenticator for backward compatibility with systems\
    \ that\n   do not support newer checksum types (updates [RFC4120]).  One example\n\
    \   is that some legacy systems only support RC4-HMAC(23) [RFC4757] for\n   encryption\
    \ when DES is not available; these systems use RSA-MD5\n   checksums inside Authenticators\
    \ encrypted with RC4-HMAC.\n   Kerberos GSS mechanism implementations and deployments\
    \ SHOULD NOT\n   implement or deploy the following SGN ALG: DES MAC MD5(0000),\n\
    \   MD2.5(0100), DES MAC(0200) (updates [RFC1964]).\n   Kerberos GSS mechanism\
    \ implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT\n   implement or deploy the following\
    \ SEAL ALG: DES(0000) (updates\n   [RFC1964]).\n   The effect of the two last\
    \ sentences is that this document deprecates\n   Section 1.2 of [RFC1964].\n \
    \  This document hereby recommends the reclassification of [RFC1510] as\n   Historic.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Removing support for single DES improves security\
    \ because DES is\n   considered to be insecure.  RC4-HMAC-EXP has a similarly\
    \ inadequate\n   key size, so removing support for it also improves security.\n\
    \   Kerberos defines some encryption types that are either underspecified\n  \
    \ or that only have number assignments but no specifications.\n   Implementations\
    \ should make sure that they only implement and enable\n   secure encryption types.\n\
    \   The security considerations of [RFC4757] continue to apply to\n   RC4-HMAC,\
    \ including the known weaknesses of RC4 and MD4, and this\n   document does not\
    \ change the Informational status of [RFC4757] for\n   now.  The main reason to\
    \ not actively discourage the use of RC4-HMAC\n   is that it is the only encryption\
    \ type that interoperates with older\n   versions of Microsoft Windows once DES\
    \ and RC4-HMAC-EXP are removed.\n   These older versions of Microsoft Windows\
    \ will likely be in use until\n   at least 2015.\n"
