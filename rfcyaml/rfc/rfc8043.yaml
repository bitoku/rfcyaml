  - "1.1.  Overall Context\n   BCP 38 recommends ingress traffic filtering to prohibit\
    \ Denial-of-\n   Service (DoS) attacks.  As such, datagrams with source addresses\
    \ that\n   do not match with the network where the host is attached are\n   discarded\
    \ [RFC2827].  Preventing packets from being dropped due to\n   ingress filtering\
    \ is difficult, especially in multihomed networks\n   where the host receives\
    \ more than one prefix from the networks it is\n   connected to, and consequently\
    \ may have more than one source address.\n   Based on BCP 38, BCP 84 introduced\
    \ recommendations on the routing\n   system for multihomed networks [RFC3704].\n\
    \   Recommendations on the routing system for ingress filtering such as\n   in\
    \ BCP 84 inevitably involve source address checks.  This leads to\n   source-address-dependent-routing\
    \ (SADR).  Source-address-dependent\n   routing can be problematic, especially\
    \ when the host is connected to\n   a multihomed network and is communicating\
    \ with another host in\n   another multihomed network.  In such a case, the communication\
    \ can be\n   broken in both directions if Network Providers apply ingress\n  \
    \ filtering and the datagrams contain the wrong source addresses (see\n   [INGRESS_FIL]\
    \ for more details).\n   Hosts with simultaneously active interfaces receive multiple\
    \ prefixes\n   and have multiple source addresses.  Datagrams originating from\
    \ such\n   hosts are likely to be filtered due to ingress filtering policies.\n\
    \   The source address selection algorithm needs to carefully avoid\n   ingress\
    \ filtering on the next-hop router [RFC6724].\n   Many use cases have been reported\
    \ for source/destination routing --\n   see [SD_RTG].  These use cases clearly\
    \ indicate that the multihomed\n   host or Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) router\
    \ needs to be\n   configured with the correct source prefixes/addresses so that\
    \ it can\n   forward packets upstream correctly to prevent the ingress filtering\n\
    \   applied by an upstream Network Provider from dropping the packets.\n   In\
    \ multihomed networks, there is a need to enforce source-address-\n   based routing\
    \ if some providers are performing ingress filtering.\n   This requires that the\
    \ routers consider the source addresses as well\n   as the destination addresses\
    \ in determining the packet's next hop.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Scope\n   Based on the use cases defined in [SD_RTG], the routers may be\n\
    \   informed about the source addresses to use for forwarding using\n   extensions\
    \ to the routing protocols like IS-IS [ISO.10589.1992]\n   [SD_RTG_ISIS], OSPF\
    \ [RFC5340] [SD_RTG_OSPF].\n   In this document, we describe the scenarios for\
    \ source-address-\n   dependent routing from the host's perspective.  Two flavors\
    \ can be\n   considered:\n   1.  A host may have a single interface with multiple\
    \ addresses (from\n       different prefixes or /64s).  Each prefix is delegated\
    \ from\n       different exit routers, and this case can be called \"multihomed\n\
    \       with multi-prefix\" (MHMP).  In such case, source address\n       selection\
    \ is performed by the host while source-dependent routing\n       is enforced\
    \ by an upstream router.\n   2.  A host may have simultaneously connected multiple\
    \ interfaces\n       where each interface is connected to a different exit router,\
    \ and\n       this case can be called \"multi-prefix multiple interface\" (MPMI).\n\
    \       For this case, the host is required to support both source\n       address\
    \ selection and source-dependent routing to avoid the need\n       for an upstream\
    \ router to rewrite the IPv6 prefix.\n   Several limitations arise in multihoming\
    \ contexts based on NAT and\n   IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6)\
    \ [RFC6296]; see, for\n   example, [RFC4116].  NPTv6 is out of scope for this\
    \ document.\n   This document was initially written to inform the community about\
    \ the\n   SADR problem space.  It was updated to record the various sets of\n\
    \   alternate solutions to address that problem space.  The 6man WG\n   consensus\
    \ is documented in [RFC8028].\n"

    \ Network\n   Providers, each advertising its own prefixes.  In this case, the\
    \ host\n   may have a single interface, but it receives multiple prefixes from\n\
    \   the upstream Network Providers.  Assuming that providers apply the\n   ingress\
    \ filtering policy, the packets for any external communication\n   from the host\
    \ should follow source-address-dependent routing in order\n   to avoid getting\

    \ at the host with proper source address and\n   next-hop selection.  For this,\
    \ each router connected to different\n   interfaces of the host uses Router Advertisements\
    \ (RAs) [RFC4861] to\n   distribute a default route, the next hop, and the source\
    \ address/\n   prefix information to the host.  As a reminder, while the Prefix\n\
    \   Information Option (PIO) is defined in [RFC4861], the Route\n   Information\
    \ Option (RIO) is defined in [RFC4191].\n   Section 3.1 presents an analysis of\
    \ the scenarios in Section 2, and\n   Section 3.2 discusses the relevance of SADR\
    \ to the provisioning\n   domains.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Scenarios Analysis
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Scenarios Analysis\n   As in [RFC7157], we assume that the routers in Section\
    \ 2 use RAs to\n   distribute default route and source address prefixes supported\
    \ in\n   each next hop to the hosts or that the gateway/CPE router relays this\n\
    \   information to the hosts.\n   Referring to Section 2.1, source address selection\
    \ is undertaken by\n   the host while source-dependent routing must be followed\
    \ by \"rtr\" to\n   avoid packets being dropped.  No particular modification is\
    \ required\n   for next-hop selection at the host.\n   Referring to the scenario\
    \ in Figure 2, source-address-dependent\n   routing can present a solution to\
    \ the problem of when the host wishes\n   to reach a destination in network 2\
    \ and the host chooses \"rtr1\" as\n   the default router.  The solution assumes\
    \ that the host is correctly\n   configured.  The host should be configured with\
    \ the prefixes\n   supported in these next hops.  This way the host, having received\n\
    \   many prefixes, will have the correct information for selecting the\n   right\
    \ source address and next hop when sending packets to remote\n   destinations.\n\
    \   Note that similar considerations apply to the scenario in Figure 5.\n   In\
    \ the configuration of the scenario (Figure 1), it is also useful to\n   configure\
    \ the host with the prefixes and source address prefixes they\n   support.  This\
    \ will enable the host to select the right prefix when\n   sending packets to\
    \ the right next hop and avoid any issues with\n   ingress filtering.\n   Let\
    \ us analyze the scenario in Section 2.3.  If a source-address-\n   dependent\
    \ routing protocol is used, the two routers (\"rtr1\" and\n   \"rtr2\") are both\
    \ able to route traffic correctly, no matter which\n   next-hop router and source\
    \ address the host selects.  In case the\n   host chooses the wrong next-hop router,\
    \ e.g., \"rtr1\" is selected for\n   Provider 2, \"rtr1\" will forward the traffic\
    \ to \"rtr2\" to be sent to\n   Network Provider 2 and no ingress filtering will\
    \ happen.\n   Note that home networks are expected to comply with requirements\
    \ for\n   source-address-dependent routing and that the routers will be\n   configured\
    \ accordingly no matter which routing protocol is used\n   [RFC7788].\n   This\
    \ would work, but with some issues.  The host traffic to Provider\n   2 will have\
    \ to go over two links instead of one, i.e., the link\n   bandwidth will be halved.\
    \  Another possibility is that \"rtr1\" can\n   send an ICMPv6 Redirect message\
    \ to the host to direct the traffic to\n   \"rtr2\".  The host would then redirect\
    \ Provider 2 traffic to \"rtr2\".\n   The problem with redirects is that the ICMPv6\
    \ Redirect message can\n   only convey two addresses, i.e., in this case the router\
    \ address, or\n   \"rtr2\" address and the destination address, or the destination\
    \ host\n   in Provider 2.  That means that the source address will not be\n  \
    \ communicated.  As a result, the host would send packets to the same\n   destination\
    \ using both source addresses, which causes \"rtr2\" to send\n   a redirect message\
    \ to \"rtr1\", resulting in ping-pong redirects sent\n   by \"rtr1\" and \"rtr2\"\
    .\n   A solution to these issues is to configure the host with the source\n  \
    \ address prefixes that the next hop supports.  In a homenet context,\n   each\
    \ interface of the host can be configured by its next-hop router,\n   so that\
    \ all that is needed is to add the information about source\n   address prefixes.\
    \  This results in the hosts selecting the right\n   router, no matter what.\n\
    \   Source-address-dependent routing in the use case of specialized\n   egress\
    \ routing (Section 2.4) may work as follows.  The specialized\n   service router\
    \ advertises one or more specific prefixes with\n   appropriate source prefixes,\
    \ e.g., to the CPE router, \"rtr\" in\n   Figure 1.  The CPE router in turn advertises\
    \ the specific service's\n   prefixes and source prefixes to the host.  This will\
    \ allow proper\n   configuration at the host so that the host can use the service\
    \ by\n   sending the packets with the correct source and destination\n   addresses.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Provisioning Domains and SADR\n   A consistent set of network configuration\
    \ information is called a\n   provisioning domain (PvD).  In the case of multihomed\
    \ with multi-\n   prefix (MHMP), more than one provisioning domain is present\
    \ on a\n   single link.  In the case of multi-prefix multiple interface (MPMI)\n\
    \   environments, elements of the same domain may be present on multiple\n   links.\
    \  PvD-aware nodes support association of configuration\n   information into PvDs\
    \ and use these PvDs to serve requests for\n   network connections, e.g., choosing\
    \ the right source address for the\n   packets.  PvDs can be constructed from\
    \ one of more DHCP or Router\n   Advertisement (RA) options carrying such information\
    \ as PvD identity\n   and PvD container [MPvD_NDP] [MPvD_DHCP].  PvDs constructed\
    \ based on\n   such information are called explicit PvDs [RFC7556].\n   Apart\
    \ from PvD identity, PvD content may be encapsulated in separate\n   RA or DHCP\
    \ options called the PvD Container Option.  These options\n   are placed in the\
    \ container options of an explicit PvD.\n   Explicit PvDs may be received from\
    \ different interfaces.  A single\n   PvD may be accessible over one interface\
    \ or simultaneously accessible\n   over multiple interfaces.  Explicit PvDs may\
    \ be scoped to a\n   configuration related to a particular interface; however,\
    \ in general,\n   this does not apply.  What matters is that the PvD identity\
    \ is\n   authenticated by the node even in cases where the node has a single\n\
    \   connected interface.  The authentication of the PvD ID should meet\n   the\
    \ level required by the node policy.  Single PvD information may be\n   received\
    \ over multiple interfaces as long as the PvD ID is the same.\n   This applies\
    \ to the Router Advertisements (RAs) in which case a\n   multihomed host (that\
    \ is, with multiple interfaces) should trust a\n   message from a router on one\
    \ interface to install a route to a\n   different router on another interface.\n"
- title: 4.  Discussion of Alternate Solutions
  contents:
  - "4.  Discussion of Alternate Solutions\n   We presented many topologies in which\
    \ a host with multiple interfaces\n   or a multihomed host is connected to various\
    \ networks or Network\n   Providers, which in turn may apply ingress routing.\
    \  The scenario\n   analysis in Section 3.1 shows that in order to prevent packets\
    \ from\n   being dropped due to ingress routing, source-address-dependent\n  \
    \ routing is needed.  Also, source-address-dependent routing should be\n   supported\
    \ by routers throughout a site that has multiple egress\n   points.\n   In this\
    \ section, we provide some alternate solutions vis-a-vis the\n   scenarios presented\
    \ in Section 2.  We start with Rule 5.5 in\n   [RFC6724] for source address selection\
    \ and the scenarios it solves,\n   and then continue with solutions that state\
    \ exactly what information\n   hosts need in terms of new Router Advertisement\
    \ options for correct\n   source address selection in those scenarios.  No recommendation\
    \ is\n   made in this section.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Router Advertisement Option
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Router Advertisement Option\n   There is a need to configure the host not\
    \ only with the prefixes, but\n   also with the source prefixes that the next-hop\
    \ routers support.\n   Such a configuration may prevent the host from getting\
    \ ingress/egress\n   policy error messages such as ICMP source address failure\
    \ messages.\n   If host configuration is done using Router Advertisement messages,\n\
    \   then there is a need to define new Router Advertisement options for\n   source-address-dependent\
    \ routing.  These options include the Route\n   Prefix with Source Address/Prefix\
    \ Option.  Other options such as the\n   Next-Hop Address with the Route Prefix\
    \ Option and the Next-Hop\n   Address with the Source Address and Route Prefix\
    \ Option will be\n   considered in Section 4.2.\n   As discussed in Section 3.1,\
    \ the scenario in Figure 4 can be solved\n   by defining a new Router Advertisement\
    \ option.\n   If host configuration is done using DHCP, then there is a need to\n\
    \   define new DHCP options for Route Prefix with Source Address/Prefix.\n   As\
    \ mentioned above, DHCP server configuration is interface specific.\n   New DHCP\
    \ options for source-address-dependent routing such as route\n   prefix and source\
    \ prefix need to be configured separately for each\n   interface.\n   The scenario\
    \ in Figure 4 can be solved by defining a new DHCP option.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Router Advertisement Option Set
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Router Advertisement Option Set\n   Rule 5.5 for source address selection\
    \ may be a solution for selecting\n   the right source addresses for each next\
    \ hop, but there are cases\n   where the next-hop routers on each interface of\
    \ the host are not\n   known by the host initially.  Such use cases are out of\
    \ scope.\n   Guidelines for use cases that require the Router Advertisement option\n\
    \   set involving third-party next-hop addresses are also out of scope.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Rule 5.5 for Source Address Selection
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Rule 5.5 for Source Address Selection\n   One possible solution is Rule\
    \ 5.5 in [RFC6724], the default rule for\n   source address selection, which recommends\
    \ selecting the source\n   addresses advertised by the next hop.  Considering\
    \ the above\n   scenarios, we can state that this rule can solve the problem in\n\
    \   Figures 1, 2, and 5.\n   Source address selection rules can be distributed\
    \ by the DHCP server\n   using the DHCP option OPTION_ADDRSEL_TABLE defined in\
    \ [RFC7078].\n   In case of DHCP-based host configuration, the DHCP server can\n\
    \   configure only the interface of the host to which it is directly\n   connected.\
    \  In order for Rule 5.5 to apply on other interfaces, the\n   option should be\
    \ sent on those interfaces as well using the DHCPv6\n   address selection policy\
    \ option defined in [RFC7078].\n   Rule 5.5, the default rule for source address\
    \ selection, solves that\n   problem when an application sends a packet with an\
    \ unspecified source\n   address.  In the presence of two default routes, one\
    \ route will be\n   chosen, and Rule 5.5 will make sure that the right source\
    \ address is\n   used.\n   When the application selects a source address, i.e.,\
    \ the source\n   address is chosen before next-hop selection, even though the\
    \ source\n   address is a way for the application to select the exit point, in\n\
    \   this case, that purpose will not be served.  In the presence of\n   multiple\
    \ default routes, one will be picked, ignoring the source\n   address that was\
    \ selected by the application because it is known that\n   IPv6 implementations\
    \ are not required to remember which next hops\n   advertised which prefixes.\
    \  Therefore, the next-hop router may not be\n   the correct one, and the packets\
    \ may be filtered.\n   This implies that the hosts should register which next-hop\
    \ router\n   announced each prefix.  It is required that RAs be sent by the\n\
    \   routers and that they contain PIO on all links.  It is also required\n   that\
    \ the hosts remember the source addresses of the routers that sent\n   PIOs together\
    \ with the prefixes advertised.  This can be achieved by\n   updating redirect\
    \ rules specified in [RFC4861].  [RFC8028] further\n   elaborates this to specify\
    \ to which router a host should present its\n   transmission.\n   The source-address-dependent\
    \ routing solution is not complete without\n   support from the edge routers.\
    \  All routers in edge networks need to\n   be required to support routing based\
    \ on not only the destination\n   address but also the source address.  All edge\
    \ routers need to be\n   required to satisfy filters as defined in BCP 38.\n"
