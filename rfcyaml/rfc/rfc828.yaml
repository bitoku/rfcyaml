  - "    DATA COMMUNICATIONS:  IFIP'S INTERNATIONAL \"NETWORK\" OF EXPERTS\n     (This\
    \ report has been written for IFIP by Kenneth Owen, former\n                Technology\
    \ Editor of The Times, London)\n[ This RFC is distributed to inform the ARPA Internet\
    \ community of the\nactivities of the IFIP technical committee on Data Communications,\
    \ and\nto encourage participation in those activities. ]\nA vital common thread\
    \ which runs through virtually all current advances\nin implementing and operating\
    \ computer-based systems is that of data\ncommunications.  The interconnection\
    \ of the various elements of complete\nsystems in new ways has become the driving\
    \ force behind a substantial\nresearch and development effort.\nIn both national\
    \ and international systems, a variety of new options has\nbeen opening up in\
    \ recent years.  Increasingly the development of these\nnew systems involves people\
    \ and groups from a variety of\nbackgrounds--the computer industry, the telecommunications\
    \ industry, the\nnational telecommunications authorities and the national and\n\
    international standards bodies.\nIn an area where the formerly distinct technologies\
    \ of computing and\ntelecommunications have so clearly converged, the new technology\n\
    presents both opportunities and problems.  And this convergence of\ntechnologies\
    \ demands an \"interconnection\" also between the various\ngroups mentioned above.\n\
    For different purposes, and in different parts of the world, the\nspecific technological\
    \ solutions will vary, though drawing on the same\nbasic research and development.\
    \  Global, regional, national and local\nsystems are all involved.  Systems are\
    \ being designed at a time when the\ntechnology itself is continuing to advance\
    \ rapidly and there are many\nuncertainties in choosing the best directions fo\
    \ follow.  Nonetheless,\ninternational standards must be developed and agreed.\n\
    This background -- of interacting elements of a complex, rapidly\nadvancing technology\
    \ -- lies behind the work of Technical Committee 6\n(TC 6) of the International\
    \ Federation for Information Processing\n(IFIP).  IFIP's membership consists of\
    \ the appropriate national\nprofessional organizations, one per country, and its\
    \ aims include the\npromotion of information science and technology and the advancement\
    \ of\ninternational cooperation in this field.\nThe broad field of information\
    \ processing is subdivided for IFIP\npurposes into a number of specialist areas,\
    \ each of which is covered by\nRFC 828                                       \
    \               August 1982\none of the Federation's technical committees.  TC\
    \ 6 aims to promote the\nexchange of information about data communication; to\
    \ bridge some of the\ngaps that exist between users, telecommunications administrations\
    \ and\nthe manufactures of computers and equipment; and to cultivate working\n\
    contacts with other relevant international bodies.\nChairman of the committee\
    \ is Professor Andre Danthine of the University\nof Liege, Belgium.  \"The main\
    \ interest of TC 6\", he says, \"is to have a\nreal exchange of technical information,\
    \ on an international basis, in\ntwo ways which are completely intermixed.\" \
    \ In essence these two aspects\nreflect the respective needs of people in the\
    \ developed and the\ndeveloping nations.\nIn the developed countries where the\
    \ technology is advancing most\nrapidly, the basic need is for a full information\
    \ exchange between the\nresearchers and the professional practitioners.  The research\
    \ will\ninclude work which draws on voice and video communication; and the\npractitioners\
    \ will come from the traditional computer and\ntelecommunications industries (now\
    \ competing with each other in this\narea) and from the new \"telematics\" industry.\n\
    This interchange of ideas between experts in the developed nations is\ncomplemented\
    \ by the second category of the work of TC 6:  the\ninterchange of information\
    \ with the developing countries.  \"One of my\nmain objectives as a technical\
    \ committee chairman\", says Professor\nDanthine, \"is to try to keep a balance\
    \ between meeting the needs of the\nexpert, and the responsibility of the expert\
    \ to explain the state of the\nart to people in the developing nations.\"\nThese\
    \ \"state of the art\" or review conferences are an important part of\nthe TC\
    \ 6 programme.  Each of IFIP's technical committees is made up of\nnational representatives\
    \ (plus working group chairmen, whose work is\ndescribed later in this article);\
    \ and the strength of the TC 6\nmembership is such that, when necessary, the committee\
    \ can mount\ncomprehensive \"state of the art\" conference programmes with speakers\n\
    drawn from its own ranks.  In this role the committee is a technical\n\"travelling\
    \ circus\" -- one in which, as for IFIP activities generally,\nthe performers\
    \ receive no fees.\nThe technical committee plans its overall programme of events\
    \ and acts\nas the driving mechanism for the TC 6 activity, Professor Danthine\
    \ ponts\nout, but the programme is normally implemented by the committee's\nvarious\
    \ specialist working groups as appropriate.  The TC 6 working\ngroups are not\
    \ small subcommittees in the conventional sense of the\nterm; each is a specialist\
    \ community of perhaps 200 people who keep in\ntouch by mail (including electronic\
    \ mail).\nThe working groups embrace a range of activities.  First, there is the\n\
    RFC 828                                                      August 1982\nbasic,\
    \ routine process of information dissemination between members.\nEach working\
    \ group has a distribution system by which papers, reports\nand notes can be \"\
    broadcast\" to the group membership.  This is much\nwider in scope and more flexible\
    \ than the mechanism of meetings; it can\nbe used to report research results,\
    \ for example, prior to formal\npublication.\nSecondly, the working groups hold\
    \ informal discussion \"workshops\" at\nwhich a particular group of specialists\
    \ will try to work towards a\nconsensus.  Often timed to take place at a very\
    \ early stage in the\ndevelopment of a significant new technique or area of interest,\
    \ these\nmeetings attempt to clarify the relevant terminology and methodology\n\
    that will be needed in moving towards a full understanding of the\nsubject area.\n\
    A third activity is to hold relatively small \"working conferences\" -- an\nIFIP\
    \ term which defines a meeting of invited experts, at which each\nparticipant\
    \ presents a formal paper.  The proceedings are subsequently\npublished to disseminate\
    \ the results to the scientific world in general.\nTo gain a wider interaction\
    \ than is possible at a working conference,\nTC 6 pursues a fourth type of information\
    \ exchange, that of the\n\"in-depth symposium\".  This, as its name implies, is\
    \ a highly technical\nopen conference on a well-defined topical subject, designed\
    \ to attract\nas large an attendance as possible.  For TC 6 the in-depth symposium\
    \ is\nan annual event.\nProfessor Danthine stresses the broad range of technology\
    \ and of\ninterests that is represented on his technical committee.  And he\n\
    stresses that it is technology rather than science that interests his\nmembers.\n\
    \"We have very few people engaged in pure research in the sense that\ntheir work\
    \ is not application-oriented.  Even those who work in protocol\nverification\
    \ have some application in mind.  They try to find formal\nmethods in a way which\
    \ may be characterized as basic applied research.\nOn the other hand, when advances\
    \ are happening rapidly in computer\nscience, something which is theoretical becomes\
    \ useful very quickly.\"\nRFC 828                                            \
    \          August 1982\nLOCAL NETWORKS\nWithin data communications, no subject\
    \ has aroused more general interest\nin recent years than that of local computer\
    \ networks, triggered by the\nradical possibilities opened up by the Xerox Ethernet\
    \ system.  Within\nTC 6, the subject of local computer networks is addressed by\
    \ working\ngroup WG 6.4, chaired by Greg Hopkins of Ungerman-Bass (while Robert\n\
    Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet, is the United States representative on\nthe technical\
    \ committee).\nLocal networks show all the signs of being a \"bandwagon\" subject\
    \ at the\npresent time, with many people and organizations running to jump aboard.\n\
    The concept is not new; local networks were implemented in Canada, the\nUnited\
    \ States and Britain in the 1960s.  But the appearance of Ethernet\nstarted the\
    \ bandwagon rolling.  The message of Ethernet basically was\nthat new kinds of\
    \ network structure existed, quite different from those\nof large-area networks,\
    \ which were appropriate to very high speeds of\ntransmission and rather limited\
    \ geographical areas; and that by using\nthese high-speed networks one could reorganize\
    \ the way that one\ninterconnected all parts of a computing system in a particular\
    \ ofice, or\nlaboratory, or factory.\nThe aims of WG 6.4 are \"to organize interest\
    \ and promote the exchange of\ninformation on networks of locally distributed\
    \ digital computers\" and\n\"to develop recommendations for international standardization\
    \ of local\ncomputer networking technology\".  A good example of what this means\
    \ in\npractice was the international symposium on local computer networks,\norganized\
    \ by WG 6.4 for TC 6, which attracted more than 500 delegates to\nFlorence earlier\
    \ this year.\nThis was TC 6's \"in-depth\" event for 1982, covering such topics\
    \ as VLSI\ntechniques, network reliability, voice distribution, LCN design and\n\
    applications, performance evaluation, protocols, gateways and standards.\nAspects\
    \ of Ethernet, \"slotted\" ring networks such as the Cambridge Ring,\nand \"token\"\
    \ rings (pioneered in Canada in the mid-1960s and now the\nsubject of renewed\
    \ interest) were discussed in detail.  One of the\ninteresting developments reported\
    \ at Florence concerned work on an\nadvanced token ring at IBM's research laboratories\
    \ at Ruschlikon,\nZurich, Switzerland.\nThe relative characteristics of the Ethernet\
    \ and ring categories of\nlocal networks are still very much a matter for technical\
    \ debate.  And\nthe so-called broadband networks are a third competing category;\n\
    carrying far more information (at the cost of losing some logical\nsimplicity),\
    \ they offer the prospect of combining cable television with\ninteractive computer-based\
    \ services.\nThus the present time is one of intense marketing activity by the\n\
    RFC 828                                                      August 1982\nproponents\
    \ of the respective technologies--and so a time when the\nfullest international\
    \ exchange of information on technical developments\nis particularly important.\n\
    As interpreted by WG 6.4 local computer networks are \"local\" in that\nthey are\
    \ concerned with communication over distances between ten metres\nand 10,000 metres.\
    \  Their \"computers\" are the devices which require and\nprovide the transmission\
    \ of data in terminals and in large central\nprocessing systems.\nThe \"networks\"\
    \ may employ a variety of transmission media, including\ntwisted pairs, coaxial\
    \ cable, fibre optics and local radio.  Those of\nmost interest to WG 6.4 will\
    \ use data rates above 100 kilobits per\nsecond.  Among the major topics tackled\
    \ by the group are the role of\nprotocols in local computer networks and the interconnection\
    \ of local\ncomputer networks with remote networks.\nMESSAGING\nInternational\
    \ computer message systems and services form another rapidly\ndeveloping topic,\
    \ Messages may be processed, stored and transmitted\nbetween users who may be\
    \ within the jurisdiction of separate carriers,\ncomputer systems and/or computer\
    \ networks.  Technical, economic and\npolitical issues must be resolved if a viable\
    \ international computer\nmessage service is to develop.  Within TC 6, this is\
    \ the concern of\nworking group WG 6.5, chaired by Ronald Uhlig of Bell-Northern\
    \ Research,\nOttawa, Canada.\nThis working group concentrates on standards for\
    \ data structures,\naddressing, and higher-level protocols to effect internatioanal\n\
    computer-mediated message services, Such services could have an impact\non existing\
    \ international postal and communication agreements, and on\nthe economics of\
    \ the worldwide communication system.  Results of the\ngroup's work are made available\
    \ to users, manufacturers, common\ncarriers, PTTs, ISO and CCITT.\nOne of the\
    \ most comprehensive moves by TC 6 and WG 6.5 to influence the\ndevelopment of\
    \ international computer-based message services was the\npublication of a set\
    \ of policy recommendations which came out of a\nworking-group workshop in Bonn\
    \ in 1980 and was confirmed by the\ntechnical committee.  These concerned the\
    \ right to operate such\nservices; restrictions on transborder data flow; and\
    \ tariff issues.\nOrganizations should be free to operate their own computer-based\
    \ message\nservices and to interconnect these services for messages between\n\
    organizations through public networks, TC 6 stated.  (The aim here was\nto preserve\
    \ the basic freedom to communicate without entering into the\nRFC 828        \
    \                                              August 1982\nmore controversial\
    \ subject of third-party traffic, which is regarded\ndifferently in different\
    \ countries.)\nNo restriction should be placed on the transmission across borders\
    \ of\nmessages between persons.  If restrictions were placed on the nature of\n\
    computer-based messages transmitted across a country's borders (the\nforbidding\
    \ of encipherment, for example), then the conditions should not\nbe more severe\
    \ than those placed on letter post.  (It was appreciated\nthat restrictions on\
    \ the flow of data across borders could be regarded\nas necessary to prevent the\
    \ circumvention of national privacy laws by\nthe use of databases abroad but,\
    \ the committee argued, the remedy should\nbe to rationalize the data privacy\
    \ laws, not to restrict the data flow.)\nOn tarriff principles, TC 6 recommended\
    \ that tariff levels should not\ndiscriminate against computer-based message services,\
    \ whether public or\nprivate; there should be no heavy extra charge for international\n\
    messages; the principles of charging should not discourage the sensible,\nexpected\
    \ pattern of usage; and charges for preparation and sending of\nmessages should\
    \ be separated.  (Here the background danger was that\npublic-service tariffs\
    \ might be manipulated to achieve unfair\nobjectives, such as discouraging the\
    \ use of new services or exploiting a\nmonopoly.)\nPolicy aspects such as these\
    \ represent one of three main themes which\nare pursued within WG 6.5 in a formal\
    \ structure of sub-groups.  The\nother two themes are the systems environment\
    \ (overall systems issues of\ncomputer messaging) and the user environment (the\
    \ user interface and all\nother aspects of user involvement).  European and North\
    \ American\nsub-groups work in parallel in each of these two subject areas.\n\"\
    We started out with the realization that computer messge systems were\ncoming\
    \ along very rapidly, with many different systems appearing in\ndifferent parts\
    \ of the world, and we could see the day coming when\npeople wree going to want\
    \ all these systems to talk to each other\", says\nRonald Uhlig.  \"That wasn't\
    \ going to happen unless we started to get\npeople together.  The first ones of\
    \ the type we're talking about were on\nthe Arpanet in the United States.  For\
    \ TC 6, computer messaging was the\nsubject of the 1981 in-depth symposium which\
    \ was held in Ottawa.\"\nAn important concept of mail messaging has emerged from\
    \ WG 6.5's work on\nsystems environment.  This divides computer messages from\
    \ the systems\npoint of view into two parts, known respectively as the message\
    \ transfer\nagent and the user agent.\nThe user agent acts on behalf of the individual\
    \ user.  When the user\nwishes to send a message he initially enters the user\
    \ agent function.\nThe \"agent\" is probably software, but the concept is broad.\
    \  The user\nagent might be in a terminal, in a concentrator, in a PBX or in the\n\
    RFC 828                                                      August 1982\nnetwork.\
    \  It interacts with the user and handles everything up to the\npoint of composing\
    \ the message.\nThe user then gives the user agent instructions to send the message.\
    \  At\nthat point the message is in effect placed inside an electronic\nenvelope,\
    \ and \"posted\" to a message transfer agent.  The message may\npass from one\
    \ messge transfer agent to another before finally passing to\nthe receiving user\
    \ agent which handles functions concerned with reading\nthe message, filing it,\
    \ etc.\nThe work of WG 6.5's systems environment group led to the formal\nconsideration\
    \ of message-handling standards by a study group of CCITT.\nThe CCITT group is\
    \ concentrating at present on devising standards fo the\nprotocols for the transfer\
    \ of messages between message transfer agents.\n\"Once that becomes standardized\"\
    , says Ronald Uhlig, \"you've taken a\nmajor step towards allowing anybody's message\
    \ system to communicate with\nanybody else's.  Next we want to concentrate on\
    \ obtaining some consensus\nfor standards on compatible sets of functions in user\
    \ agents.  You can\nhave many different kinds of user agents--those which will\
    \ accept only\ntext messages, or voice messages, for example.\"\nAnother important\
    \ development within WG 6.5 which is just getting under\nway is concerned with\
    \ messaging for developing nations.  Here there are\ntwo dimensions -- national\
    \ and international.  The international problem\nis how to enable scientists (and\
    \ in particular computer scientists) in\nthe developing nations to keep in touch\
    \ with their colleagues in the\nmore advanced countries.  An international message\
    \ system could be the\nsolution.\nWithin individual developing countries there\
    \ is the possibility of using\ncomputer-based messaging as a superior type of\
    \ internal telegram\nservice.  People sending telegrams would go to a local post\
    \ office to\ndictate their messages.  Post offices would be linked in a message\n\
    system, and at the receiving office the message would be printed out and\nthen\
    \ hand-delivered.\nDr. S. Ramani of India and Professor Liane Tarouco of Brazil\
    \ are\nco-chairmen of WG 6.5's new subgroup on messaging for developing\nnations.\
    \  Dr. Ramani has suggested that India might launch a small\nsatellite into a\
    \ relatively low earth orbit, to be used for the\ntransmission of messages within\
    \ developing countries (and possibly\ninternationally).\nAnother subgroup within\
    \ WG 6.5, it has been suggested, might be formed\nto discuss messaging for the\
    \ hearing impaired.  This has been approved\nin principle, but has not yet generated\
    \ sufficient active interest for\nit to move ahead.\nRFC 828                 \
    \                                     August 1982\nThus working groups 6.4 and\
    \ 6.5 have an active, continuing programme in\nwell-defined subject areas.  TC\
    \ 6's other two working groups, 6.1 and\n6.3, are each in a state of flux at present\
    \ as they review their scope\nin order to respond to changing needs.\nPROTOCOLS\n\
    WG 6.1 has been concerned up to now with \"international packet switching\nfor\
    \ computer sharing\".  Formed in 1973 from the nucleus of an existing\nnon-IFIP\
    \ international network working group (which itself had grown out\nof a United\
    \ States network working group within the Arpanet community),\nit played a key\
    \ role in the development of communication protocols for\ncomputer networks.\n\
    The working group defined its original scope as follows.  The group\nwould study\
    \ the problems of the interworking of packet-switched computer\nnetworks planned\
    \ in various countries.  The group's ultimate goal was to\ndefine the technical\
    \ characteristics of facilities and operating\nprocedures which would make it\
    \ possible and attractive to interconnect\nsuch networks.  In pursuit of this\
    \ goal, the group would attempt to\ndefine and publish guidelines for the interconnection\
    \ of\npacket-switching networks.  Where possible, it would test the guidelines\n\
    with experimental interconnections between cooperating networks.\nThus, the mainstream\
    \ of WG 6.1 activity has been in the area of\nprotocols, an area where the emphasis\
    \ has now shifted from the\ninvestigative research and discussion of IFIP to the\
    \ follow-on work of\nthe international standards bodies.  In 1978 an in-depth\
    \ symposium on\ncomputer network protocols was held in Liege.  In 1979 an in-depth\n\
    symposium on flow control in complex data networks was held in Paris;\nthe subject\
    \ of flow control and overall network design is now regarded\nas having largely\
    \ moved out of the research area and into the area of\ncommercial exploitation.\
    \  In 1981 a workshop on formal description and\nverification techniques was held\
    \ at the National Physical Laboratory,\nTeddington, England.\nFor the outside\
    \ scientific community, WG 6.1 has thus been the focus for\nsignificant research\
    \ and information exchange.  Within TC 6 it has also\nplayed a significant role\
    \ as the parent of subgroups which have gone on\nto develop into working groups\
    \ in their own right.  For the future, it\nis the intention that WG 6.1 should\
    \ continue this latter \"umbrella\"\nrole, probably under a general \"architecture\
    \ and protocols for networks\"\ntitle, with specific new areas being hived off\
    \ into subgroups as\nappropriate.\nOne such subgroup of the new 6.1 could well\
    \ be concerned with satellite\nsystems.  At first sight it might appear a little\
    \ late for a group such\nas TC 6 to begin to turn its attention to an established\
    \ communication\nRFC 828                                                     \
    \ August 1982\nmedium such as satellite systems, but the committee has in mind\n\
    significant new variations on the satellite theme.\n\"Satellites have been used\
    \ up to now almost entirely to provide\ntelephone channels\", says Dr. Donald\
    \ Davies of the National Physical\nLaboratory, England, who is the recently elected\
    \ vice-chairman of TC 6.\n\"What we want to do now is to develop satellite systems\
    \ that will mix\nvoice and vision and data in such a way as to get the most use\
    \ out of\nthe channel.  You can very often get the best use of the channel by\n\
    mixing different types of traffic in this way.  But you get these\nadvantages\
    \ only if you're prepared to design the multiplexing system\naround the requirements.\n\
    \"Satellite Business Systems does this already to a certain extent.  But\nI believe\
    \ that new types of multiplexing schemes will be developed for\nsatellites which\
    \ will make the future generation of mixed-media\nsatellites much more powerful.\"\
    \n\"Then there's the question:  if you do have a satellite system\nintegrated\
    \ with a surface network, and then perhaps with a number of\nlocal networks, how\
    \ do you set up the hierarchy of protocols to connect\nall that together, in a\
    \ way that actually works conveniently?  That's an\nunsolved problem.\"\n\"We\
    \ know how to make a satellite into a sort of substitute telephone\nline, but\
    \ what we don't know is how to make one of these rather more\nintelligent satellite\
    \ systems work in nicely with the local network.\nThat's one of the functions\
    \ of the Universe project in the UK.\"\nAnother possible new topic which could\
    \ come under the WG 6.1 umbrella is\nthat of data security, which is the area\
    \ of research in which Dr. Davies\nis working at NPL.  It presents a difficult\
    \ technical problem, the need\nfor standards, and above all a need to anaylze\
    \ the user's requirements.\nDr. Davies points out that ring networks, Ethernet\
    \ systems and satellite\nsystems all use broadcast transmissions, with obvious\
    \ dangers of data\ninsecurity.\nHUMAN FACTORS\nWorking Group 6.3, whose title\
    \ is \"Human-computer interaction\", is also\nbeing reviewed at present for rather\
    \ different reasons.  The group was\nformed in 1975, re-formed in 1981, and has\
    \ been concerned with\ndeveloping a science and technology of the interaction\
    \ between people\nand computers.  It was concerned in particular with computer\
    \ users,\nespecially those who were not computer professionals, and with how to\n\
    improve the human-computer relationship for them.\nIdentified areas for study\
    \ included the problems people have with\nRFC 828                            \
    \                          August 1982\ncomputers; the impact of computers on\
    \ individuals and organizations; the\ndeterminants of utility, usability and acceptability;\
    \ the appropriate\nallocation of tasks between computers and people; modelling\
    \ the user as\nan aid to better system design; and harmonizing the computer to\
    \ the\ncharacteristics and needs of the user.\nClearly the scope of 6.3 was deliberately\
    \ set wide, with a tendency\ntowards general principles rather than particular\
    \ systems.  But it was\nrecognized that progress would be achieved only through\
    \ specific studies\non practical issues--for example, on interface design standards,\
    \ command\nlanguage consistency, documentation, appropriateness of alternative\n\
    communication media and human factors guidelines for dialogue design.\nChairman\
    \ of WG 6.3 in recent years has been Professor Brian Shackel of\nLoughborough\
    \ University of Technology, UK, who played the leading role\nin re-forming the\
    \ group in 1981.\nThe scope of 6.3 in fact goes beyond the scope of any single\
    \ technical\ncommittee.  It is close to that of TC 9, for example, whose subject\
    \ is\nthe relationship between computers and society; and of TC 8, which is\n\
    concerned with information systems.  Activities which cut across\nboundaries in\
    \ this way can be organized jointly by working groups from a\nnumber of TCs, but\
    \ in the case of WG 6.3 the future status of the group\nis now the subject of\
    \ an ad hoc review.\nTHE FUTURE\nLooking ahead, Professor Danthine sums up:  \"\
    I think that the most\nimportant developments that are ahead of us will involve\
    \ local networks,\nthe digital PBX, and the concept of the Integrated Services\
    \ Digital\nNetwork (ISDN).  It will be interesting to see what will finally come\n\
    out of the various pressures, coming from different directions, for the\nsame\
    \ market.  Some of the directions are technology-driven; some are\nmarketing-driven.\
    \  It is not at all clear what will happen.\n\"The role of TC 6 -- or rather the\
    \ working groups -- is to act as a\nforum where experts can advocate, and assess,\
    \ the various alternatives.\nWe do not restrict ourselves to the view of any one\
    \ sector -- the\ntelecommunications authorities, say, or the manufacturers.  We\
    \ are much\nmore open-minded, and exposed to the opinions of people who are not\n\
    necessarily from our own domain of work.\"\nOne area in which TC 6 is seeking\
    \ a fuller methodology and understanding\nis that of office automation.  \"It\
    \ is surprising to see that, at the\npresent time, we are only at the beginning\
    \ of a real understanding of\noffice work,\" says Professor Danthine, \"We have\
    \ no model.\"\nThus, following the modelling work which TC 6 did in protocols,\
    \ system\narchitectures and messaging systems, the committee chairman says, \"\
    we\nRFC 828                                                      August 1982\n\
    are now doing some modelling work in terms of office automation, in\norder to\
    \ understand what the problems are.  Very often a solution\nappears for a problem\
    \ which is not understood -- that is, not completely\ndefined.  That happens more\
    \ often than you might think in computer\nscience.\"\nThe next two years will\
    \ be important ones for data communication:  1983\nis World Communication Year,\
    \ and 1984 will be important because of the\nCCITT Integrated Services Digital\
    \ Network standards which are expected\nto be announced then.  These standards\
    \ will indicate the\ntelecommunication authorities' plans for their own \"local\
    \ networks\" (by\nwhich they mean the distribution systems at local level from\
    \ the\ntelephone exchange out to the homes, offices and factories).\nAt present\
    \ this local distribution is by multicore cable.  In future it\nwill be by glass\
    \ fibres coupled with complex electronics at the various\nnodes.  At the moment\
    \ nobody knows what these nodes will look like, nor\nwhat the actual mode of transmission\
    \ will be.  If the CCITT standards\nare announced in 1984 they will affect everybody\
    \ concerned with \"local\nnetworks\" in the computing sense.  They will influence\
    \ the design of the\nlocal computer networks of the late eighties.\nThese various\
    \ threads of development in data communication are reflected\nin TC 6's programme\
    \ of meetings for 1982-85.  Planned events include an\ninternational conference\
    \ on data communications (a \"state of the art\"\nreview) in Johannesburg, South\
    \ Africa, in September 1982; a working\nconference on interconnected personal\
    \ computing systems in Tromso,\nNorway, in 1983; an in-depth symposium on satellite\
    \ and computer\ncommunications in Paris, France, in 1983; and a working conference\
    \ on\ndata communications in ISDN in Israel in 1985.  TC 6 is also active in\n\
    providing speakers for the sixth International Conference on Computer\nCommunication\
    \ (ICCC '82)  in September 1982 in London, England.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
