the set of Telnet Options defined in Request For Comments 651 through 658 (NIC 31154 through 31161) are part of the official Telnet Options and should be added to the Protocol Notebook.
RFC 651 is a revision of the Status Option to utilize the subcommand feature and reduce the number of bits required to convey the status information.
This revised Status Option replaces the previous Status Option.
The other RFCs (652 through 658) are new Options for controlling the behavior of the format effector characters Carriage Return, Horizontal Tab, Form Feed, Vertical Tab, and Line Feed.
Your attention is also called to RFC 645 (NIC 30899) "Network Standard Data Specification Syntax" which was prepared some time ago but has not received wide circulation.
Unfortunately the Network Information Center can not provide hardcopy documents.
Currently the author is responsible for distribution of RFCs.
The documents are available online as: [ISI]<DCROCKER>STATUS
(If these files are not found online they may have been archived, in this case the files should be accessable via the "interogate" command.)
