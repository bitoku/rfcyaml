  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Dublin Core Metadata Workshop Series began in 1995 with\
    \ an\n   invitational workshop that brought together librarians, digital\n   library\
    \ researchers, content experts, and text-markup experts to\n   promote better\
    \ discovery standards for electronic resources.  The\n   resulting metadata element\
    \ set defines fifteen metadata elements for\n   resource description in a cross-disciplinary\
    \ information environment.\n   This document contains the current text of Dublin\
    \ Core \"Version 1.1\".\n   Version 1.1 is the basis of ANSI/NISO Z39.85-2001\
    \ [Z39.85].  The text\n   in the present RFC closely follows the text in the 2007\
    \ revision of\n   ANSI/NISO Z39.85, especially Sections 2-6 and 10-12 [Z39.85-2007].\n\
    \   The present RFC obsoletes RFC 2413 [RFC2413], which was the first\n   published\
    \ version of the Dublin Core (\"Version 1.0\").  The main\n   differences between\
    \ the present RFC and RFC 2413 are in the wording\n   of definitions -- for Contributor\
    \ and Date (semantically broadened),\n   for Relation (clarified), and in the\
    \ general removing of redundant\n   references to \"the content of\" a resource.\
    \  In addition, the present\n   RFC recommends lowercase element names (consistent\
    \ with RDF property\n   types), remains silent about the unrestrictedness of element\
    \ ordering\n   and repeatability (application profiles being the proper place\
    \ to\n   discuss such topics), and references the current abstract model,\n  \
    \ vocabularies, and namespace policies in which the Dublin Core is\n   embedded.\n"
- title: 2.  Foreword
  contents:
  - "2.  Foreword\n   The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is a vocabulary of fifteen\n\
    \   properties for use in resource description.  The name \"Dublin\" is due\n\
    \   to its origin at a 1995 invitational workshop in Dublin, Ohio; \"core\"\n\
    \   because its elements are broad and generic, usable for describing a\n   wide\
    \ range of resources.\n   The fifteen element \"Dublin Core\" described in this\
    \ document is part\n   of a larger set of metadata vocabularies and technical\
    \ specifications\n   maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI).\
    \  The full\n   set of vocabularies, DCMI Metadata Terms [DCTERMS], also includes\
    \ a\n   set of resource classes, the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCTYPE].  The\n   terms\
    \ in DCMI vocabularies are intended to be used in combination\n   with terms from\
    \ other compatible vocabularies in the context of\n   application profiles and\
    \ on the basis of the DCMI Abstract Model\n   [DCAM].\n   All changes made to\
    \ terms of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set\n   since 2001 have been reviewed\
    \ by a DCMI Usage Board in the context of\n   a DCMI Namespace Policy [DCNMSPC].\
    \  The namespace policy describes\n   how DCMI terms are assigned Uniform Resource\
    \ Identifiers (URIs) and\n   sets limits on the range of editorial changes that\
    \ may allowably be\n   made to the labels, definitions, and usage comments associated\
    \ with\n   existing DCMI terms.\n"
- title: 3.  Scope and Purpose
  contents:
  - "3.  Scope and Purpose\n   The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is a standard\
    \ for cross-domain\n   resource description.  As in RFC 3986 [RFC3986], \"Uniform\
    \ Resource\n   Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax\", this specification does not\
    \ limit\n   the scope of what might be a resource.\n   The elements described\
    \ in this document are typically used in the\n   context of an application profile\
    \ which constrains or specifies their\n   use in accordance with local or community-based\
    \ requirements and\n   policies.  The specification of such implementation detail\
    \ is outside\n   the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 4.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "4.  Definitions\n   DCMI -- the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, maintenance\
    \ agency for\n   Dublin Core Metadata Element Set.\n   Resource -- anything that\
    \ might be identified (the same definition as\n   in RFC 3986 and in the DCMI\
    \ Abstract Model).\n   Lifecycle of a resource -- a sequence of events that mark\
    \ the\n   development and use of a resource.  Some examples of events in a\n \
    \  lifecycle are: conception of an invention, creation of a draft,\n   revision\
    \ of an article, publication of a book, acquisition by a\n   library, transcription\
    \ to magnetic disk, migration to optical\n   storage, translation into English,\
    \ and derivation of a new work\n   (e.g., a movie).\n"
- title: 5.  The Element Set
  contents:
  - "5.  The Element Set\n   In the element descriptions below, each element has a\
    \ descriptive\n   label (\"label\") for human consumption and a unique token (\"\
    name\") for\n   use in machine processing.\n   In accordance with the DCMI Namespace\
    \ Policy [DCNMSPC], the \"name\" of\n   an element is appended to a DCMI namespace\
    \ URI to construct a Uniform\n   Resource Identifier as a globally unique identifier\
    \ for that element.\n   The use of element names and URIs in the context of different\n\
    \   implementation technologies is explained in DCMI Encoding Guidelines\n   [DCENCOD].\n"
