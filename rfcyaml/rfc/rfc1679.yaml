  - "Executive Summary\n   The Navy's High Performance Network (HPN) working group\
    \ has studied\n   the requirements of mission critical applications on Navy platforms.\n\
    \   Based on this study, three basic categories of issues for IPng have\n   been\
    \ identified.  The assumptions identified include accommodation of\n   current\
    \ functionality, commercial viability, and transitioning. The\n   general requirements\
    \ identified include addressing, integrated\n   services architecture, mobility,\
    \ multicast, and rapid route\n   reconfiguration. Finally, the additional considerations\
    \ identified\n   include fault tolerance, policy based routing, security, and\
    \ time\n   synchroniztion. The HPN working group is interested in participating\n\
    \   with the IETF in the development of standards which would apply to\n   mission\
    \ critical systems. In particular, the HPN working group is\n   interested in\
    \ the development of multicast functionality, an\n   integrated services architecture,\
    \ and support for high performance\n   subnetworks.\n"
- title: 1.   Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.   Introduction\n   The HPN working group has been established to study future\
    \ network\n   architectures for mission critical applications aboard Navy\n  \
    \ platforms.  As a result, the HPN working group is interested in the\n   results\
    \ of the IPng selection and development process. This document\n   is a product\
    \ of discussions within the HPN working group.\n   The purpose of this document\
    \ is to provide what the HPN working group\n   perceives as requirements for an\
    \ IPng protocol set. Many of the\n   necessary capabilities exist in current Internet\
    \ and ISO network\n   protocols; however, the HPN working group has identified\
    \ needed\n   capabilities that are beyond the existing standards.\n   The HPN\
    \ working group has identified three categories of topics for\n   discussion in\
    \ this document. The first category is assumptions or\n   those topics that the\
    \ HPN working group believes the IPng process\n   will solve satisfactorily without\
    \ specific Navy input. The second\n   category is general requirements. These\
    \ are capabilities that are\n   felt to be insufficiently addressed in existing\
    \ network protocols and\n   of key importance to Navy mission critical applications.\
    \ Finally, a\n   set of additional considerations has been identified. These are\
    \ also\n   issues of importance to the HPN working group. However, no guidance\n\
    \   or specific requests can be provided at this time.\n"
- title: 2.   Background
  contents:
  - "2.   Background\n   The US Navy has set up a program through the Space and Naval\
    \ Warfare\n   Systems Command called the Next Generation Computer Resources (NGCR)\n\
    \   Program. The purpose of this program is to identify the evolving\n   needs\
    \ for information system technology in Navy mission critical\n   systems. The\
    \ NGCR High Performance Network (HPN) working group was\n   recently established\
    \ by the NGCR program to examine high performance\n   networks for use on future\
    \ Navy platforms (aircraft, surface ships,\n   submarines, and certain shore-based\
    \ applications). This working group\n   is currently reviewing Navy needs. The\
    \ requirements provided below\n   are based on the HPN working group's current\
    \ understanding of these\n   Navy application areas. The application areas of\
    \ interest are further\n   examined below. The time frame for design, development,\
    \ and\n   deployment of HPN based systems and subsystems is 1996 into the\n  \
    \ twenty first century.\n   Three general problem domains have been identified\
    \ by the HPN working\n   group. These are the particular problem domains within\
    \ a mission\n   critical environment that the HPN working group is targeting.\
    \ The\n   first is a distributed combat system environment.  This problem\n  \
    \ domain is analogous to a collection of workstations involved in many\n   varied\
    \ applications involving multiple sources and types of\n   information.  Analog,\
    \ audio, digital, discrete, graphic, textual,\n   video, and voice information\
    \ must be coordinated in order to present\n   a single concise view to a commander,\
    \ operator, or any end user. The\n   second problem area highlights the general\
    \ internetworking\n   environment. The task of moving information to many heterogeneous\n\
    \   systems over various subnetworks is addressed. Finally, the problem\n   of\
    \ providing a high speed interconnect for devices such as sensors\n   and signal\
    \ processors is identified. [1]\n"
- title: 2.1   Application Area
  contents:
  - "2.1   Application Area\n   The application area of HPN is the communication network\
    \ which is a\n   component of the mission critical systems of Navy platforms.\
    \ The\n   expected end points or users of the HPN include humans, computers,\n\
    \   and the many devices (cameras, etc.) found on such platforms. The\n   function\
    \ of these end points includes sensor input, signal\n   processors, operator consoles,\
    \ navigation systems, etc. The endpoints\n   are typically grouped into systems\
    \ both on platforms and at shore-\n   based sites. These systems perform functions\
    \ including long range\n   planning, analysis of sensor information, and machinery\
    \ control in\n   real-time.\n   Information types that have been identified as\
    \ required by the HPN\n   working group include voice, live and pre-recorded audio\
    \ ranging from\n   voice to CD quality (e.g., from sensors), video (1 to 30 frames\
    \ per\n   second in both monochrome and color), image data (static or from\n \
    \  real-time sensors), reliable and connectionless data transfer, and\n   very\
    \ high-bandwidth (gigabits per second) unprocessed sensor data.\n"
- title: 2.2   Services
  contents:
  - "2.2   Services\n   Another way of categorizing the HPN application area is by\n\
    \   considering the user services that need to be supported. Some of\n   these\
    \ services are the following:\n     1.   process to process message passing\n\
    \     2.   distributed file and database manipulation\n     3.   e-mail (both\
    \ within the platform and off the platform)\n     4.   teleconferencing (with\
    \ the platform, between platforms, and\n          across the Internet)\n     5.\
    \   video monitoring of various physical environments\n     6.   voice distribution\
    \ (as a minimum between computer processes\n          and people)\n     7.   image\
    \ services\n     8.   time synchronization\n     9.   name or directory services\n\
    \     10.  network and system management\n     11.  security services (support\
    \ of multilevel data security,\n          privacy and protection)\n"
- title: 3.   Assumptions
  contents:
  - "3.   Assumptions\n   The assumptions documented below are concerns that the HPN\
    \ working\n   group presumes will be accommodated in the IPng process.  However,\n\
    \   they are of enough importance to this working group to merit\n   identification.\n"
- title: 3.1   Accommodation of Current Functionality
  contents:
  - "3.1   Accommodation of Current Functionality\n   The IPng protocols need to provide\
    \ for at least the existing\n   functionality. In particular, the following issues\
    \ have been\n   identified.\n     1)   The IPng protocols need to provide for\
    \ the basic\n          connectionless transfer of information from one end-point\
    \ to\n          another.\n     2)   The IPng protocols need to support multiple\
    \ subnetwork\n          technologies. This includes but is not limited to Ethernet,\n\
    \          FDDI, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Fiber Channel, and\n      \
    \    Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI). These are the subnetwork\n          technologies\
    \ that are of particular interest to the HPN\n          working group. Ideally,\
    \ IPng protocols should be subnetwork\n          independent.\n     3)   The IPng\
    \ protocols need to support hosts that may be\n          multihomed. Multihomed\
    \ in this context implies that a single\n          host may support multiple different\
    \ subnetwork technologies.\n          Multihomed hosts must have the capability\
    \ to steer the traffic\n          to selected subnetworks.\n     4)   The IPng\
    \ process needs to recognize that IPng may be only one\n          of several network\
    \ protocols that a host utilizes.\n     5)   The IPng process needs to provide\
    \ for appropriate network\n          management in the finished product. Network\
    \ management is of\n          vital importance to the applications of interest\
    \ to the HPN\n          working group.\n"
- title: 3.2   Commercial Viability
  contents:
  - "3.2   Commercial Viability\n   As is the case in the commercial world, the HPN\
    \ working group feels\n   strongly that the IPng protocols must be commercially\
    \ viable. This\n   includes but is not limited to the following issues:\n    \
    \ 1)   The IPng protocols must function correctly. The Navy cannot\n         \
    \ afford to have network protocol problems in mission critical\n          systems.\
    \ There must be a high degree of confidence that the\n          protocols are\
    \ technically sound and multi-vendor\n          interoperability is achievable.\n\
    \     2)   The IPng protocols must have the support of the\n          commercial/industrial\
    \ community. This may first be\n          demonstrated by a strong consensus within\
    \ the IETF community.\n"
- title: 3.3   Transition Plan
  contents:
  - "3.3   Transition Plan\n   The Navy has a large number of existing networks including\
    \ both\n   Internet and ISO protocols as well as a number of proprietary\n   systems.\
    \  As a minimum, the IPng effort must address how to\n   transition from existing\
    \ IP based networks. Additionally, it would be\n   desirable to have some guidance\
    \ for transitioning from other network\n   protocols including, but not limited\
    \ to, CLNP and other commonly used\n   network protocols. The transition plan\
    \ for IPng needs to recognize\n   the large existing infrastructure and the lack\
    \ of funds for a full\n   scale immediate transition. There will, in all likelihood,\
    \ be a long\n   period of co-existence that should be addressed.\n"
- title: 4.   General Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.   General Requirements\n   The general requirements documented below are topics\
    \ that the HPN\n   working group considers to be of vital importance in a network\n\
    \   protocol solution. It is hoped that the IPng solution will address\n   all\
    \ of these issues.\n"
- title: 4.1   Addressing
  contents:
  - "4.1   Addressing\n   The HPN working group has identified initial addressing\
    \ requirements.\n   First, a large number of addresses are required.  In particular,\
    \ the\n   number of addressable entities on a single platform will range from\n\
    \   the 100's to 100,000. The number of large platforms (ships,\n   submarines,\
    \ shore based sites) will range from a few hundred to\n   several thousand. In\
    \ addition, there will be 500 to 1000 or more\n   small platforms, primarily aircraft.\
    \  Since it is expected that in\n   the future many of these platforms will be\
    \ connected to global\n   networks, the addresses must be globally unique.\n \
    \  The second requirement identified is for some form of addressing\n   structure.\
    \ It is felt that this structure should be flexible enough\n   to allow for logical\
    \ structures (not necessarily geographical) to be\n   applied. It is also felt\
    \ that this is important for the\n   implementation of efficient routing solutions.\
    \  In addition, the\n   addressing structure must support multicast group addressing.\
    \ At a\n   minimum 2**16 globally unique multicast groups must be\n   distinguishable\
    \ per platform.\n"
- title: 4.2   Integrated Services Architecture
  contents:
  - "4.2   Integrated Services Architecture\n   An important goal of the HPN working\
    \ group is to identify existing\n   and emerging technologies which provide mechanisms\
    \ for integrating\n   the services required by mission critical Navy systems.\
    \ The HPN\n   working group has identified two classes of problems under the\n\
    \   general category of integrated services. The first is to provide for\n   the\
    \ multiple types of services identified in section 2.1.  It is\n   required to\
    \ support these services in an integrated fashion in order\n   to be able to correlate\
    \ (in time) related streams of information.\n   The second class of problems relates\
    \ to the predictable management of\n   the various traffic flows associated with\
    \ the above identified\n   services.  While many of these services require the\
    \ delivery of a PDU\n   within a specified time window, the applications in a\
    \ mission\n   critical environment can demand more stringent requirements. In\
    \ areas\n   where real-time systems are in use, such as machinery control,\n \
    \  narrower and/or more predictable delivery windows may be required\n   than\
    \ in the case of the delivery of audio or video streams. The\n   mission critical\
    \ environment also requires the ability to assign\n   end-to-end importance to\
    \ instances of communications (i.e.,\n   invocations of a particular service).\
    \ For example, an ongoing video\n   stream may need to yield to machinery control\
    \ commands to ensure that\n   the commands are received before their deadline.\
    \  The expense of this\n   action is to degrade temporarily the video stream quality.\n\
    \   The HPN working group is looking for mechanisms in the IPng protocols\n  \
    \ to provide for both of these classes of problems in an integrated\n   fashion.\
    \  An integrated services architecture reduces design and\n   integration complexities\
    \ by providing a uniform set of tools for use\n   by the mission critical system\
    \ designer and application developer.\n   Finally, the integrated services architecture\
    \ must be flexible and\n   scalable so that new services can be added in the future\
    \ with minimum\n   impact on systems using it.  The HPN working group has intentionally\n\
    \   avoided mentioning particular mechanisms that can be used to solve\n   some\
    \ of these problems in order to avoid requiring a particular\n   solution.\n"
- title: 4.3   Mobility
  contents:
  - "4.3   Mobility\n   The HPN working group has identified two classes of mobility\
    \ for the\n   Navy mission critical environment. First, most platforms are\n \
    \  themselves mobile. As these platforms move from port to port or from\n   flight\
    \ deck to flight deck, it is important that they are able to\n   communicate with\
    \ a number of defense installations via a general\n   infrastructure.  Additionally,\
    \ it is feasible that systems within a\n   single platform may be mobile. Maintenance\
    \ and damage assessment\n   requires large amounts of information at numerous\
    \ locations on a\n   platform. This information could possibly be made available\
    \ through\n   mobile terminals.\n"
- title: 4.4   Multicast
  contents:
  - "4.4   Multicast\n   Multicast transfer is a very critical IPng requirement for\
    \ the Navy's\n   mission critical systems. Aboard a Naval platform there are many\n\
    \   hosts (e.g., workstations) connected via numerous subnetworks. These\n   hosts\
    \ are all working different aspects of the problem of keeping the\n   platform\
    \ operational to perform its mission. In support of this\n   environment, multicast\
    \ transfer is needed to share data that is\n   needed by multiple hosts. For example,\
    \ aboard a ship platform,\n   environmental data (roll, pitch, heading...) is\
    \ needed by almost all\n   systems. Video conferencing may be used for communication\
    \ among\n   operational personnel at multiple places aboard this ship. Video\n\
    \   conferencing could also be used for communicating with personnel on\n   other\
    \ platforms or at shore facilities.  Both of these examples, in\n   addition to\
    \ a number of DoD and NATO studies, have highlighted the\n   need for multicast\
    \ functionality in mission critical systems.\n   One of the limiting factors with\
    \ the present IP version 4 multicast\n   is the optional nature of this multicast,\
    \ particularly with respect\n   to routers. The use of tunnels, while enabling\
    \ the initial deployment\n   of multicast in the Internet, appears to limit its\
    \ potential. The HPN\n   working group believes that the best approach to provision\
    \ of\n   multicast functionality is to consider it as a basic functionality to\n\
    \   be provided by IPng. In addition, sensible mechanisms are needed to\n   control\
    \ multicast traffic (i.e., scope control). Finally, support is\n   required to\
    \ enable multicast functionality in IPng in areas such as\n   group addressing\
    \ and scalable multicast routing.\n"
- title: 4.5   Rapid Route Reconfiguration
  contents:
  - "4.5   Rapid Route Reconfiguration\n   The HPN project will be using very high\
    \ bandwidth subnetwork\n   technology.  In the mission critical environment one\
    \ very important\n   problem is placing a very low bound on the time it takes\
    \ to identify\n   a subnetwork problem and to complete the necessary route\n \
    \  reconfigurations. The Navy's mission critical environment needs to be\n   able\
    \ to trade-off bandwidth to enable a short\n   detection/reconfiguration time\
    \ on subnetwork faults. A maximum bound\n   on this time is felt to be less than\
    \ 1 second.\n"
- title: 5.   Additional considerations
  contents:
  - "5.   Additional considerations\n   This section represents additional concerns\
    \ of the mission critical\n   environment which may impact IPng. The HPN working\
    \ group felt that\n   these issues are important for the mission critical environment;\n\
    \   however, it was not clear how or whether it is necessary to\n   accommodate\
    \ them in IPng solutions. It may suffice that designers of\n   IPng are aware\
    \ of these issues and therefore do not preclude\n   reasonable solutions to these\
    \ problems.\n"
- title: 5.1   Fault Tolerance
  contents:
  - "5.1   Fault Tolerance\n   The mission critical environment is particularly sensitive\
    \ to the\n   area of fault tolerance. Any mechanisms that can be accommodated\n\
    \   within the IPng protocol set, including routing and management, to\n   support\
    \ various levels of fault tolerance are desirable. In\n   particular, the following\
    \ features should be supported: error\n   detection, error reporting, traffic\
    \ analysis, and status reporting.\n"
- title: 5.2   Policy Based Routing
  contents:
  - "5.2   Policy Based Routing\n   The HPN working group feels that there may be\
    \ some uses for policy\n   based routing within the Navy's mission critical systems.\
    \  The\n   primary interest is in support of a very capable security facility.\n\
    \   Other uses discussed are as a means for keeping certain types of data\n  \
    \ on certain subnetworks (for multiply homed hosts) and providing for\n   automatic\
    \ reconfiguration in the event of particular subnetwork\n   failures.\n"
- title: 5.3   Security
  contents:
  - "5.3   Security\n   Security is an important requirement for most Navy applications\
    \ and\n   thus the ability for the network functions to be designed to support\n\
    \   security services are essential. The following are several security\n   services\
    \ in particular that the HPN working group believes the\n   network function should\
    \ be able to support:  rule based access\n   control, labeling, authentication,\
    \ audit, connection oriented and\n   connectionless confidentiality, selective\
    \ routing, traffic flow\n   confidentiality, connection oriented and connectionless\
    \ integrity,\n   denial of service protection, continuity of operations, and\n\
    \   precedence/preemption.  In addition to these services, the network\n   function\
    \ should also support the security management of these\n   security services.\
    \ In particular, key management is of importance.\n   Currently, the IPSEC of\
    \ the IETF has several draft memos being\n   considered to incorporate various\
    \ security services in the network\n   functions. It is of concern to the HPN\
    \ working group that the IPng be\n   able to support the concepts currently being\
    \ developed by the IPSEC\n   and also provide the ability for the addition of\
    \ future security\n   services.\n"
- title: 5.4   Time Synchronization
  contents:
  - "5.4   Time Synchronization\n   Time synchronization among the various components\
    \ of mission critical\n   systems is of vital importance to the Navy. It is desirable\
    \ to be\n   able to synchronize systems on multiple subnetworks via a network\n\
    \   layer infrastructure. Some hooks for time synchronization can be\n   envisioned\
    \ in the network layer.  However, the HPN working group\n   feels that, as a minimum,\
    \ efficient time synchronization algorithms\n   must be able to function above\
    \ an IPng infrastructure. For HPN\n   systems, it is desirable that a time-of-day\
    \ synchronization\n   capability be supported of at least an accuracy of one microsecond\n\
    \   among all hosts in a platform or campus network. The IPng protocols\n   should\
    \ not arbitrarily prevent this type of synchronization\n   capability.\n"
