  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multi-link PPP [MP] allows a dial-in user to open multiple\
    \ PPP\n   connections to a given host.  In general, this is done on an on-\n \
    \  demand basis.  That is, a secondary link, or multiple secondary\n   links,\
    \ are established when the data load on the primary link, and\n   any previously\
    \ established secondary links, nears capacity.  As the\n   load decreases, the\
    \ secondary link(s) may be disconnected.\n   Many dial-in hosts which support\
    \ multi-link PPP dial the same phone\n   number for all links.  This implies that\
    \ there exists a rotary at the\n   Point Of Presence (POP) which routes incoming\
    \ calls to a bank of\n   modems.  These may be physically independent modems connected\
    \ to\n   Remote Access Server (RAS) and a rotary of analog phone lines, or a\n\
    \   RAS with internal modems connected to analog lines or a T1/E1 or\n   T3/E3\
    \ channel.  In any case, a given RAS can only handle just so many\n   simultaneous\
    \ connections.  A typical POP may need to support hundreds\n   of connections,\
    \ but no RAS today can handle that many.  This creates\n   a problem when a user's\
    \ primary PPP connection is established to one\n   RAS in a POP and a secondary\
    \ connection is established to another.\n   This may occur because the first RAS\
    \ has no available modems, or\n   because incoming calls are assigned to ports\
    \ in a round-robin\n   fashion, for example, and the second call is simply assigned\
    \ to\n   another RAS.\n   The solution to this problem is to provide a mechanism\
    \ by which a RAS\n   can determine if a Multi-link PPP connection is a primary\
    \ or\n   secondary and, if a secondary, where the Bundle Head (the process\n \
    \  within a RAS which reassembles the PPP fragments transmitted over the\n   primary\
    \ and secondary links) resides.  If the Bundle Head resides on\n   a different\
    \ RAS, a protocol must be used to transfer the PPP\n   fragments to the RAS containing\
    \ the Bundle Head so that the PPP frame\n   can be reassembled.\n   Section 2\
    \ of this document specifies the Discovery Mechanism.\n   Section 3 specifies\
    \ the Transfer Protocol.  Section 4 specifies the\n   configuration parameters\
    \ needed for the Discovery Protocol.\n"
- title: 2.  Bundle Head Discovery Mechanism
  contents:
  - "2.  Bundle Head Discovery Mechanism\n   When a user dials into a RAS and negotiates\
    \ Multi-link PPP (MP)\n   during the Link Control Protocol (LCP) phase, the RAS\
    \ must determine\n   which one of the following three cases exists:\n   1- This\
    \ is the primary (first) link of the MP connection.  In this\n      case, the\
    \ RAS should create the Bundle Head.\n   2- This is a secondary link of the MP\
    \ connection and the Bundle Head\n      resides on this RAS.  In this case, the\
    \ RAS should add the link to\n      the Bundle (standard MP).\n   3- This is a\
    \ secondary link of the MP connection and the Bundle Head\n      resides on a\
    \ different RAS.  In this case, the RAS should\n      establish a path (see section\
    \ 3) to the RAS that has the Bundle\n      Head, and use that path to transfer\
    \ MP fragments.\n   In operation, a RAS will make the determination for case 2\
    \ first\n   (because it is the easiest and requires no communication with other\n\
    \   RASes.  If the Bundle Head is not local, the Discovery Protocol is\n   used\
    \ to determine where the Bundle Head is, if it exists at all.\n"

    \ of, and legal values for, the\n      fields in the endpoint ID are defined in\

    \ this implies that a RAS may not use its IP or Ethernet\n   address as an EPD.\
    \  This also implies that all RASes on a rotary must\n   have the same EPD.  RASes\
    \ on different rotaries may share different\n   EPDs.  The Local EPD is included\
    \ in the endpoint identifier to ensure\n   that RASes on different rotaries, but\
    \ sharing a common Ethernet, will\n   not join a particular discovery if the Remote\
    \ EPDs just happen to be\n   the same.\n   Except for unicast Response Messages,\
    \ all messages are sent to the\n   multicast address specified in \"IANA Considerations\"\
    .  If a system\n   cannot send multicast messages, the limited broadcast address\n\
    \   (255.255.255.255) should be used.\n"
- title: 2.2 Endpoint Identifier Matching
  contents:
  - "2.2 Endpoint Identifier Matching\n   Comparing Endpoint IDs can be time consuming.\
    \  First, the classes of\n   the EPDs must be determined, then the values compared.\
    \  These\n   comparisons might be fast arithmetic compares or slow octet-wise\n\
    \   compares of 20-octet long values.  To improve performance, because\n   the\
    \ protocol is time-driven, the hash field may be used for a fast\n   comparison.\n\
    \   When a Bundle Head is created, the hash is created and stored along\n   with\
    \ the Endpoint ID.  When a Query or Response Message is generated,\n   the hash\
    \ is created and stored in the message.  When a RAS receives a\n   message, it\
    \ can do a quick comparison of the hash in the message to\n   the hashes in its\
    \ tables.  If a hash does not match, the Endpoint ID\n   cannot match.  However,\
    \ if a hash does match, the Endpoint IDs must\n   be properly compared to verify\
    \ the match.\n   Obviously, there is a cost associated with creating the hashes,\
    \ but\n   they are created only once per message and once for each Bundle Head\n\
    \   creation.  However, the comparisons occur multiple times in multiple\n   RASes\
    \ for each new secondary connection.  Therefore, there is a net\n   savings in\
    \ processing.\n"
- title: 2.3 Protocol Operation
  contents:
  - "2.3 Protocol Operation\n   Throughout this section, configurable variables are\
    \ specified by\n   their names (e.g., ROBUSTNESS refers to the number of transmits).\n\
    \   The Discovery Protocol begins by multicasting ROBUSTNESS Query\n   Messages\
    \ at QUERY_INTERVAL intervals.  If no Response Message for\n   that Request is\
    \ received within QUERY_INTERVAL of the last broadcast\n   (a total time of ROBUSTNESS\
    \ * QUERY_INTERVAL), the RAS assumes that\n   this is the primary link and begins\
    \ to build the Bundle Head.  It\n   then sends a multicast Response Message (in\
    \ case another link comes\n   up after the time-out but before the Bundle Head\
    \ is built).  If a\n   Response Message is received (i.e., a Bundle Head exists\
    \ on another\n   RAS), no additional Query Messages are sent and the RAS establishes\
    \ a\n   path to the RAS containing the Bundle Head.\n   If a RAS receives a Query\
    \ Message for an MP connection for which it\n   has the Bundle Head, it sends\
    \ a unicast Response Message to the\n   querier.  Note that no repetition of the\
    \ Response Message is\n   necessary because, if it is lost, the querier's next\
    \ query message\n   will trigger a new Response Message.\n"
- title: 2.4 Contention Handling
  contents:
  - "2.4 Contention Handling\n   If, while sending Query Messages, a Query Message\
    \ for the same MP\n   connection is received, it indicates that the Dial-in Node\
    \ has\n   brought up multiple links simultaneously.  The resolution to this\n\
    \   contention is to elect the bundle head.  To do this, each RAS waits\n   until\
    \ all Query Messages are sent (ROBUSTNESS * QUERY_INTERVAL).  At\n   that time,\
    \ the RAS with the lowest Random ID becomes the Bundle Head.\n   If two or more\
    \ RASes have the same Random ID, the RAS with the lowest\n   IP address becomes\
    \ the Bundle Head.  That RAS then sends TWO Response\n   Messages, with a QUERY_INTERVAL\
    \ interval, and indicates to the MP\n   process that a Bundle Head should be formed.\
    \  When the other RAS(es)\n   receive the Response Message, they cease broadcasting\
    \ (if they\n   haven't already sent ROBUSTNESS Query Messages), stop listening\
    \ for\n   additional Response Messages, and indicate to their respective MP\n\
    \   processes where the Bundle Head resides.\n   Note that a RAS generates a Random\
    \ ID for each connection and uses\n   that value for all Query and Response messages\
    \ associated with that\n   connection.  The same Random ID must not be reused\
    \ until it can be\n   guaranteed that another RAS will not mistake the message\
    \ for an old\n   message from a previous connection.  For this reason, it is\n\
    \   recommended that the Random ID be either monotonically increasing or\n   a\
    \ clock value (either time since boot or time of day).\n"
- title: 2.5 MP Operation
  contents:
  - "2.5 MP Operation\n   MP must use the following algorithm to ensure that there\
    \ are no\n   windows of vulnerability during which multiple Bundle Heads might\
    \ be\n   created for the same MP connection.\n   When an MP link is negotiated,\
    \ MP first checks to see if it already\n   has the Bundle Head for this connection\
    \ (i.e., is this a secondary\n   link).  If it does, it should attach to it and\
    \ not initiate a\n   discovery.  As an optimization, if MP does not have a Bundle\
    \ Head for\n   this connection, but does have a existing secondary link for it,\
    \ MP\n   should attach to the known Bundle Head without initiating discovery.\n\
    \   If MP knows of no Bundle Head for this connection, it should initiate\n  \
    \ a discovery.  If the discovery should locate a Bundle Head, it should\n   attach\
    \ to the indicated bundle head.  If no Bundle Head is found, MP\n   should create\
    \ a Bundle Head.\n   When a RAS determines that it is to become the Bundle Head\
    \ for a\n   connection, it should establish the Bundle Head as quickly as\n  \
    \ possible so Query Messages for that connection from other RASes will\n   be\
    \ recognized.  If a RAS indicates that it will become the Bundle\n   Head, but\
    \ delays establishment of it, other RASes may time out on\n   their discovery\
    \ and begin to establish additional Bundle Heads of\n   their own.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   No security is designed into the Discovery Mechanism.\
    \  When not\n   forwarding multicast packets (or when using the limited broadcast\n\
    \   address), the discovery packets are restricted to a single LAN.  If\n   the\
    \ LAN is physically secure, there is no need for software security.\n   If the\
    \ multicast packets are forwarded, but the range is limited to a\n   small, physically\
    \ secure network (e.g., a POP), there is still no\n   need for software security.\
    \  If the discovery packets are allowed to\n   cross an internet (and this is\
    \ NOT recommended for timing reasons),\n   authentication of RASes may be done\
    \ with IPSEC.  For increased\n   security on a LAN, or in a POP, IPSEC may still\
    \ be used.\n   L2TP security is discussed in [L2TP].\n"
