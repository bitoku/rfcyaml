Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) based management of PacketCable  and IPCablecom compliant Multimedia Terminal Adapter devices.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
A multimedia terminal adapter (MTA) is used to deliver broadband Internet, data, and/or voice access jointly with telephony service to a subscriber's or customer's premises using a cable network infrastructure.
An MTA is normally installed at the customer's or subscriber's premises, and it is coupled to a multiple system operator (MSO) using a hybrid fiber coax (HFC) access network.
An MTA is provisioned by the MSO for broadband Internet, data, and/or voice service.
For more information on MTA provisioning, refer to the PacketCable Provisioning Specification [PKT SP PROV] and [RFC4682].
MTA devices include one or more endpoints (e.g., telephone ports), which receive call signaling information to establish ring cadence, and codecs used for providing telephony service.
For more information on call signaling, refer to the PacketCable Signaling Specification [PKT SP MGCP] and [RFC3435].
For more information on codecs refer to the PacketCable Audio/Video Codecs Specification [PKT SP CODEC].
Telephone systems are typically very complex and often have a wide distribution.
It is therefore important for management systems to support MTAs from multiple vendors at the same time, including those from multiple countries.
This MIB module provides objects suitable for managing signaling for MTA devices in the widest possible range of markets.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
The terms "MIB module" and "information module" are used interchangeably in this memo.
As used here, both terms refer to any of the three types of information modules defined in Section 3 of RFC 2578 [RFC2578].
An MTA is a PacketCable or IPCablecom compliant device providing telephony services over a cable or hybrid system used to deliver video signals to a community.
It contains an interface to endpoints, a network interface, codecs, and all signaling and encapsulation functions required for Voice over IP transport, call signaling, and Quality of Service signaling.
An MTA can be an embedded or standalone device.
An Embedded MTA (E MTA) is an MTA device containing an embedded Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) Cable Modem.
A Standalone MTA (S MTA) is an MTA device separated from the DOCSIS Cable Modem by non DOCSIS Media Access Control (MAC) interface (e.g., Ethernet, USB).
An endpoint or MTA endpoint is a standard telephony physical port located on the MTA and used for attaching the telephone device to the MTA.
The L line package refers to the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) package for the core signaling functionality, as defined by PacketCable and IPCablecom.
An MTA provides all L package elements: however, the operator determines their application.
The E line package refers to the MGCP package extensions, over and above the core L package, defined in support of international requirements.
E line package elements are optional, vary from country to country, and are set by operator or regulatory requirements.
This MIB module provides a set of objects required for Multimedia Terminal Adapter (MTA) devices compliant with the PacketCable and IPCablecom signaling specifications published by CableLabs, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU T)
compliant Multimedia Terminal Adapter (MTA) devices.
The Signaling MIB module (PKTC IETF SIG MIB) is intended to update various Signaling MIB modules from which it is partly derived: the PacketCable 1.0 Signaling MIB Specification
[PKT SP MIB SIG 1.0], the PacketCable 1.5 Signaling MIB Specification [PKT SP MIB SIG 1.5], the ITU T
Signaling MIB requirements [ITU T J169], the ETSI Signaling MIB
[ETSI TS 101 909 9].
The ETSI Signaling MIB requirements also refer to various signal characteristics defined in [ETSI TS 101 909 4], [ETSI EN 300 001], [ETSI EN 300 659 1], [ETSI EN 300 324 1] and [ETSI TR 101 183].
Several normative and informative references are used to help define Signaling MIB objects.
As a convention, wherever PacketCable and IPCablecom requirements are equivalent, the PacketCable reference is used in the object REFERENCE clause.
compliant MTA devices MUST use the equivalent IPCablecom references.
This MIB module describes the various Signaling MIB objects that are directly related to the PacketCable MTA and the endpoints supported on the MTA, each of which provides services independently.
The recognition and distinction of the endpoints are made by utilizing the ifTable (IF MIB [RFC2863]), where each index (ifIndex) value refers to a unique endpoint.
This MIB module also utilizes the syntax definition of the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) from DIFFSERV DSCP TC
[RFC3289] for defining MIB objects that allow for differentiation between various types of traffic in the service provider network.
This MIB module is identified by pktcIetfSigMib and is structured into two major parts:
Signaling information that controls device and endpoint configuration (pktcSigMibObjects)
The following sections explain each part in further detail.
It is to be noted that future enhancements to specify Notification Objects are also allowed (pktcSigNotification).
This is further divided into device specific elements (pktcSigDevObjects) and endpoint specific elements (pktcSigEndPntConfigObjects).
Some highlights of the device specific elements are as follows: pktcSigDevCodecTable this object identifies the codec types available on the device.
pktcSigDevEchoCancellation this object identifies the capability of echo cancellation on the device.
pktcSigDevSilenceSuppression this object specifies if the device is capable of silence suppression (Voice Activity Detection).
pktcSigPulseSignalTable this table selects the various signals used in the application of the metering pulse signal to the twisted pair line.
pktcSigDevToneTable this table specifies a flexible structure within which to specify all of the tones used in the MTA.
pktcSigDevMultiFreqToneTable this table defines the characteristics of tones with multiple frequencies.
Each entry in this table represents the frequency reference of a multi frequency tone.
The endpoint specific elements are mostly confined to the Endpoint configuration MIB table (pktcSigEndPntConfigTable).
This table describes the MTA endPoint configuration.
The number of entries in this table represents the number of provisioned endpoints.
pktcSigConformance pktcSigDeviceGroup this group contains all the MIB objects that apply on a per device basis and need to be implemented by an MTA to claim compliance with the specified MIB module.
pktcSigEndpointGroup this group contains all the MIB objects that apply on a per endpoint basis and need to be implemented by an MTA to claim compliance with the specified MIB module.
pktcLLinePackageGroup this group contains the MIB objects that need to be implemented to support the L line package.
pktcELinePackageGroup this group contains the MIB objects that need to be implemented to support the E line package.
pktcInternationalGroup this group contains optional MIB objects designed to support operations over the widest possible range of markets.

In any given system implementation for a particular country, it is anticipated that a small number of ring cadences will be in use.
Thus, this table most likely will not be populated to its full size."
"This is the Ring Cadence."
" The Tone Table defines the composition of tones and various tone operations.
The definition of the tones callWaiting1 through callWaiting4 in this table MUST only contain the audible tone itself; the delay between tones or the value of the tone repeat count are not applicable for the call waiting tones.
The delay between tones or the repeat count is controlled by the objects pktcSigEndPntConfigCallWaitingDelay and pktcSigEndPntConfigCallWaitingMaxRep.
If the pktcSigDevToneType is set to either of the values callWaiting1, callWaiting2, callWaiting3, or callWaiting4, then the value of the pktcSigDevToneWholeToneRepeatCount object indicates that the particular frequency group is applicable, as a repeatable part of the tone, based on the value of the MIB object pktcSigDevToneWholeToneRepeatCount.
The MTA MUST make sure that, after the provisioning cycle, the table is fully populated (i.e., for each possible index, an entry MUST be defined) using reasonable defaults for each row that was not defined by the provisioning information delivered via MTA Configuration.
The frequency composition of each tone is defined by the pktcSigDevMultiFreqToneTable.
For each tone type defined in pktcSigDevToneTable, the MTA MUST populate at least one entry in the pktcSigDevMultiFreqToneTable.
For each particular value of pktcSigDevToneType, the pktcSigDevToneTable table can define non repeating and repeating groups of the frequencies defined by the pktcSigDevMultiFreqToneTable, such that each group is represented by the set of the consecutive rows (frequency group) in the pktcSigDevMultiFreqToneTable.

This MIB object represents the Tone Sequence reference of a multi sequence tone."
"This MIB object represents the number of consecutive multi frequency tones for the particular tone type in the multi frequency table (pktcSigDevMultiFreqToneTable).
Such a sequence of the consecutive multi frequency tones forms the tone group for the particular tone type in the pktcSigDevToneTable."
"This is the repeat count, which signifies how many times to repeat the entire on off cadence sequence.
Setting this object may result in a cadence duration longer or shorter than the overall signal duration specified by the time out (TO) object for a particular signal.
If the repeat count results in a longer tone duration than the signal duration specified by the TO, the tone duration defined by the TO object for a particular signal always represents the overall signal duration for a tone.
In this case, the tone duration repeat count will not be fully exercised, and the desired tone duration will be truncated per the TO setting.
If the repeat count results in a shorter tone duration than the signal duration specified by the TO, the tone duration defined by the repeat count takes precedence over the TO and will end the signal event.
In this case, the TO represents a time not to be exceeded for the signal.
It is recommended to ensure proper telephony signaling so that the TO duration setting should always be longer than the desired repeat count time duration."
"This MIB object represents the steady tone status.
A value of 'true(1)' indicates that the steady tone is applied, and a value of 'false(2)' indicates otherwise.
Devices must play out the on off cadence sequence for the number of times indicated by the MIB object 'pktcSigDevToneWholeToneRepeatCount' prior to applying the last tone steadily, indefinitely.
If the MIB table 'pktcSigDevToneTable' contains multiple rows with this Object set to a value of 'true(1)', the steady tone is applied to the last repeating frequency group of the tone.
Setting this MIB object may result in a tone duration that is longer or shorter than the overall signal duration specified by the time out (TO)
MIB object for a particular signal.
If the repeat count results in a longer tone duration than the signal duration specified by the TO, the tone duration defined by the TO object for a particular signal always represents the overall signal duration for a tone.
In this case, the tone duration repeat count will not be fully exercised, and the desired tone duration will be truncated per the TO setting.
If the repeat count results in a shorter tone duration than the signal duration specified by the TO, the tone duration defined by the repeat count takes precedence over the TO and will end the signal event.
In this case, the TO represents a time not to be exceeded for the signal.
It is recommended to ensure proper telephony signaling that The TO duration setting should always be longer than the desired repeat count time duration, plus the desired maximum steady tone period."
This MIB table defines the characteristics of tones with multiple frequencies.
The constraints imposed on the tones by the MIB table

It is to be noted that while summation can be done without any constraint on the number of frequencies, the modulation (amplitude) holds good only when there are two frequencies (first and second).
Thus: If the mode is set to a value of 'firstModulatedBySecond(1)', the first frequency MUST be modulated by the second, and the remaining frequencies (third and fourth) ignored.

This section provides a couple of examples, specifically related to the MIB tables pktcSigDevToneTable and pktcSigDevMultiFreqToneTable.
Example A:  Call Waiting Tone Defined per [ITU T E.180]:

The single row of the pktcSigDevToneTable defines one multi frequency group of five rows (ToneFreqCounter) defined in the pktcSigDevMultiFreqToneTable and instructs the MTA to play this group only once (non repeatable as ToneRep Count equals 0).
Example B Congestion Tone congestion(17)
: Note: This example of an embedded cadence is based on an operator variation.
1) 400Hz on for 400ms
400Hz off for 350ms 3)

The first row of the pktcSigDevToneTable table instructs the MTA to play one row (ToneFreqCounter) of the pktcSigDevMultiFreqToneTable table only once (non repeatable as ToneRep Count equals 0).
The second row of the pktcSigDevToneTable table instructs the MTA to play the next two rows (ToneFreqCounter) of the pktcSigDevMultiFreqToneTable table and make this frequency group repeatable (ToneRep Count is not 0).
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
The following Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) and mask objects are used to differentiate between various types of traffic in the service provider network:
These objects may contain information that may be sensitive from a business perspective.
For example, they may represent a customer's service contract that a service provider chooses to apply to a customer's ingress or egress traffic.
If these objects are SET maliciously, it may permit unmarked or inappropriately marked signaling and media traffic to enter the service provider network, resulting in unauthorized levels of service for customers.
The following objects determine ring cadence, repeatable characteristics, signal duration, and caller id subscriber line protocol for telephony operation:
pktcSigDevR7Cadence pktcSigDevRgCadence pktcSigDevRsCadence pktcSigDevCidSigProtocol pktcSigDevVmwiSigProtocol pktcSigPulseSignalDuration
If these objects are SET maliciously, it may result in unwanted operation, or a failure to obtain telephony service from client (MTA) devices.
The objects in the pktcSigEndPntConfigTable are used for endpoint signaling.
The pktcSigEndPntConfigCallAgentId object contains the name of the call agent, which includes the call agent Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
If this object is SET maliciously, the MTA will not be able to communicate with the call agent, resulting in a disruption of telephony service.
The pktcSigEndPntConfigCallAgentUdpPort object identifies the UDP port for NCS traffic.
If this object is SET maliciously, the call agent will not receive NCS traffic from the MTA, also resulting in a disruption of telephony service.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
The most sensitive is pktcSigEndPntStatusCallIpAddress within pktcSigEndPntConfigTable.
This information itself may be valuable to would be attackers.
Other MIB Objects of similar sensitivity include pktcSigEndPntStatusError, which can provide useful information to MTA impersonators, and pktcSigDevCodecMax, which can provide useful information for planning Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on MTAs.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
