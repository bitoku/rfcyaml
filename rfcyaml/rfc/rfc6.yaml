  - "                        CONVERSATION WITH BOB KAHN\nI talked with Bob Kahn at\
    \ BB&N yesterday.  We talked about code conversion\nin the IMP's, IMP-HOST communication,\
    \ and HOST software.\nBB&N is prepared to convert 6, 7, 8, or 9 bit character\
    \ codes into 8-bit\nASCII for transmission and convert again upon assembly at\
    \ the destination\nIMP.  BB&N plans a one for one conversion scheme with tables\
    \ unique to the\nHOST.  I suggested that places with 6-bit codes may also want\
    \ case shifting.\nBob said this may result in overflow if too many case shifts\
    \ are necessary.\nI suggested that this is rare and we could probably live with\
    \ an overflow\nindication instead of a guarantee.\nWith respect to HOST-IMP communication,\
    \ we now have a five bit link field\nand a bit to indicate conversion.  Also possible\
    \ is a 2-bit conversion\nindicator, one for converting before sending and one\
    \ for converting after.\nThis would allow another handle for checking or controlling\
    \ the system.\nThe HOST can send messages or portions of a message to its IMP\
    \ specifying\n        1.  Tracing\n        2.  Conversion\n        3.  Whether\
    \ message is for destination IMP or HOST\n        4.  Send RFNM\n        5.  HOST\
    \ up or down\n        6.  Synchronization\n        7.  Format Error Messages\n\
    \        8.  Master Link Clear\n        9.  Status Requested\nThe IMP can send\
    \ to its HOST information on\n        1.  Conversion\n        2.  REFNM Arrived\n\
    \        3.  IMP up or down\n        4.  Synchornization\n        5.  Called HOST\
    \ not Responding\n        6.  Format Error\n        7.  Status in IMP\n"
