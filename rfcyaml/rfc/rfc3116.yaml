  - "1. Introduction\n   This document defines a specific set of tests that vendors\
    \ can use to\n   measure and report the performance characteristics of ATM network\n\
    \   devices.  The results of these tests will provide the user comparable\n  \
    \ data from different vendors with which to evaluate these devices.\n   The methods\
    \ defined in this memo are based on RFC 2544 \"Benchmarking\n   Methodology for\
    \ Network Interconnect Devices\".\n   The document \"Terminology for ATM Benchmarking\"\
    \ (RFC 2761), defines\n   many of the terms that are used in this document.  The\
    \ terminology\n   document should be consulted before attempting to make use of\
    \ this\n   document.\n   The BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking\n\
    \   Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents.  The\n   Terminology\
    \ documents present the benchmarks and other related terms.\n   The Methodology\
    \ documents define the procedures required to collect\n   the benchmarks cited\

- title: 2.1. Test Device Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1. Test Device Requirements\n   This document is based on the requirement that\
    \ a test device is\n   available.  The test device can either be off the shelf\
    \ or can be\n   easily built with current technologies.  The test device must\
    \ have a\n   transmitting and receiving port for the interface type under test.\n\
    \   The test device must be configured to transmit test PDUs and to\n   analyze\
    \ received PDUs.  The test device should be able to transmit\n   and analyze received\
    \ data at the same time.\n"
- title: 2.2. Systems Under Test (SUTs)
  contents:
  - "2.2. Systems Under Test (SUTs)\n   There are a number of tests described in this\
    \ document that do not\n   apply to each SUT.  Vendors should perform all of the\
    \ tests that can\n   be supported by a specific product type.  It will take some\
    \ time to\n   perform all of the recommended tests under all of the recommended\n\
    \   conditions.\n"
- title: 2.3. Test Result Evaluation
  contents:
  - "2.3. Test Result Evaluation\n   Performing all of the tests in this document\
    \ will result in a great\n   deal of data.  The applicability of this data to\
    \ the evaluation of a\n   particular SUT will depend on its expected use and the\
    \ configuration\n   of the network in which it will be used.  For example, the\
    \ time\n   required by a switch to provide ILMI services will not be a pertinent\n\
    \   measurement in a network that does not use the ILMI protocol, such as\n  \
    \ an ATM WAN.  Evaluating data relevant to a particular network\n   installation\
    \ may require considerable experience, which may not be\n   readily available.\
    \  Finally, test selection and evaluation of test\n   results must be done with\
    \ an understanding of generally accepted\n   testing practices regarding repeatability,\
    \ variance and the\n   statistical significance of a small numbers of trials.\n"
- title: 2.4. Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.4. Requirements\n   In this document, the words that are used to define the\
    \ significance\n   of each particular requirement are capitalized.  These words\
    \ are:\n   *  \"MUST\" This word, or the words \"REQUIRED\" and \"SHALL\" mean\
    \ that\n      the item is an absolute requirement of the specification.\n   *\
    \  \"SHOULD\" This word or the adjective \"RECOMMENDED\" means that there\n  \
    \    may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this\n    \
    \  item, but the full implications should be understood and the case\n      carefully\
    \ weighed before choosing a different course.\n   *  \"MAY\" This word or the\
    \ adjective \"OPTIONAL\" means that this item\n      is truly optional.  One vendor\
    \ may choose to include the item\n      because a particular marketplace requires\
    \ it or because it\n      enhances the product, for example; another vendor may\
    \ omit the\n      same item.\n   An implementation is not compliant if it fails\
    \ to satisfy one or more\n   of the MUST requirements for the protocols it implements.\
    \  An\n   implementation that satisfies all the MUST and all the SHOULD\n   requirements\
    \ for its protocols is said to be \"unconditionally\n   compliant\"; one that\
    \ satisfies all the MUST requirements but not all\n   the SHOULD requirements\
    \ for its protocols is said to be\n   \"conditionally compliant\".\n"
- title: 2.5. Test Configurations for SONET
  contents:
  - "2.5. Test Configurations for SONET\n   The test device can be connected to the\
    \ SUT in a variety of\n   configurations depending on the test point.  The following\n\
    \   configurations will be used for the tests described in this document.\n  \
    \ 1) Uni-directional connection: The test devices transmit port\n      (labeled\
    \ Tx) is connected to the SUT receive port (labeled Rx).\n      The SUTs transmit\
    \ port is connected to the test device receive\n      port (see Figure 1).  In\
    \ this configuration, the test device can\n      verify that all transmitted packets\
    \ are acknowledged correctly.\n      Note that this configuration does not verify\

    \ test and enough sizes in between to be able to get a full\n   characterization\
    \ of the SUT performance.  Except where noted, at\n   least five IP PDU sizes\
    \ SHOULD be tested for each test condition.\n   Theoretically the minimum size\
    \ UDP Echo request IP PDU would consist\n   of an IP header (minimum length 20\
    \ octets), a UDP header (8 octets),\n   AAL5 trailer (8 octets) and an LLC/SNAP\
    \ code point header (8 octets);\n   therefore, the minimum size PDU will fit into\
    \ one ATM cell.  The\n   theoretical maximum IP PDU size is determined by the\
    \ size of the\n   length field in the IP header.  In almost all cases the actual\n\
    \   maximum and minimum sizes are determined by the limitations of the\n   media.\
    \  In the case of ATM, the maximum IP PDU size SHOULD be the ATM\n   MTU size,\

    \   which are easy to understand and remember.  In addition, many of the\n   same\

    \ performance comparisons.\n   Note: The inclusion of an unrealistically small\
    \ IP PDU size on some\n   of the media types (i.e., with little or no space for\

    \ 1518, 2048, 4472, 9180\n   The minimum size IP PDU for UDP on ATM is 44 octets,\
    \ the minimum size\n   of 44 is recommended to allow direct comparison to token\
    \ ring\n   performance.  The IP PDU size of 4472 is recommended instead of the\n\
    \   theoretical FDDI maximum size of 4500 octets in order to permit the\n   same\
    \ type of comparison.  An IP (i.e., not UDP) IP PDU may be used in\n   addition\

    \ to each of the transmit\n   ports in sequence.  That is, all transmit ports\
    \ will receive an\n   identical distribution of IP PDUs from a particular receive\
    \ port.\n   Consider the following 6 port SUT:\n               --------------\n\

    \ benchmarking of a variety of device/media/service/protocol\n   combinations.\
    \  For example, a configuration for a LAN-to-WAN-to-LAN\n   test might be:\n \
    \     (1) ATM UNI -> SUT 1 -> BISUP -> SUT 2 -> ATM UNI\n   Or an extended LAN\
    \ configuration might be:\n      (2) ATM UNI -> SUT 1 -> PNNI Network -> SUT 2\
    \ -> ATM UNI\n   In both examples 1 and 2, end-to-end benchmarks of each system\
    \ could\n   be empirically ascertained.  Other behavior may be characterized\n\
    \   through the use of intermediate devices.  In example 2, the\n   configuration\
    \ may be used to give an indication of the effect of PNNI\n   routing on IP throughput.\n\
    \   Because multiple SUTs are treated as a single system, there are\n   limitations\
    \ to this methodology.  For instance, this methodology may\n   yield an aggregate\
    \ benchmark for a tested system.  That benchmark\n   alone, however, may not necessarily\
    \ reflect asymmetries in behavior\n   between the SUTs, latencies introduced by\
    \ other apparatus (e.g.,\n   CSUs/DSUs, switches), etc.\n   Further, care must\
    \ be used when comparing benchmarks of different\n   systems by ensuring that\
    \ the SUTs' features and configuration of the\n   tested systems have the appropriate\
    \ common denominators to allow\n   comparison.\n"

  - "2.20. Maximum IP PDU rate\n   The maximum IP PDU rates that should be used when\
    \ testing LAN\n   connections SHOULD be the listed theoretical maximum rate for\
    \ the IP\n   PDU size on the media.\n   The maximum IP PDU rate that should be\
    \ used when testing WAN\n   connections SHOULD be greater than the listed theoretical\
    \ maximum\n   rate for the IP PDU size on that speed connection.  The higher rate\n\
    \   for WAN tests is to compensate for the fact that some vendors employ\n   various\

  contents:
  - "2.21. Bursty traffic\n   It is convenient to measure the SUT performance under\
    \ steady state\n   load; however, this is an unrealistic way to gauge the functioning\
    \ of\n   a SUT.  Actual network traffic normally consists of bursts of IP\n  \
    \ PDUs.\n   Some of the tests described below SHOULD be performed with both\n\
    \   constant bit rate, bursty Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) Best Effort\n   [AF-TM4.1]\
    \ and Variable Bit Rate Non-real Time (VBR-nrt) Best Effort\n   [AF-TM4.1].  The\
    \ IP PDUs within a burst are transmitted with the\n   minimum legitimate inter-IP\
    \ PDU gap.\n   The objective of the test is to determine the minimum interval\n\
    \   between bursts that the SUT can process with no IP PDU loss.  Tests\n   SHOULD\
    \ be run with burst sizes of 10% of Maximum Burst Size (MBS),\n   20% of MBS,\
    \ 50% of MBS and 100% MBS.  Note that the number of IP PDUs\n   in each burst\
    \ will depend on the PDU size.  For UBR, the MBS refers\n   to the associated\
    \ VBR traffic parameters.\n"

    \ is a switch supporting PNNI, send the routing update to\n      the SUT receive\
    \ port and wait two seconds to be sure that the\n      routing has settled.\n\
    \   b) Send an ATM ARP PDU to determine the ATM address corresponding to\n   \
    \   the destination IP address.  The formats of the ATM ARP PDU that\n      should\
    \ be used are shown in the Test Frame Formats document and\n      MUST be in accordance\
    \ with RFC 2225.\n   c) Stimulate SUT with traffic load.\n   d) Wait for two seconds\
