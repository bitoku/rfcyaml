Abstract This document defines three RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
Extended Report (XR) blocks that allow the reporting of loss, duplication, and discard summary statistics metrics in a range of RTP applications.
This document defines three new block types to augment those defined in [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications:  Burst
/Gap Loss Summary Statistics Block
Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block  Frame Impairment Statistics Summary Block
The first two block types support the reporting of burst/gap loss and burst/gap discard summary statistics including packet loss/discard proportion, mean, and variance and belong to the class of transport  related end system metrics defined in [RFC6792].
These two blocks are intended to be used in conjunction with information from the Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block [RFC6958] or Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block [RFC7003], on which these two blocks therefore depend.
The metrics in the Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block and Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block are consistent with the definitions of "burst", "gap", "loss", and "discard" in RTCP XR [RFC3611].
The third block supports the reporting of detailed video statistics for each frame type, including the number of frames received, lost, and discarded of each frame type in the Group of Pictures (GOP) and additional data allowing the calculation of statistical parameters (e.g., the proportion of each frame type impaired by packet loss and discard).
The metrics defined in this block belong to the class of application level metrics defined in [RFC6792].
1.2.  RTCP and RTCP Extended Reports
The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].
[RFC3611] defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended Report (XR).
This document defines a new Extended Report block for use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].
The RTP Monitoring Framework [RFC6792] provides guidelines for reporting block format using RTCP XR.
Metrics described in this document are in accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6792].
Applicability These metrics are applicable to a wide range of RTP applications and reflect transient IP problems that affect user experience.
They can be used to form an accurate assessment of users' quality of experience and influence sender strategies to mitigate the problem.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
In addition, the following term is defined: Frame Type
In many cases, a video frame is compressed using different algorithms.
Frame type is used to identify different algorithms for video frames.
Two frame types used in the different video algorithms are the Key frame and Derived frames.
The Key frame is independently coded without prediction from other pictures and used as a reference frame for predicting other pictures.
Derived frames are predicatively coded and derived from a Key frame using a prediction algorithm.
If there is no video image compression, all frames are Key frames.
Transport Related End System Metrics 3.1.
/Gap Loss Summary Statistics Block
This block extends packet loss and discard metrics defined in Section 4.7.1 of [RFC3611].
The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement Information Block [RFC6776] (which MUST be present in the same RTCP packet as the Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block [RFC6958]) and also with the metric "cumulative number of packets lost" provided in standard RTCP [RFC3550].
Instances of this metrics block use the synchronization source (SSRC) to refer to the separate auxiliary Measurement Information Block [RFC6776], which describes measurement periods in use (see [RFC6776], Section 4.2).
This metrics block relies on the measurement period in the Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report and SHOULD be sent in the same compound RTCP packet as the Measurement Information Block.
If the measurement period is not received in the same compound RTCP packet as this metrics block, this metrics block MUST be discarded.
The metrics carried in this metrics block provide information relevant to statistical parameters, including Burst Loss Rate, Gap Loss Rate, Burst Duration Mean, and Burst Duration Variance, and are measured at the receiving end of the RTP stream using burst/gap loss metrics defined in [RFC6958] and other information that is sent together with this report block.
The structure of the Burst/Gap Loss Summary Statistics Block is as follows.
Definition of Fields in Loss Summary Statistics Block Block Type (BT): 8 bits A Burst/Gap Loss Summary Statistics Block is identified by the constant 17.
Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits This field is used to indicate whether the burst/gap loss summary statistics metrics are Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative metrics: I 10:
Interval Duration the reported value applies to the most recent measurement interval duration between successive metrics reports.
the reported value applies to the accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.
the reported value is a sampled instantaneous value.
In this document, the value I 00 is the reserved value and MUST NOT be used.
Reserved: 6 bits This field is reserved for future definition.
In the absence of such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and ignored by the receiver (see [RFC6709], Section 4.2).
The constant 3, in accordance with the definition of this field in Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].
SSRC of Source: 32 bits As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611
Burst Loss Rate: 16 bits
The fraction of packets lost during bursts since the beginning of reception, expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point immediately after the left most bit.
This value is calculated by dividing Packets Lost in Bursts by Total Packets Expected in Bursts, multiplying the result of the division by 32768 (0x8000), and keeping only the integer part.
The maximum value is thus 0x8000.
Representing this as a formula:
integer part( (Packets Lost in Bursts / Total Packets Expected in Bursts)   0x8000 )
If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.
Gap Loss Rate: 16 bits
The fraction of packets lost during gaps since the beginning of reception expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point immediately after the left most bit.
This value is calculated by dividing the difference between number of packets lost and Packets Lost in Bursts by the difference between Packets Expected and Total Packets Expected in Bursts, multiplying the result of the division by 32768 (0x8000), and keeping only the integer part.
The maximum value is thus 0x8000.
Representing this as a formula:
integer part ( (number of packets lost Packets Lost in Bursts)/
(Packets Expected Total Packets Expected in Bursts)   0x8000 ) where "number of packets lost" is obtained from standard RTCP [RFC3550] and Packets Expected is calculated as the difference between "extended last sequence number" and "extended first sequence number" (Interval or Cumulative) provided in the Measurement Identity and Information Block [RFC6776].
If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.
Note that if the metric is to be calculated on an Interval basis, a difference must be taken between the current and preceding values of "cumulative number of packets lost" in RTCP to obtain the "number of packets lost" for the reporting interval.
16 bits The mean burst duration is obtained as the quotient:
mean   Sum of Burst Durations / Number of Bursts where "Sum of Burst Durations" and "Number of Bursts" is obtained from the RTCP XR Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block [RFC6958].
If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.
Burst Duration Variance: 16 bits
(Number of Bursts 1) where "Sum of Squares of Burst Durations" and "Number of Bursts" is obtained from the RTCP XR Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block [RFC6958].
If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.
Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block
This block extends packet loss and discard metrics defined in Section 4.7.1 of [RFC3611].
The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement Identity Block [RFC6776] (which MUST be present in the same RTCP packet as the Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block).
These metrics provide information relevant to statistical parameters, including Burst Discard Rate and Gap Discard Rate, and are measured at the receiving end of the RTP stream using burst/gap discard metrics defined in [RFC7003] and other information that is sent together with this report block.
Instances of this metrics block use the synchronization source (SSRC) to refer to the separate auxiliary Measurement Information block [RFC6776] that describes measurement periods in use (see [RFC6776], Section 4.2).
This metrics block relies on the measurement period in the Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report and SHOULD be sent in the same compound RTCP packet as the measurement information block.
If the measurement period is not received in the same compound RTCP packet as this metrics block, this metrics block MUST be discarded.
The structure of the Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block is as follows.
Definition of Fields in Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block Block Type (BT): 8 bits
A Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block is identified by the constant 18.
Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits This field is used to indicate whether the burst/gap discard summary statistics metrics are Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative metrics: I 10:
Interval Duration the reported value applies to the most recent measurement interval duration between successive metrics reports.
the reported value applies to the accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.
the reported value is a sampled instantaneous value.
In this document, the value I 00 is the reserved value and MUST NOT be used.
Reserved: 6 bits This field is reserved for future definition.
In the absence of such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and ignored by the receiver (see [RFC6709], Section 4.2).
The constant 2, in accordance with the definition of this field in Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].
SSRC of Source: 32 bits As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC3611
Burst Discard Rate: 16 bits
The fraction of packets discarded during bursts since the beginning of reception, expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point immediately after the left most bit.
This value is calculated by dividing Packets Discarded in Bursts by Total Packets Expected in Bursts, multiplying the result of the division by 32768 (0x8000), and keeping only the integer part, according to the formula: integer part( (Packets Discarded in Bursts / Total Packets Expected in Bursts)   0x8000 )
If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.
Gap Discard Rate: 16 bits
The fraction of packets discarded during gaps since the beginning of reception expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point immediately after the left most bit.
This value is calculated by dividing the difference between number of packets discarded and Packets Discarded in Bursts by the difference between Packets Expected and Total Packets Expected in Bursts, multiplying the result of the division by 32768 (0x8000), and keeping only the integer part.
The maximum value is thus 0x8000.
Representing this as a formula: integer part( (number of packets discarded
Expected Total Packets Expected in Bursts)   0x8000 ) where "number of packets discarded" is obtained from the RTCP XR Discard Count Block [RFC7002] and filled with the sum of packets discarded due to early arrival (DT 1) and packets discarded due to late arrival (DT 2) and Packets Expected is calculated as the difference between "extended last sequence number" and "extended first sequence number" (Interval or Cumulative) provided in the Measurement Information Block [RFC6776].
In order for the Burst/ Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block to be meaningful, 2 instances of the Discard Count Block with DT 1 and DT 2 MUST be included in the same RTCP XR packet as the Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block.
If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.
Frame Impairment Statistics Summary Block
This block extends the statistics summary report mechanism defined in Section 4.6 of [RFC3611] and reports statistics on which frame types were affected beyond the information carried in the Statistics Summary Report Block RTCP packet specified in Section 4.6 of [RFC3611].
Information is measured at the receiving end of the RTP stream and recorded about the number of frames received, lost frames, duplicated frames, and lost partial frames.
Such information can be useful for network management and video quality monitoring.
The structure of the Frame Impairment Statistics Summary Block is as follows. 0
Definition of Fields in Frame Impairment Statistics Summary Block Block Type (BT): 8 bits A Frame Impairment Statistics Summary Block is identified by the constant 19.
Frame type indicator (T): 1 bit This field is used to indicate the frame type to be reported.
The bit is set to 0 if the full lost frames, partial lost frames, dup frames, and discarded frames fields contain Key frame (reference frame) counts or 1 if they contain Derived frame counts.
Note that if both the Key frame and Derivation frame report are sent, they should be sent in the same RTCP compound packet using two Frame Impairment Statistics Summary Blocks.
Reserved: 7 bits This field is reserved for future definition.
In the absence of such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and ignored by the receiver (see [RFC6709], Section 4.2).
The constant 6, in accordance with the definition of this field in Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

Number of duplicate frames (dup frames): 32 bits Number of duplicate frames received in the above sequence number interval.
Number of full lost frames (full lost frames): 32 bits
A frame is either split across multiple packets or carried in only one packet.
If the whole frame or all the packets of the frame are lost, this frame is regarded as one full lost frame.
The full lost frames can be inferred from packet(s) that comprise the frame.
The full lost frames is equivalent to the number of full lost frames in the above sequence number interval.
Number of partial lost frames (partial lost frames): 32 bits When a frame is split across multiple packets and
some packets of the frame are lost, this frame is regarded as one partial lost frame.
The partial lost frames can be inferred from packets that comprise the frame.
The value of the partial lost frames field is equivalent to the number of partial lost frames in the above sequence number interval.
SDP Signaling RFC 3611 defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
[RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.
However, XR blocks MAY be used without prior signaling (see Section 5 of [RFC3611]).
SDP rtcp xr Attribute Extension
This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp xr" defined in Section 5.1 of [RFC3611] by providing three additional values of "xr format" to signal the use of the report block defined in this document.
The ABNF [RFC5234] syntax is as follows.
/ xr bglss block / xr bgdss block / xr fiss block xr bglss block
"burst gap loss stat" xr bgdss block
"burst gap discard stat" xr fiss block
When SDP is used in offer/answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp xr" attribute parameters applies.
For detailed usage of Offer/Answer for unilateral parameter, refer to section 5.2 of [RFC3611].
IANA Considerations New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
For general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to RFC 3611.
