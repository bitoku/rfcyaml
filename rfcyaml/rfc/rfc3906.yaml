  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Link-state protocols like integrated Intermediate System\
    \ to\n   Intermediate System (IS-IS) [1] and OSPF [2] use Dijkstra's SPF\n   algorithm\
    \ to compute a shortest path tree to all nodes in the\n   network.  Routing tables\
    \ are derived from this shortest path tree.\n   The routing tables contain tuples\
    \ of destination and first-hop\n   information.  If a router does normal hop-by-hop\
    \ routing, the first-\n   hop will be a physical interface attached to the router.\
    \  New traffic\n   engineering algorithms calculate explicit routes to one or\
    \ more nodes\n   in the network.  At the router that originates explicit routes,\
    \ such\n   routes can be viewed as logical interfaces which supply Label\n   Switched\
    \ Paths through the network.  In the context of this document,\n   we refer to\
    \ these Label Switched Paths as Traffic Engineering tunnels\n   (TE-tunnels).\
    \  Such capabilities are specified in [3] and [4].\n   The existence of TE-tunnels\
    \ in the network and how the traffic in the\n   network is switched over those\
    \ tunnels are orthogonal issues.  A node\n   may define static routes pointing\
    \ to the TE-tunnels, it may match the\n   recursive route next-hop with the TE-tunnel\
    \ end-point address, or it\n   may define local policy such as affinity based\
    \ tunnel selection for\n   switching certain traffic.  This document describes\
    \ a mechanism\n   utilizing link-state IGPs to dynamically install IGP routes\
    \ over\n   those TE-tunnels.\n   The tunnels under consideration are tunnels created\
    \ explicitly by the\n   node performing the calculation, and with an end-point\
    \ address known\n   to this node.  For use in algorithms such as the one described\
    \ in\n   this document, it does not matter whether the tunnel itself is\n   strictly\
    \ or loosely routed.  A simple constraint can ensure that the\n   mechanism be\
    \ loop free.  When a router chooses to inject a packet\n   addressed to a destination\
    \ D, the router may inject the packet into a\n   tunnel where the end-point is\
    \ closer (according to link-state IGP\n   topology) to the destination D than\
    \ is the injecting router.  In\n   other words, the tail-end of the tunnel has\
    \ to be a downstream IGP\n   node for the destination D.  The algorithms that\
    \ follow are one way\n   that a router may obey this rule and dynamically make\
    \ intelligent\n   choices about when to use TE-tunnels for traffic.  This algorithm\
    \ may\n   be used in conjunction with other mechanisms such as statically\n  \
    \ defined routes over TE-tunnels or traffic flow and QoS based TE-\n   tunnel\
    \ selection.\n   This IGP shortcut mechanism assumes the TE-tunnels have already\
    \ been\n   setup.  The TE-tunnels in the network may be used for QoS, bandwidth,\n\
    \   redundancy, or fastreroute reasons.  When an IGP shortcut mechanism\n   is\
    \ applied on those tunnels, or other mechanisms are used in\n   conjunction with\
    \ an IGP shortcut, the physical traffic switching\n   through those tunnels may\
    \ not match the initial traffic engineering\n   setup goal.  Also the traffic\
    \ pattern in the network may change with\n   time.  Some forwarding plane measurement\
    \ and feedback into the\n   adjustment of TE-tunnel attributes need to be there\
    \ to ensure that\n   the network is being traffic engineered efficiently [6].\n"

  - "2.  Enhancement to the Shortest Path First Computation\n   During each step of\
    \ the SPF computation, a router discovers the path\n   to one node in the network.\
    \  If that node is directly connected to\n   the calculating router, the first-hop\
    \ information is derived from the\n   adjacency database.  If a node is not directly\
    \ connected to the\n   calculating router, it inherits the first-hop information\
    \ from the\n   parent(s) of that node.  Each node has one or more parents.  Each\n\
    \   node is the parent of zero or more down-stream nodes.\n   For traffic engineering\
    \ purposes, each router maintains a list of all\n   TE-tunnels that originate\
    \ at this router.  For each of those TE-\n   tunnels, the router at the tail-end\
    \ is known.\n   During SPF, when a router finds the path to a new node (in other\n\
    \   words, this new node is moved from the TENTative list to the PATHS\n   list),\
    \ the router must determine the first-hop information.  There\n   are three possible\
    \ ways to do this:\n      -  Examine the list of tail-end routers directly reachable\
    \ via a\n         TE-tunnel.  If there is a TE-tunnel to this node, we use the\n\
    \         TE-tunnel as the first-hop.\n      -  If there is no TE-tunnel, and\
    \ the node is directly connected,\n         we use the first-hop information from\
    \ the adjacency database.\n      -  If the node is not directly connected, and\
    \ is not directly\n         reachable via a TE-tunnel, we copy the first-hop information\n\
    \         from the parent node(s) to the new node.\n   The result of this algorithm\
    \ is that traffic to nodes that are the\n   tail-end of TE-tunnels, will flow\
    \ over those TE-tunnels.  Traffic to\n   nodes that are downstream of the tail-end\
    \ nodes will also flow over\n   those TE-tunnels.  If there are multiple TE-tunnels\
    \ to different\n   intermediate nodes on the path to destination node X, traffic\
    \ will\n   flow over the TE-tunnel whose tail-end node is closest to node X. \
    \ In\n   certain applications, there is a need to carry both the native\n   adjacency\
    \ and the TE-tunnel next-hop information for the TE-tunnel\n   tail-end and its\
    \ downstream nodes.  The head-end node may\n   conditionally switch the data traffic\
    \ onto TE-tunnels based on user\n   defined criteria or events; the head-end node\
    \ may also split flow of\n   traffic towards either types of the next-hops; the\
    \ head-end node may\n   install the routes with two different types of next-hops\
    \ into two\n   separate RIBs.  Multicast protocols running over physical links\
    \ may\n   have to perform RPF checks using the native adjacency next-hops\n  \
    \ rather than the TE-tunnel next-hops.\n"
- title: 3.  Special Cases and Exceptions
  contents:
  - "3.  Special Cases and Exceptions\n   The Shortest Path First algorithm will find\
    \ equal-cost parallel paths\n   to destinations.  The enhancement described in\
    \ this document does not\n   change this.  Traffic can be forwarded over one or\
    \ more native IP\n   paths, over one or more TE-tunnels, or over a combination\
    \ of native\n   IP paths and TE-tunnels.\n   A special situation occurs in the\
    \ following topology:\n      rtrA -- rtrB -- rtrC\n               |       |\n\
    \              rtrD -- rtrE\n   Assume all links have the same cost.  Assume a\
    \ TE-tunnel is set up\n   from rtrA to rtrD.  When the SPF calculation puts rtrC\
    \ on the\n   TENTative list, it will realize that rtrC is not directly connected,\n\
    \   and thus it will use the first-hop information from the parent, which\n  \
    \ is rtrB.  When the SPF calculation on rtrA moves rtrD from the\n   TENTative\
    \ list to the PATHS list, it realizes that rtrD is the tail-\n   end of a TE-tunnel.\
    \  Thus rtrA will install a route to rtrD via the\n   TE-tunnel, and not via rtrB.\n\
    \   When rtrA puts rtrE on the TENTative list, it realizes that rtrE is\n   not\
    \ directly connected, and that rtrE is not the tail-end of a TE-\n   tunnel. \
    \ Therefore, rtrA will copy the first-hop information from the\n   parents (rtrC\
    \ and rtrD) to the first-hop information of rtrE.\n   Traffic to rtrE will now\
    \ load-balance over the native IP path via\n   rtrA->rtrB->rtrC, and the TE-tunnel\
    \ rtrA->rtrD.\n   In the case where both parallel native IP paths and paths over\
    \ TE-\n   tunnels are available, implementations can allow the network\n   administrator\
    \ to force traffic to flow over only TE-tunnels (or only\n   over native IP paths)\
    \ or both to be used for load sharing.\n"
- title: 4.  Metric Adjustment of IP Routes over TE-tunnels
  contents:
  - "4.  Metric Adjustment of IP Routes over TE-tunnels\n   When an IGP route is installed\
    \ in the routing table with a TE-tunnel\n   as the next hop, an interesting question\
    \ is what should be the cost\n   or metric of this route?  The most obvious answer\
    \ is to assign a\n   metric that is the same as the IGP metric of the native IP\
    \ path as if\n   the TE-tunnels did not exist.  For example, rtrA can reach rtrC\
    \ over\n   a path with a cost of 20.  X is an IP prefix advertised by rtrC.  We\n\
    \   install the route to X in rtrA's routing table with a cost of 20.\n   When\
    \ a TE-tunnel from rtrA to rtrC comes up, by default the route is\n   still installed\
    \ with metric of 20, only the next-hop information for\n   X is changed.\n   While\
    \ this scheme works well, in some networks it might be useful to\n   change the\
    \ cost of the path over a TE-tunnel, to make the route over\n   the TE-tunnel\
    \ less or more preferred than other routes.\n   For instance, when equal cost\
    \ paths exist over a TE-tunnel and over a\n   native IP path, by adjusting the\
    \ cost of the path over the TE-tunnel,\n   we can force traffic to prefer the\
    \ path via the TE-tunnel, to prefer\n   the native IP path, or to load-balance\
    \ among them.  Another example\n   is when multiple TE-tunnels go to the same\
    \ or different destinations.\n   Adjusting TE-tunnel metrics can force the traffic\
    \ to prefer some TE-\n   tunnels over others regardless of underlining IGP cost\
    \ to those\n   destinations.\n   Setting a manual metric on a TE-tunnel does not\
    \ impact the SPF\n   algorithm itself.  It only affects the comparison of the\
    \ new route\n   with existing routes in the routing table.  Existing routes can\
    \ be\n   either IP routes to another router that advertises the same IP\n   prefix,\
    \ or it can be a path to the same router, but via a different\n   outgoing interface\
    \ or different TE-tunnel.  All routes to IP prefixes\n   advertised by the tail-end\
    \ router will be affected by the TE-tunnel\n   metric.  Also, the metrics of paths\
    \ to routers that are downstream of\n   the tail-end router will be influenced\
    \ by the manual TE-tunnel\n   metric.\n   This mechanism is loop free since the\
    \ TE-tunnels are source-routed\n   and the tunnel egress is a downstream node\
    \ to reach the computed\n   destinations.  The end result of TE-tunnel metric\
    \ adjustment is more\n   control over traffic loadsharing.  If there is only one\
    \ way to reach\n   a particular IP prefix through a single TE-tunnel, then no\
    \ matter\n   what metric is assigned, the traffic has only one path to go.\n \
    \  The routing table described in this section can be viewed as the\n   private\
    \ RIB for the IGP.  The metric is an important attribute to the\n   routes in\
    \ the routing table.  A path or paths with lower metric will\n   be selected over\
    \ other paths for the same route in the routing table.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Absolute and Relative Metrics
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Absolute and Relative Metrics\n   It is possible to represent the TE-tunnel\
    \ metric in two different\n   ways: an absolute (or fixed) metric or a relative\
    \ metric, which is\n   merely an adjustment of the dynamic IGP metric as calculated\
    \ by the\n   SPF computation.  When using an absolute metric on a TE-tunnel, the\n\
    \   cost of the IP routes in the routing table does not depend on the\n   topology\
    \ of the network.  Note that this fixed metric is not only\n   used to compute\
    \ the cost of IP routes advertised by the router that\n   is the tail-end of the\
    \ TE-tunnel, but also for all the routes that\n   are downstream of this tail-end\
    \ router.  For example, if we have TE-\n   tunnels to two core routers in a remote\
    \ POP, and one of them is\n   assigned with an absolute metric of 1, then all\
    \ the traffic going to\n   that POP will traverse this low-metric TE-tunnel.\n\
    \   By setting a relative metric, the cost of IP routes in the routing\n   table\
    \ is based on the IGP metric as calculated by the SPF\n   computation.  This relative\
    \ metric can be a positive or a negative\n   number.  Not configuring a metric\
    \ on a TE-tunnel is a special case of\n   the relative metric scheme.  No metric\
    \ is the same as a relative\n   metric of 0.  The relative metric is bounded by\
    \ minimum and maximum\n   allowed metric values while the positive metric disables\
    \ the TE-\n   tunnel in the SPF calculation.\n"
