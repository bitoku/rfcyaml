  - "                 Hosts Using the IMP Going Down Message\n    As given in BBN\
    \ Report 1822 (Specifications for the Interconnection\nof a Host and an IMP),\
    \ IMP to Host message type 2 specifies that the IMP\nlocal to the Host is going\
    \ down; the message further says when the IMP\nis going down, for how long, and\
    \ why.\n    When the IMP goes down after sending the IMP Going Down message to\n\
    the Host, the Host's network users and local users of the network will\nnot, in\
    \ general, be forewarned unless the Host sends a message to these\nusers.  We\
    \ therefore urge all Hosts to warn their network users and\nusers of the network\
    \ of impending IMP downs; just logging the received\nIMP Going Down message on\
    \ a logging teletype, as many Hosts currently\ndo, seems insufficient.\n    Incidentally,\
    \ please remember that Tuesday mornings from 7 a.m. to 9\na.m.  (Eastern Time)\
    \ are reserved for Network Software Maintenance, as\nannounced in RFC #440.\n\
    \       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into\
    \ the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with    ]\n       [ support from GTE,\
    \ formerly BBN Corp.            10/99 ]\n"
