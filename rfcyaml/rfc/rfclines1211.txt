1.  Introduction Maintaining large mailing lists, especially the processing of error reports, poses many problems.
Most of the examples come from the experience of managing the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) mailing list.
Many examples are presented in this memo.
Most of the specific problems shown have already been corrected.
Discussion At USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI)
we maintain mailing lists for the Internet Research Groups, the IETF, and other Internet groups; about 25 lists altogether.
We receive about 400 messages a month requesting additions or deletions to these lists.
There are about 20 messages a day requesting changes to the lists.
We also receive about 300 error messages a month due to mail delivery problems.
Many of these are duplicates, but the net result is that about 10 cases per day need to be investigated.
Many of the error reports are for "soft errors", primarily delayed delivery notices, such as "not delivered for 2 days, will try for 3 more days".
These just waste the list maintainer's time and are otherwise ignored.
This is especially wasteful when such messages are repeated every day.
However, if the same host is a cause of such messages for many days in a row, the list maintainer may investigate.
Please note that ignoring the soft errors is not always easy, since error messages often contain error reports on several mailboxes, requiring the error message to be read carefully to pick out the hard errors.
The error reports that indicate hard errors, such as "no such user" require the list maintainer to take action.
In many cases the appropriate action is to simply delete the user mailbox from the list.
However, if the mailbox in question is someone known to be active as a working group chair, or such, further investigation is necessary.
The more general case of "no such host" may be a temporary condition, but if it continues for several days it must be investigated.
Since the error conditions do not have standardized names (for example, "no such user" vs. "user unknown") it is sometimes difficult to understand whether a soft or hard error is being reported, and what one should do about it.
For example, what does "Can't Find Mail Center!
" mean, or what should one do about "mailll:%MAIL E OPENOUT, error opening SYS$USER2:[STGEORGE.LONGMAIL]MAIL$00040093BE236612.MAI; as outputI)"?
The first step in investigating a problem with a user mailbox is to see if it is on the list.
If so, the next step is to see if there really is a problem with it.
This is done by using the SMTP VRFY and EXPN features, Finger, or Whois.
This often develops information suggesting that the user has recently changed his address.
This has to be confirmed through an exchange of messages (with the postmaster) and then the mailing list must be updated.
If the user is not on the list, then it is likely the mail is sent via an exploder or sublist.
So the investigation focuses on finding which exploder may be involved, usually this is found by looking at the path (from the received lines) of the error report.
The exploder that is the source of the error can sometimes be checked using the SMTP EXPN feature.
Then the postmaster is notified.
If the error report is about a host being unknown, the programs "whathost", "dig", "ping", and "traceroute" may be used to find the problem.
However, getting the problem fixed may require communication with host and domain administrators.
What to do if problems can't be resolved: Delete the offending entry from the list that may eventually cause the following response: "I used to be on the ietf list, how come I am not getting the messages any more?"
In this section we discuss typical and frequent problems that occur with large mailing lists.
The most frequent problem is that error reports are sent to the author of the message rather than the list owner.
One way this can happen is when there is trouble with the author's host not connecting to another host along the route before it reaches ISI where the mailing list is.
At ISI the SMTP "from" information is added when the message is distributed to the list so that hosts following the SMTP protocol will send their error reports to the list owner.
However, not all hosts do this properly.
Another problem is that some machines do not pay attention to the SMTP information about where to send error reports.
It is a mailbox with an alias name that expands to a mailing list or group of recipients.
There are many sublists on our mailing lists.
When a user requests that a mailbox be added to a list that looks like an exploder, the following message is sent: We ask that all list maintainters of exploder mailboxes (an alias name that expands to a mailing list or group of recipients) set up some sort of ownership at their site, for their list.
What this means is, is any mailbox on your list is invalid, the error message will go to you (the list owner), and you can delete that mailbox from your list.
An example of an entry in your aliases file would be: owner ietf local:  stev@vax.ftp.com, (or your list maintainer/postmaster)
It appears that few people understand the concept of list ownership, or they do not set it up correctly.
There is ample evidence of problems in this area.
When investigating "user unknown" messages it is often the case that the user is not individually listed on our list.
The next step is to check received lines and hunt for an exploder list with a host similar to the one that the error came from or points to.
At that point we attempt to use SMTP EXPN or VRFY to check that the user is on a sublist.
Since many hosts do not implement EXPN or VRFY, the result of our check is inconclusive.
We then contact the list maintainer and ask him to delete the invalid mailbox if it is on his sublist.
Another problem occurs when someone on a sublist wants to change the name of his mailbox.
We look through the main list to make the correction and if that mailbox is not on the list we check the received lines and look for clues to determine which host this user may be on.
More than likely it is a sublist.
When the mailbox is in another protocol world (like UUCP or BITNET) there are often problems with the handling and direction of error reports.
Sometimes we are unable to find the addresses reported in the error message on the mailing list in question.
In such a case we check the mailing list for a host name also named in the received lines of a message in error.
If we find a match then we look for an exploder on that host and expand the sublist there to see if the mailbox in question is on that sublist.
At the time a sublist is entered into our list we record the name of the requestor and consider him the sublist owner.
As people change roles or companies this contact sometimes fails, in that case we fall back to contacting the postmaster.
However, not every site has a "postmaster" mailbox.
Most users send their requests and changes to the IETF Request mailbox, when they are on, in fact, a sublist, usually at their own company.
This creates a problem for us trying to determine which exploder they're on.
In this case, the request message is forwarded to the sublist owner so he can make changes to his list.
However, sometimes hosts may be somewhat similar in name (from the same organization, but in a different department, in a different building, off campus, etc.)
and it's hard to know if this person should really be on that particular sublist, or listed individually.
Occasionally, we examine the main file to see if there are individual addresses that could be incorporated in a sublist.
Some users don't know that mailing lists usually have a "request" mailbox, so they mistakenly send their requests to the main list.
When this happens, several people will resend the request to the list maintainer and then want to know if the request was completed.
3.4  Misdirected Messages There are also messages that go to the request mailbox when they are intended for the main list.
These messages get forwarded to the main list and a message is sent to the user notifying him of the correction and the proper way to address his message.
Summary Running a mailing list should be easy, and with small lists it is.
The number of changes and errors are small and infrequent.
But when lists get large and traffic gets heavy, the number of changes and errors grow to many a day.
The level of effort to manage a mailing list of substantial size and use becomes significant.
An additional problem is the creativity shown by mail program developers in inventing numerous different error reports.
We present a large sample of such messages in Appendix F.
We hope that these examples will be of help to other mailing list maintainers.
Our experience with maintaining large lists suggests the following:
Users:  Please be considerate and try to work problems out locally.
Please do everything you can to get the error messages related to your sublist to go to you.
Please try to get users on your system to talk to you about additions and deletions.

I readded you to the list.
In this example, the old mailbox "kent@ssbell.
COM" was to be deleted and the new mailbox "kent@sparky.
COM" was to be added.
However, when checking the mailing list the old address was not found.
Further checking for anything that resembled the hostname still did not turn up anything.
Then checking the full header information of the sender's message showed that the message came through UUNET.UU.NET.
There is a sublist on UUNET called "post ietf@UUNET.UU.NET".
By using the SMTP feature EXPN on the sublist the mailbox was found in the form "ssbell!kent".
Finally, a message was sent to the postmaster at UUNET and asked him to delete the mailbox.
Hello, I am currently receiving ietf related email at kent@ssbell.
I am moving to sparky.
COM as the ssbell system is going away.
Could you please change my address to kent@sparky.
COM so that I can stay on the list ?
Thu, 25 Oct 90 13:44:24 PDT From: Ann Westine <westine@venera.isi.edu
Hi, Please delete the mailbox ssbell!kent from the "post ietf" list.
I will add his new address "kent@sparky.
COM" directly to the ietf list.
Another problem comes up when a sublist happens to be located in another protocol world such as BITNET or UUCP and that mail is forwarded through a mail relay.
Experience shows that proper implementation of the list ownership concept is even less likely.
SIGNET is a host in the UUCP world receiving mail forwarded through the mail relay THINK.COM.

Hi, We have a mailbox on the ietf list that gets relayed through your host THINK.COM.
We will have to delete this mailbox if a connection cannot be corrected.
In this example, "GATORCORP" is not on the IETF list.
In checking the received lines there is a host called VITALINK.COM.
We have an exploder on our list at VITALINK called "ietf  interest@vitalink.com".
The program DIG shows that VITALINK.COM MXs to UUNET.UU.NET.
Since VITALINK is not directly on the Internet the EXPN and VRFY features of SMTP don't apply, the sublist on VITALINK can't be checked.
However, there are enough clues to make an educated guess that the mailboxes on the host GATORCORP are on the exploder sublist at VITALINK.
In this situation a message was sent to the Postmaster of VITALINK.COM to ask him to delete the invalid addresses from his sublist.

Hi, We have an exploder mailbox on the IETF list called "ietf interest@vitalink.com".
but I think the following addresses may be on that list.
Please look into this "host unknown" problem.
If these addresses need to be deleted, please do so.
Every host on the Internet that processes mail is required to have a "postmaster" mailbox to receive error reports and trouble inquiries.
In this case, the "postmaster" mailbox was not recognized.

Using that clue the mailing list was searched for that host name (SATURN).
It appears that there is something internally wrong with the sublist and this error should have gone to the postmaster or owner of the IETF@SATURN.ACC.COM list instead of the IETF owner.

Decnet mail is not store and  forward, so decwrl (as smtp to decnet gateway) sees the end system error.
Trying to be helpful, it sends it back to you.
My advice is to delete any addresses you have trouble with, if they are in the .enet.dec.com subdomain.

Hi Doug, If the Postmaster is "unknown" please delete him from your exploder list "ietf@osi3.ncsl.nist.gov".
I have been receiving error messages like this one for several days now.
If I don't hear from you, I will have to delete the above mailbox.

Host osi3 is down 550 Postmaster...
I think I have found out what is wrong.
For some reason (we can discuss this below)
your exploder is sending IETF mail to our exploder (ietf@osi3.ncsl.nist.gov) through the machine osi.ncsl.nist.gov.
Now due to a recent subnet reconfiguration and subsequent lack of update to our DNS servers, the DNS was returning an incorrect address for osi3.
Thus IETF mail would be sent to OSI, which would try to forward it to OSI3 (using the wrong address).
OSI would think that OSI3 was down and dump the message, trying to send a notice to Postmaster.
OSI doesn't have an aliase for Postmaster and thus the second error message that you saw.
These two problems have been fixed on OSI.
Now the question is what address you have in your distribution list that would cause this mail to go through OSI in the first place.
I guess you might have something like "ietf%osi3@osi.ncsl.nist.gov.
The other interesting point about your list is that we receive IETF mail to our exploder directly from venera.
Thus I suspect that there are two entries for OSI3 on your distribution list.
One that gets relayed through OSI and one that points directly to OSI3.
If this is the case  please deleted everything except the "ietf@osi3.ncsl.nist.gov." address.
If this is not the case or if there are other problems let me know.
Here are all the addresses I have on the IETF list under NIST.GOV.
ietf@OSI3.NCSL.NIST.GOV, mills@OSI.NCSL.NIST.GOV I'll deleted "mills@osi.ncsl.nist.gov".
Here are two others at NIST hunt@ENH.NIST.GOV, sting@CAM.NIST.GOV
By the way, on the following message, it looks like the Mailer Daemon message went from OSI.ncsl.nist.gov to enh.nist.gov to venera.isi.edu.

Host osi3 is down 550 Postmaster..
User unknown Deleting the mills@osi.ncsl.nist.gov entry should fix your problems.
Mills has a .forward to osi3, thus explaining why IETF mail was going   OSI   OSI3.
I checked OSI's sendmail.cf and it is relaying through enh.
This, though has nothing to do with the previous problem.
I flushed the queue of IETF mail on OSI waiting to go to OSI3.
I don't think you should see anymore bounced messages.
Sorry that our local problems were causing you grief

Hi Randy, I remember your request, and I also remember telling you that you are not on our list (at least individually).
There is an exploder "netadm@MATH.UFL.EDU" maintained at UFL.EDU.
You need to check with the postmaster to see if you are on their list.
If this is not the case, here are the only other addresses I have from UFL.EDU ceben@NERVM.NERDC.UFL.EDU, esj@UFL.EDU, FCLA@NERVM.NERDC.UFL.EDU, netadm@MATH.UFL.EDU, POKE@NERVM.NERDC.UFL.EDU
, There is another possibility, perhaps you have a pointer to a mailbox somewhere else?
re: done at last: please release me, let me go...
Many, many thanks for the reply
: I did not, somehow, see your previous reply
perhaps you forwarded it to someone at UFL.EDU instead of MATH.UFL.EDU?
Or I missed it in the flow of mail
I am trying to abate.
At any rate "netadm@math.ufl.edu" is indeed a local exploder, aliased at the moment to myself and one of my assistants.
It is local to the "math.ufl.edu" subdomain, and not to "ufl.edu" as your records indicate.
I am the postmaster of the "math.ufl.edu", and you should be able to verify "math.ufl.edu" has an MX record pointing to "mathlab.math.ufl.edu".
I am therefore mailing to you as root from that machine.
Please remove "netadm@math.ufl.edu" from your list.
I have quite enjoyed the discussions,  but the volume been overwhelming.
Thanks very much for your prompt reply, Appreciatively,  Randy Fischer <root@math.ufl.edu

The error message that you sent is unfortunately my mistake and has nothing to do with DECWRL.
One day I reset protection on all my files and directories and didn't realize that even the system did not have the privilege to write mail messages on my disk.
I discovered it only after several people sent phone messages to me.
Thanks for adding my name again.
I will try to be careful.
