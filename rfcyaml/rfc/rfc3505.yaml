- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   ECML Version 2.0 will describe the syntax of a class of data\
    \ objects\n   called Payment Processing Objects.  This will involve the development\n\
    \   of a hierarchically organized set of data elements and an XML syntax\n   for\
    \ payment transaction information for both electronic wallets and\n   Business\
    \ to Business (B2B) payment types such as credit card,\n   electronic check, line\
    \ of credit, ACH (Automated Clearing House,)\n   Mobile Phone Payments, and PDA\
    \ Payments.\n   This document lists the design principles, scope, and requirements\n\
    \   over three things: (1) the scope of work available to the WG, (2) the\n  \
    \ ECML version 2 specification, and (3) applications that implement the\n   specification.\
    \  It includes requirements as they relate to the\n   payment element syntax,\
    \ data model, format, implementation, and\n   external requirements.  Those things\
    \ that are required are designated\n   as \"must\", those things that are optional\
    \ are designated by \"may\",\n   those things that are optional but recommended\
    \ are designated as\n   \"should\".\n"
- title: 1.1 Relationship to Other Standards
  contents:
  - "1.1 Relationship to Other Standards\n   The set of fields documented herein was\
    \ started by the ECML Alliance\n   [ECML] which developed the North American /\
    \ HTML form field oriented\n   Versions 1 and 1.1 of ECML [RFC 3106].  Control\
    \ and development of\n   future versions of the standard has been transferred\
    \ to the IETF.\n   The ECML Version 1 fields were initially derived from and are\n\
    \   consistent with the W3C P3P base data schema [P3P BASE].  Version 2\n   extends\
    \ the fields provided to encompass [P3P ECOM] and selected\n   additional fields\
    \ from [ISO 8583], [JCM], or other sources.\n   ECML Version 2.0 is not a replacement\
    \ or alternative to TLS [RFC\n   2246], SET [SET], EMV [EMV], XML [XML], or IOTP\
    \ [RFC 2801].  These\n   are important standards that provide functionality such\
    \ as\n   confidentiality, non-repudiated transactions, automatic payment\n   scheme\
    \ selection, and smart card support.\n"
- title: 2. Design Principles and Scope
  contents:
  - "2. Design Principles and Scope\n   1. The specification must describe the fields\
    \ necessary to process a\n      payment between a consumer and merchant or between\
    \ two businesses,\n      describing the XML syntax and content in particular.\n\
    \   2. Keep the addition of fields beyond those in ECML v1.1 [RFC 3106]\n    \
    \  to a minimum.\n   3. Maintain all existing functionality from ECML v1.1.  In\
    \ essence,\n      ECML v2 should be a superset of ECML v1.1.\n   4. Increase the\
    \ flexibility of the standard to include other forms of\n      payments.  These\
    \ include ACH, Mobile Phone, PDA, Purchasing Card\n      and electronic check.\
    \  See [P3P ECOM, JCM], etc.\n   5. Allow for use of a common and uniform DTD\
    \ with back-end payment\n      systems such as Enterprise Resource Provision (ERP),\
    \ Card Line\n      Item Detail (LID) Level II & Level III, etc.\n   6. Allow for\
    \ use of the standard with Business to Business (B2B)\n      payment vehicles,\
    \ such as B2B Wallets, Marketplaces, etc.\n   7. Create a usage/implementation\
    \ guide section of the specification\n      to cover additional use cases for\
    \ functionality included.\n   8. ECML version 2 may include the concept of an\
    \ offer.\n   9. ECML version 2 should be developed as part of the broader Web\n\
    \      design philosophy of decentralization, URIs, Web data, modularity\n   \
    \   /layering / extensibility, and assertions as statements about\n      statements.\
    \  [Berners-Lee, WebData, XML, XML Name] In this\n      context, this standard\
    \ should take advantage of existing provider\n      (and infrastructure) primitives.\n"
- title: 3. Requirements
  contents:
  - "3. Requirements\n   ECML v2 must cover the data types and other requirements\
    \ enumerated\n   in this section.  It should provide for asserting and querying\n\
    \   relevant element values.\n"
- title: 3.1 Payment Processing Elements
  contents:
  - "3.1 Payment Processing Elements\n      1. Cost\n      2. Receipt\n      3. Currency\n\
    \      4. Card\n      5. Payment\n      6. Bank/Telco\n"
- title: 3.2 Payment Processing Types
  contents:
  - "3.2 Payment Processing Types\n      1. All current Processing types for ECML\
    \ 1.1 [RFC 3106].\n      2. Automated Clearing house [ACH]\n      3. Electronic\
    \ check [eCheck]\n      4. Mobile phone payments\n      5. PDA payments\n"
- title: 3.3 XML Data Model and Syntax
  contents:
  - "3.3 XML Data Model and Syntax\n   1. A well-formed DTD and possibly schema need\
    \ to be developed to\n      include new fields in this standard.\n   2. A W3C\
    \ Note may be drafted to document changes from [W3C ECOM].\n"
- title: 3.4 Implementation
  contents:
  - "3.4 Implementation\n   1. The ECML version 2 specification should meet the requirements\
    \ of\n      the following applications:\n      a. Internet Open Trading Protocol\
    \ v1.0 [IOTP]\n      b. Check against representative ACH, electronic check, and\
    \ Mobile\n         Phone payment setup.\n   2. Test all XML DTDs, schemas and\
    \ XML examples included the\n      specification to insure that they are well-formed\
    \ XML.\n   3. Compare completeness against (in accordance with standard's\n  \
    \    goals:)\n      1. ECML v1.1 [RFC 3106]\n      2. Using P3P for E-Commerce\
    \ [P3P NOTE]\n      3. Financial transaction card originated messages [ISO 8583]\n\
    \      4. ebXML\n"
- title: 3.5 Detailed Requests
  contents:
  - "3.5 Detailed Requests\n   The following are specific comments received on claimed\
    \ deficiencies\n   in ECML v1.1 and should all be considered for possible inclusion\
    \ in\n   ECML v2.\n   1. Increase Last Name field minimum required support to\
    \ at least 22\n      characters.\n   2. Improved Internationalization support.\n\
    \   3. Longer minimum supported telephone number and email fields.\n   4. Provide\
    \ a \"translation field\" which would specify a mapping\n      between existing\
    \ fields and ECML specified fields.  The addition\n      of such a field in ECML\
    \ v2 (which would normally be hidden when\n      presented in HTML) would permit\
    \ ECML support with no change to\n      existing fields or code.  ECML code could\
    \ fill in existing fields\n      based on the ECML field they map to.\n"
- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   Many ECML fields contain sensitive private information.\
    \  ECML is\n   dependent upon:\n   - the security of the transmission infrastructure\
    \ used to send such\n     private information\n   - the security of applications\
    \ which store or release such sensitive\n     information.\n   ECML need not add\
    \ any security mechanisms to this infrastructure or\n   these applications.  The\
    \ ECML v2 specification must include adequate\n   warnings and suggested courses\
    \ of action to protect this information.\n"
