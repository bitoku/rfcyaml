  - "Memorandum\n   There has been recent rapid progress in the specification and\n\
    \   implementation of computer protocols based on the International\n   Organization\
    \ for Standardization model for Open Systems\n   Interconnection (OSI).  The Government\
    \ OSI Profile (GOSIP), dated 22\n   April 1987, contains sufficient information\
    \ to specify adequately and\n   acquire interoperable vendor implementations of\
    \ OSI message handling\n   and file transfer capabilities.  Therefore, the policy\
    \ on\n   standardization of host-to-host protocols for data communications,\n\
    \   promulgated by USDR&E memo of 23 March 1982, is modified as follows.\n   The\
    \ OSI message handling and file transfer protocols, together with\n   their underlying\
    \ protocols as defined in GOSIP, are adopted as\n   experimental co-standards\
    \ to the DoD protocols which provide similar\n   services (MIL-STDs 1777, 1778,\
    \ 1780, and 1781).  These OSI protocols\n   may be specified in addition to, in\
    \ lieu of, or as an optional\n   alternative to DoD protocols, in cases where\
    \ the current DoD protocol\n   applicability statements apply.  They are designated\
    \ as experimental\n   because of the limited operational experience currently\
    \ available\n   with the OSI protocols and the limited operational, testing, and\n\
    \   security environment currently defined in GOSIP.  Services and\n   agencies\
    \ choosing to implement OSI protocols at this time should\n   carefully evaluate\
    \ these factors and be prepared to deal with the\n   complications which may accompany\
    \ the introduction of new technology.\n   It is intended to adopt the OSI protocols\
    \ as a full co-standard with\n   the DoD protocols when GOSIP is formally approved\
    \ as a Federal\n   Information Processing Standard.  Two years thereafter, the\
    \ OSI\n   protocols would become the sole mandatory interoperable protocol\n \
    \  suite; however, a capability for interoperation with DoD protocols\n   would\
    \ be provided for the expected life of systems supporting the DoD\n   protocols.\n\
    \   In order to extend the OSI protocol capabilities and provide\n   interoperability\
    \ between the DoD and OSI protocols as rapidly as\n   possible, the following\
    \ actions are requested:\n      a.  The Director, Defense Communications Agency,\
    \ as the DoD\n      Executive Agent for Data Communications Protocol Standards,\n\
    \      should:\n      * Publish by November 1987 the DoD-OSI Interoperability\
    \ and\n      Transition Plan.  The plan should provide for interoperation of\n\
    \      the DoD and OSI protocols at the application level.  A capability\n   \
    \   for experimental interoperability of DoD and OSI message handling\n      and\
    \ file transfer capabilities should be provided by March 1988,\n      and a limit\
    \ operational capability by January 1989.\n      * Join the Corporation for Open\
    \ Systems (COS) as the Department of\n      Defense representative.  COS is a\
    \ non-profit consortium formed to\n      deal with testing and other operational\
    \ issues relating to OSI\n      protocols. At the request of the Office of Management\
    \ and Budget,\n      the Services and other defense agencies should not join COS\n\
    \      directly, but may participate as the agents of DCA on appropriate\n   \
    \   COS committees.\n      * Coordinate Service and agency participation, in accordance\
    \ with\n      existing directives, in groups developing OSI standards,\n     \
    \ specifications and operating and management procedures.  These\n      groups\
    \ include the Government OSI User's Group, the National\n      Bureau of Standards\
    \ OSI Implementor's Workshop, the Corporation\n      for Open Systems, the Manufacturing\
    \ and Automation Protocol (MAP)\n      and Technical and Office Protocol (TOP)\
    \ user's groups, the\n      American National Standards Institute X3S3 and X3T5\
    \ committees,\n      and the NATO Tri-Service Group on Communications and Electronic\n\
    \      Equipment, Sub-Group 9 (Data Processing and Distribution).\n      b.  The\
    \ Director, National Security Agency should assure that the\n      efforts of\
    \ the ongoing Secure Data Network Systems program can be\n      used to provide\
    \ the security extensions defined as future work\n      items in GOSIP.\n    \
    \  c.  The Services and defense agencies should share the results and\n      experience\
    \ of early implementations under the experimental\n      coexistence policy by\
    \ actively participating in the groups\n      indicated above, under DCA coordination.\
    \  This experience should\n      be particularly valuable in assuring that military\
    \ requirements\n      can be satisfied by the developing OSI standards, specifications,\n\
    \      and procedures.\n   This guidance provides for the interim steps necessary\
    \ to continue\n   progress toward implementation of OSI standards.  As the technology\n\
    \   matures and DoD gains additional experience, the final implementation\n  \
    \ details will be provided in a DoD Directive.\n"
