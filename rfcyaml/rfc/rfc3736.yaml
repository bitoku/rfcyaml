  - "Abstract\n   Stateless Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol service for IPv6\n\
    \   (DHCPv6) is used by nodes to obtain configuration information, such\n   as\
    \ the addresses of DNS recursive name servers, that does not require\n   the maintenance\
    \ of any dynamic state for individual clients.  A node\n   that uses stateless\
    \ DHCP must have obtained its IPv6 addresses\n   through some other mechanism,\
    \ typically stateless address\n   autoconfiguration.  This document explains which\
    \ parts of RFC 3315\n   must be implemented in each of the different kinds of\
    \ DHCP agents so\n   that agent can support stateless DHCP.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Nodes that have obtained IPv6 addresses through some other\
    \ mechanism,\n   such as stateless address autoconfiguration [6] or manual\n \
    \  configuration, can use stateless DHCP to obtain other configuration\n   information\
    \ such as a list of DNS recursive name servers or SIP\n   servers.  A stateless\
    \ DHCP server provides only configuration\n   information to nodes and does not\
    \ perform any address assignment.\n   Such a server is called \"stateless\" because\
    \ it need not maintain any\n   dynamic state for individual clients.\n   While\
    \ the DHCP specification [1] defines more than 10 protocol\n   messages and 20\
    \ options, only a subset of those messages and options\n   are required for stateless\
    \ DHCP service.  This document explains\n   which messages and options defined\
    \ in RFC 3315 are required for\n   stateless DHCP service.  The intended use of\
    \ the document is to guide\n   the interoperable implementation of clients and\
    \ servers that use\n   stateless DHCP service.\n   The operation of relay agents\
    \ is the same for stateless and stateful\n   DHCP service.  The operation of relay\
    \ agents is described in the DHCP\n   specification.\n   Section 4 of this document\
    \ lists the sections of the DHCP document\n   that an implementor should read\
    \ for an overview of the DHCP\n   specification and the basic requirements of\
    \ a DHCP service.  Section\n   5 lists the specific messages and options that\
    \ are specifically\n   required for stateless DHCP service.  Section 6 describes\
    \ how\n   stateless and stateful DHCP servers interact to provide service to\n\
    \   clients that require address assignment and clients that require only\n  \
    \ stateless service.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   Throughout this document, \"DHCP\" refers to DHCP for IPv6.\n\
    \   This document uses the terminology defined in RFC 2460 [2], the DHCP\n   specification\
    \ [1], and the DHCP DNS configuration options\n   specification [3].\n   \"Stateless\
    \ DHCP\" refers to the use of DHCP to provide configuration\n   information to\
    \ clients that does not require the server to maintain\n   dynamic state about\
    \ the DHCP clients.\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   This document assumes that a node using stateless DHCP configuration\n\
    \   is not using DHCP for address assignment, and that a node has\n   determined\
    \ at least a link-local address as described in section 5.3\n   of RFC 2461 [4].\n\
    \   To obtain configuration parameters through stateless DHCP, a node\n   uses\
    \ the DHCP Information-request message.  DHCP servers respond to\n   the node's\
    \ message with a Reply message that carries configuration\n   parameters for the\
    \ node.  The Reply message from the server can carry\n   configuration information,\
    \ such as a list of DNS recursive name\n   servers [3] and SIP servers [5].\n\
    \   This document does not apply to the function of DHCP relay agents as\n   described\
    \ in RFC 3315.  A network element can provide both DHCP\n   server and DHCP relay\
    \ service.  For example, a network element can\n   provide stateless DHCP service\
    \ to hosts requesting stateless DHCP\n   service, while relaying messages from\
    \ hosts requesting address\n   assignment through DHCP to another DHCP server.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Basic Requirements for Implementation of DHCP\n   Several sections of the\
    \ DHCP specification provide background\n   information or define parts of the\
    \ specification that are common to\n   all implementations:\n   1-4:   give an\
    \ introduction to DHCP and an overview of DHCP message\n          flows\n   5:\
    \     defines constants used throughout the protocol specification\n   6, 7: \
    \ illustrate the format of DHCP messages\n   8:     describes the representation\
    \ of Domain Names\n   9:     defines the \"DHCP unique identifier\" (DUID)\n \
    \  13-16: describe DHCP message transmission, retransmission, and\n          validation\n\
    \   21:    describes authentication for DHCP\n"
- title: 5.  Implementation of Stateless DHCP
  contents:
  - "5.  Implementation of Stateless DHCP\n   The client indicates that it is requesting\
    \ configuration information\n   by sending an Information-request message that\
    \ includes an Option\n   Request option specifying the options that it wishes\
    \ to receive from\n   the DHCP server.  For example, if the client is attempting\
    \ to obtain\n   a list of DNS recursive name servers, it identifies the DNS Recursive\n\
    \   Name Server option in the Information-request message.  The server\n   determines\
    \ the appropriate configuration parameters for the client\n   based on its configuration\
    \ policies and responds with a Reply message\n   containing the requested parameters.\
    \  In this example, the server\n   would respond with DNS configuration parameters.\n\
    \   As described in section 18.1.5 of RFC 3315, a node may include a\n   Client\
    \ Identifier option in the Information-request message to\n   identify itself\
    \ to a server, because the server administrator may\n   want to customize the\
    \ server's response to each node, based on the\n   node's identity.\n   RFC 3315\
    \ does not define any mechanisms through which the time at\n   which a host uses\
    \ an Information-request message to obtain updated\n   configuration parameters\
    \ can be controlled.  The DHC WG has\n   undertaken the development of such a\
    \ mechanism or mechanisms which\n   will be published as Standards-track RFC(s).\n\
    \   RFC 3315 also does not provide any guidance about when a host might\n   use\
    \ an Information-request message to obtain updated configuration\n   parameters\
    \ when the host has moved to a new link.  The DHC WG is\n   reviewing a related\
    \ document, \"Detection of Network Attachment (DNA)\n   in IPv4\" [8], which describes\
    \ how a host using IPv4 can determine\n   when to use DHCPv4.  Either the DHC\
    \ WG or a WG formed from the DNA\n   BOF will undertake development of a similar\
    \ document for IPv6.\n"

- title: 6.  Interaction with DHCP for Address Assignment
  contents:
  - "6.  Interaction with DHCP for Address Assignment\n   In some networks, there\
    \ may be both clients that are using stateless\n   address autoconfiguration and\
    \ DHCP for DNS configuration and clients\n   that are using DHCP for stateful\
    \ address configuration.  Depending on\n   the deployment and configuration of\

    \ may receive messages\n   from clients that are performing stateful address configuration.\n\
    \   A DHCP server that is only able to provide stateless configuration\n   information\
    \ through an Information-request/Reply message exchange\n   discards any other\
    \ DHCP messages it receives.  Specifically, the\n   server discards any messages\
    \ other than Information-Request or\n   Relay-forward it receives, and the server\
    \ does not participate in any\n   stateful address configuration message exchanges.\
    \  If there are other\n   DHCP servers that are configured to provide stateful\
    \ address\n   assignment, one of those servers will provide the address assignment.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Stateless DHCP service is a proper subset of\
    \ the DHCP service\n   described in the DHCP specification, RFC 3315 [1].  Therefore,\n\
    \   stateless DHCP service introduces no additional security\n   considerations\
    \ beyond those discussed in sections 21, 22.11, and 23\n   of the DHCP specification\
    \ [1].\n   Configuration information provided to a node through stateless DHCP\n\
    \   service may be used to mount spoofing, man-in-the-middle, denial-of-\n   service,\
    \ and other attacks.  These attacks are described in more\n   detail in the specifications\
    \ for each of the options that carry\n   configuration information.  Authenticated\
    \ DHCP, as described in\n   sections 21 and 22.11 of the DHCP specification [1],\
    \ can be used to\n   avoid attacks mounted through the stateless DHCP service.\n"
