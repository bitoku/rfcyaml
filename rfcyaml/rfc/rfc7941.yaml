  - "Abstract\n   Source Description (SDES) items are normally transported in the
    RTP\n   Control Protocol (RTCP).  In some cases, it can be beneficial to\n   speed
    up the delivery of these items.  The main case is when a new\n   synchronization
    source (SSRC) joins an RTP session and the receivers\n   need this source's identity,
    relation to other sources, or its\n   synchronization context, all of which may
    be fully or partially\n   identified using SDES items.  To enable this optimization,
    this\n   document specifies a new RTP header extension that can carry SDES\n   items.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification defines an RTP header extension [RFC3550][RFC5285]\n
    \  that can carry RTCP Source Description (SDES) items.  Normally, the\n   SDES
    items are carried in their own RTCP packet type [RFC3550].  By\n   including selected
    SDES items in a header extension, the\n   determination of relationship and synchronization
    context for new RTP\n   streams (SSRCs) in an RTP session can be optimized.  Which\n
    \  relationship and what information depends on the SDES items carried.\n   This
    becomes a complement to using only RTCP for SDES item delivery.\n   It is important
    to note that not all SDES items are appropriate to\n   transmit using RTP header
    extensions.  Some SDES items perform\n   binding or identify synchronization contexts
    with strict timeliness\n   requirements, while many other SDES items do not have
    such\n   requirements.  In addition, security and privacy concerns for the\n   SDES
    item information need to be considered.  For example, the Name\n   and Location
    SDES items are highly sensitive from a privacy\n   perspective and should not
    be transported over the network without\n   strong security.  No use case has
    identified that such information is\n   required when the first RTP packets arrive.
    \ A delay of a few seconds\n   before such information is available to the receiver
    appears\n   acceptable.  Therefore, only appropriate SDES items, such as CNAME,\n
    \  will be registered for use with this header extension.\n   Requirements language
    and terminology are defined in Section 2.\n   Section 3 describes why this header
    extension is sometimes required\n   or at least provides a significant improvement
    compared to waiting\n   for regular RTCP packet transmissions of the information.
    \ Section 4\n   provides a specification of the header extension and usage\n   recommendations.
    \ Section 5 defines a subspace of the header\n   extension URN to be used for
    existing and future SDES items and\n   registers the appropriate existing SDES
    items.\n"

  - "3.  Motivation\n   SDES items are associated with a particular SSRC and thus
    with a\n   particular RTP stream.  The Source Description items provide various\n
    \  metadata associated with the SSRC.  How important it is to have this\n   data
    no later than when the first RTP packets is received depends on\n   the item itself.
    \ The CNAME item is one item that is commonly needed\n   either at reception of
    the first RTP packet for this SSRC or at least\n   by the time the first media
    can be played out.  If it is not\n   available, the synchronization context cannot
    be determined; thus,\n   any related streams cannot be correctly synchronized.
    \ Therefore,\n   this is a valuable example for having this information early
    when a\n   new RTP stream is received.\n   The main reason for new SSRCs in an
    RTP session is when media sources\n   are added.  This can be because either an
    endpoint is adding a new\n   actual media source or additional participants in
    a multi-party\n   session are added to the session.  Another reason for a new
    SSRC can\n   be an SSRC collision that forces both colliding parties to select
    new\n   SSRCs.\n   For the case of rapid media synchronization, one may use the
    RTP\n   header extension for rapid synchronization of RTP flows [RFC6051].\n   This
    header extension carries the clock information present in the\n   RTCP sender
    report (SR) packets.  However, it assumes that the CNAME\n   binding is known,
    which can be provided via signaling [RFC5576] in\n   some cases, but not all.
    \ Thus, an RTP header extension for carrying\n   SDES items like CNAME is a powerful
    combination to enable rapid\n   synchronization in all cases.\n   The \"Rapid
    Synchronisation of RTP Flows\" specification [RFC6051] does\n   provide an analysis
    of the initial synchronization delay for\n   different sessions depending on the
    number of receivers as well as on\n   session bandwidth (Section 2.1 of [RFC6051]).
    \ These results are also\n   applicable for other SDES items that have a similar
    time dependency\n   until the information can be sent using RTCP.  These figures
    can be\n   used to determine the benefit of reducing the initial delay before\n
    \  information is available for some use cases.\n   [RFC6051] also discusses the
    case of late joiners and defines an RTCP\n   Feedback format to request synchronization
    information, which is\n   another potential use case for SDES items in the RTP
    header\n   extension.  It would, for example, be natural to include a CNAME SDES\n
    \  item with the header extension containing the NTP-formatted reference\n   clock
    to ensure synchronization.\n   The ongoing work on bundling Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) media\n   descriptions [SDP-BUNDLE] has identified a new SDES item
    that can\n   benefit from timely delivery.  A corresponding RTP SDES compact\n
    \  header extension is therefore also defined and registered in that\n   document:\n
    \  MID:  This is a media description identifier that matches the value\n      of
    the SDP [RFC4566] a=mid attribute [RFC5888], to associate RTP\n      streams multiplexed
    on the same transport with their respective\n      SDP media description.\n"

      headers.  The\n   short headers (one byte) are restricted to 1 to 16 bytes of
      data,\n   while the long format (two bytes) supports a data length of 0 to 255\n
      \  bytes.  Thus, the RTP header extension formats are capable of\n   supporting
      any SDES item from a data length perspective.\n   The ID field, independent
      of a short or long format, identifies both\n   the type of RTP header extension
      and, in the case of the SDES item\n   header extension, the type of SDES item.

      expansion, and when to send\n   SDES items in the header extension.\n"
    - contents:
      - "4.2.1.  One-Byte or Two-Byte Headers\n   The RTP header extensions for SDES
        items MAY use either the one-byte\n   or two-byte header formats, depending
        on the text value size for the\n   used SDES items and the requirement from
        any other header extensions\n   used.  The one-byte header SHOULD be used
        when all non-SDES item\n   header extensions support the one-byte format and
        all SDES item text\n   values contain at most 16 bytes.  Note that the RTP
        header extension\n   specification [RFC5285] does not allow mixing one-byte
        and two-byte\n   headers for the same RTP stream (SSRC), so if any SDES item
        requires\n   the two-byte header, then all other header extensions MUST also
        use\n   the two-byte header format.\n   For example, if using CNAMEs that
        are generated according to\n   \"Guidelines for Choosing RTP Control Protocol
        (RTCP) Canonical Names\n   (CNAMEs)\" [RFC7022], if using short-term persistent
        values, and if\n   96-bit random values prior to base64 encoding are sufficient,
        then\n   they will fit into the one-byte header format.\n   An RTP middlebox
        needs to take care choosing between one-byte headers\n   and two-byte headers
        when creating the first packets for an outgoing\n   stream (SSRC) with header
        extensions.  First of all, it needs to\n   consider all the header extensions
        that may potentially be used.\n   Second, it needs to know the size of the
        SDES items that are going to\n   be included and use two-byte headers if any
        are longer than 16 bytes.\n   An RTP middlebox that forwards a stream, i.e.,
        not mixing it or\n   combining it with other streams, may be able to base
        its choice on\n   the header size in incoming streams.  This is assuming that
        the\n   middlebox does not modify the stream or add additional header\n   extensions
        to the stream it sends, in which case it needs to make its\n   own decision.\n"

      - "4.2.2.  MTU and Packet Expansion\n   The RTP packet size will clearly increase
        when a header extension is\n   included.  How much depends on the type of
        header extensions and\n   their data content.  The SDES items can vary in
        size.  There are also\n   some use cases that require transmitting multiple
        SDES items in the\n   same packet to ensure that all relevant data reaches
        the receiver.\n   An example of that is when CNAME, a MID, and the rapid time\n
        \  synchronization extension from RFC 6051 are all needed.  Such a\n   combination
        is quite likely to result in at least 16+3+8 bytes of\n   data plus the headers,
        which will be another 7 bytes for one-byte\n   headers, plus two bytes of
        header padding to make the complete header\n   extension 32-bit word aligned,
        thus 36 bytes in total.\n   If the packet expansion cannot be taken into account
        when producing\n   the RTP payload, it can cause an issue.  An RTP payload
        that is\n   created to meet a particular IP-level Maximum Transmission Unit\n
        \  (MTU), taking the addition of IP/UDP/RTP headers but not RTP header\n   extensions
        into account, could exceed the MTU when the header\n   extensions are present,
        thus resulting in IP fragmentation.  IP\n   fragmentation is known to negatively
        impact the loss rate due to\n   middleboxes unwilling or not capable of dealing
        with IP fragments, as\n   well as increasing the target surface for other
        types of packet\n   losses.\n   As this is a real issue, the media encoder
        and payload packetizer\n   should be flexible and be capable of handling dynamically
        varying\n   payload size restrictions to counter the packet expansion caused
        by\n   header extensions.  If that is not possible, some reasonable worst-\n
        \  case packet expansion should be calculated and used to reduce the RTP\n
        \  payload size of all RTP packets the sender transmits.\n"
      title: 4.2.2.  MTU and Packet Expansion
    - contents:
      - "4.2.3.  Transmission Considerations\n   The general recommendation is to
        only send header extensions when\n   needed.  This is especially true for
        SDES items that can be sent in\n   periodic repetitions of RTCP throughout
        the whole session.  Thus, the\n   different usages (Section 4.2.4) have different
        recommendations.  The\n   following are some general considerations for getting
        the header\n   extensions delivered to the receiver:\n   1.  The probability
        for packet loss and burst loss determine how many\n       repetitions of the
        header extensions will be required to reach a\n       targeted delivery probability
        and, if burst loss is likely, what\n       distribution would be needed to
        avoid getting all repetitions of\n       the header extensions lost in a single
        burst.\n   2.  If a set of packets are all needed to enable decoding, there
        is\n       commonly no reason for including the header extension in all of\n
        \      these packets, as they share fate.  Instead, at most one instance\n
        \      of the header extension per independently decodable set of media\n
        \      data would be a more efficient use of the bandwidth.\n   3.  How early
        the SDES item information is needed, from the first\n       received RTP data
        or only after some set of packets are received,\n       can guide if the header
        extension(s) should be in all of the\n       first N packets or be included
        only once per set of packets, for\n       example, once per video frame.\n
        \  4.  The use of RTP-level robustness mechanisms, such as RTP\n       retransmission
        [RFC4588] or forward error correction [RFC5109],\n       may treat packets
        differently from a robustness perspective, and\n       SDES header extensions
        should be added to packets that get a\n       treatment corresponding to the
        relative importance of receiving\n       the information.\n   As a summary,
        the number of header extension transmissions should be\n   tailored to a desired
        probability of delivery, taking the receiver\n   population size into account.
        \ For the very basic case, N repetitions\n   of the header extensions should
        be sufficient but may not be optimal.\n   N is selected so that the header
        extension target delivery\n   probability reaches 1-P^N, where P is the probability
        of packet loss.\n   For point-to-point or small receiver populations, it might
        also be\n   possible to use feedback, such as RTCP, to determine when the\n
        \  information in the header extensions has reached all receivers and to\n
        \  stop further repetitions.  Feedback that can be used includes the\n   RTCP
        Extended Report (XR) Loss RLE Report Block [RFC3611], which\n   indicates
        successful delivery of particular packets.  If the RTP/AVPF\n   transport-layer
        feedback message for generic NACK [RFC4585] is used,\n   it can indicate the
        failure to deliver an RTP packet with the header\n   extension, thus indicating
        the need for further repetitions.  The\n   normal RTCP report blocks can also
        provide an indicator of successful\n   delivery, if no losses are indicated
        for a reporting interval\n   covering the RTP packets with the header extension.
        \ Note that loss\n   of an RTCP packet reporting on an interval where RTP
        header extension\n   packets were sent does not necessarily mean that the
        RTP header\n   extension packets themselves were lost.\n"

          completely new for\n   everyone, the goal is to ensure, with high probability,
          that all RTP\n   session participants receive the information in the header
          extension.\n   Thus, header extension transmission strategies that allow
          some\n   margins in the delivery probability should be considered.\n"

        - "4.2.4.2.  Late Joiner\n   In a multi-party RTP session where one or a small
          number of receivers\n   join a session where the majority of receivers already
          have all\n   necessary information, the use of header extensions to deliver\n
          \  relevant information should be tailored to reach the new receivers.\n
          \  The trigger to send header extensions can, for example, be either\n   RTCP
          from a new receiver(s) or an explicit request like the Rapid\n   Resynchronization
          Request defined in [RFC6051].  In centralized\n   topologies where an RTP
          middlebox is present, it can be responsible\n   for transmitting the known
          information, possibly stored, to the new\n   session participant only and
          not repeat it to all the session\n   participants.\n"

          with the RTP data, and the\n   SDES information needs to be updated, then
          the use of the RTP header\n   extension is superior to RTCP.  Using the
          RTP header extension\n   ensures that the information is updated on reception
          of the related\n   RTP media, ensuring synchronization between the two.
          \ Continued use\n   of the old SDES information can lead to undesired effects
          in the\n   application.  Thus, header extension transmission strategies
          with\n   high probability of delivery should be chosen.\n"

      - "4.2.5.  SDES Items in RTCP\n   The RTP header extension information, i.e.,
        SDES items, can and will\n   be sent also in RTCP.  Therefore, it is worth
        making some reflections\n   on this interaction.  As an alternative to the
        header extension, it\n   is possible to schedule a non-regular RTCP packet
        transmission\n   containing important SDES items, if one uses an RTP-/AVPF-based
        RTP\n   profile.  Depending on the mode in which one's RTCP feedback\n   transmitter
        is working, extra RTCP packets may be sent as immediate\n   or early packets,
        enabling more timely SDES information delivery.\n   There are, however, two
        aspects that differ between using RTP header\n   extensions and any non-regular
        transmission of RTCP packets.  First,\n   as the RTCP packet is a separate
        packet, there is no direct relation\n   and also no fate sharing between the
        relevant media data and the SDES\n   information.  The order of arrival for
        the packets will matter.  With\n   a header extension, the SDES items can
        be ensured to arrive if the\n   media data to play out arrives.  Second, it
        is difficult to determine\n   if an RTCP packet is actually delivered, as
        the RTCP packets lack\n   both a sequence number and a mechanism providing
        feedback on the RTCP\n   packets themselves.\n"

    - contents:
      - "4.2.6.  Update Flaps\n   The SDES item may arrive both in RTCP and in RTP
        header extensions,\n   potentially causing the value to flap back and forth
        at the time of\n   updating.  There are at least two reasons for these flaps.
        \ The first\n   one is packet reordering, where a pre-update RTP or RTCP packet
        with\n   an SDES item is delivered to the receiver after the first RTP/RTCP\n
        \  packet with the updated value.  The second reason is the different\n   code
        paths for RTP and RTCP in implementations.  An update to the\n   sender's
        SDES item parameter can take a different time to propagate\n   to the receiver
        than the corresponding media data.  For example, an\n   RTCP packet with the
        SDES item included that may have been generated\n   prior to the update can
        still reside in a buffer and be sent\n   unmodified.  The update of the item's
        value can, at the same time,\n   cause RTP packets to be sent including the
        header extension, prior to\n   the RTCP packet being sent.\n   However, most
        of these issues can be avoided by the receiver\n   performing some checks
        before updating the receiver's stored value.\n   To handle flaps caused by
        reordering, SDES items received in RTP\n   packets with the same or a lower
        extended sequence number than the\n   last change MUST NOT be applied, i.e.,
        discard items that can be\n   determined to be older than the current one.
        \ For compound RTCP\n   packets, which will contain an SR packet (assuming
        an active RTP\n   sender), the receiver can use the RTCP SR timestamp field
        to\n   determine at what approximate time it was transmitted.  If the\n   timestamp
        is earlier than the last received RTP packet with a header\n   extension carrying
        an SDES item, and especially if carrying a\n   previously used value, the
        SDES item in the RTCP SDES packet can be\n   ignored.  Note that media processing
        and transmission pacing can\n   easily cause the RTP header timestamp field
        as well as the RTCP SR\n   timestamp field to not match with the actual transmission
        time.\n"

        compression\n   performance.  The extension indicator (X) bit in the RTP header
        is,\n   however, compressed.  It is classified as rarely changing, which may\n

  title: 5.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Source Description items may contain data that
    are sensitive from a\n   security perspective.  There are SDES items that are
    or may be\n   sensitive from a user privacy perspective, like CNAME, NAME, EMAIL,\n
    \  PHONE, LOC, and H323-CADDR.  Some may contain sensitive information,\n   like
    NOTE and PRIV, while others may be sensitive from profiling\n   implementations
    for vulnerability or other reasons, like TOOL.  The\n   CNAME sensitivity can
    vary depending on how it is generated and what\n   persistence it has.  A short-term
    CNAME identifier generated using a\n   random number generator [RFC7022] may have
    minimal security\n   implications, while a CNAME of the form user@host has privacy\n
    \  concerns, and a CNAME generated from a Media Access Control (MAC)\n   address
    has long-term tracking potentials.\n   In RTP sessions where any type of confidentiality
    protection is\n   enabled for RTCP, the SDES item header extensions MUST also
    be\n   protected.  This implies that to provide confidentiality, users of\n   the
    Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) need to implement and\n   use encrypted
    header extensions per [RFC6904].  SDES items carried as\n   RTP header extensions
    MUST then use commensurate strength algorithms\n   and SHOULD use the same cryptographic
    primitives (algorithms, modes)\n   as applied to RTCP packets carrying corresponding
    SDES items.  If the\n   security level is chosen to be different for an SDES item
    in RTCP and\n   an RTP header extension, it is important to justify the exception
    and\n   to consider the security properties as the worst in each aspect for\n
    \  the different configurations.  It is worth noting that the current\n   SRTP
    [RFC3711] only provides protection for the next trusted RTP/RTCP\n   hop, which
    is not necessarily end to end.\n   The general RTP header extension mechanism
    [RFC5285] does not itself\n   contain any functionality that is a significant
    risk for a\n   denial-of-service attack, neither from processing nor from storage\n
    \  requirements.  The extension for SDES items defined in this document\n   can
    potentially be a risk.  The risk depends on the received SDES\n   item and its
    content.  If the SDES item causes the receiver to\n   perform a large amount of
    processing, create significant storage\n   structures, or emit network traffic,
    such a risk does exist.  The\n   CNAME SDES item in the RTP header extension is
    only a minor risk, as\n   reception of a CNAME item will create an association
    between the\n   stream carrying the SDES item and other RTP streams with the same\n
    \  SDES item.  This usually results in time synchronizing the media\n   streams;
    thus, some additional processing is performed.  However, the\n   application's
    media quality is likely more affected by an erroneous\n   or changing association
    and media synchronization than the\n   application quality impact caused by the
    additional processing.\n   As the SDES items are used by the RTP-based application
    to establish\n   relationships between RTP streams or between an RTP stream and\n
    \  information about the originating participant, there SHOULD be strong\n   integrity
    protection and source authentication of the header\n   extensions.  If not, an
    attacker can modify the SDES item value to\n   create erroneous relationship bindings
    in the receiving application.\n   For information regarding options for securing
    RTP, see [RFC7201].\n"
