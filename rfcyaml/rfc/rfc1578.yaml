  - "1.  Introduction\n   The elementary and secondary school community of teachers,\
    \ media\n   specialists, administrators, and students is a growing population\
    \ on\n   the Internet.  In general, this group of users approaches the\n   Internet\
    \ with less experience in data network technology and fewer\n   technical and\
    \ user support resources than other Internet user groups.\n   Many of their questions\
    \ are related to the special needs of the\n   community, while others are shared\
    \ by any new user.  This document\n   attempts first to define the most frequently\
    \ asked questions related\n   to the use of the Internet in pre-university education\
    \ and then to\n   provide not only answers but also pointers to further information.\n\
    \   For new user questions of a more general nature, the reader should\n   get\
    \ FYI 4, \"FYI on Questions and Answers:  Answers to Commonly Asked\n   'New Internet\
    \ User' Questions\" [1].  For information on how to get\n   this document, see\
    \ Appendix B.\n   It is important to remember that the Internet is a volatile\
    \ and\n   changing virtual environment.  I have tried to include only the most\n\
    \   stable of network services when listing resources and groups for you\n   to\
    \ contact, which is a good solution to the problem of changing\n   offerings on\
    \ the Internet, but by no means a fool-proof one.  This\n   constant change also\
    \ means that there is a lot out there that you\n   will discover as you begin\
    \ to explore on your own.\n   Future updates of this document will be produced\
    \ as Internet School\n   Networking working group members are made aware of new\
    \ questions and\n   of insufficient or inaccurate information in the document.\
    \  The RFC\n   number of this document will change with each update, but the FYI\n\
    \   number (22) will remain the same.\n"

  - "3.  Questions About the Internet in an Educational Setting\n   3.1  What is the\
    \ Internet?\n      The Internet is a collection of more than 10,000 interconnected\n\
    \      computer networks around the world that make it possible to share\n   \
    \   information almost instantly.  The networks are owned by countless\n     \
    \ commercial, research, governmental, and educational organizations\n      and\
    \ individuals.  The Internet allows the more than 1.5 million\n      computers\
    \ and 10 millions users of the system to collaborate\n      easily and quickly\
    \ through messaging, discussion groups, and\n      conferencing.  Users are able\
    \ to discover and access people and\n      information, distribute information,\
    \ and experiment with new\n      technologies and services.  The Internet has\
    \ become a major global\n      infrastructure for education, research, professional\
    \ learning,\n      public service, and business and is currently growing at the\
    \ rate\n      of about ten percent per month.\n      The Internet Society serves\
    \ as the international organization for\n      Internet cooperation and coordination.\
    \  See Section 9, \"Resources\n      and Contacts\".\n      For a more complete\
    \ basic introduction to the Internet, see FYI\n      20, \"What is the Internet?\"\
    \ [2].  Instructions on retrieving FYI\n      documents can be found in Appendix\
    \ B.\n   3.2  What are the benefits of using the Internet in the classroom?\n\
    \      The Internet expands classroom resources dramatically by making\n     \
    \ many resources from all over the world available to students,\n      teachers,\
    \ and media specialists, including original source\n      materials.  It brings\
    \ information, data, images, and even computer\n      software into the classroom\
    \ from places otherwise impossible to\n      reach, and it does this almost instantly.\
    \  Access to these\n      resources can yield individual and group projects, collaboration,\n\
    \      curriculum materials, and idea sharing not found in schools\n      without\
    \ Internet access.\n      Internet access also makes contact with people all over\
    \ the world\n      possible, bringing into the classroom experts in every content\n\
    \      area, new and old friends, and colleagues in education.  With\n      access\
    \ to the Internet, your site can become a valuable source of\n      information\
    \ as well.  Consider the expertise in your school which\n      could be shared\
    \ with others around the world.\n      The isolation inherent in the teaching\
    \ profession is well-known\n      among educators.  By having access to colleagues\
    \ in other parts of\n      the world, as well as to those who work outside of\
    \ classrooms,\n      educators able to reach the Internet are not as isolated.\n\
    \      A hands-on classroom tool, the use of networks can be a motivator\n   \
    \   for students in and of itself, and their use encourages the kind\n      of\
    \ independence and autonomy that many educators agree is\n      important for\
    \ students to achieve in their learning process.\n      Because class, race, ability,\
    \ and disability are removed as\n      factors in communication while using the\
    \ Internet, it is a natural\n      tool for addressing  the needs of all students;\
    \ exactly how this\n      is done will vary from district to district as schools\
    \ empower\n      individual teachers and students.\n      School reform, which\
    \ is much on the minds of many educators today,\n      can be supported by the\
    \ use of the Internet as one of many\n      educational tools.  See the answer\
    \ to Question 4.1 for more\n      specifics.\n   3.3  How can educators incorporate\
    \ this resource into their busy\n        schedules?\n      Most educators learn\
    \ about the Internet during the time they use\n      to learn about any new teaching\
    \ tool or resource.  Realistically,\n      of course, this means they \"steal\"\
    \ time at lunch, on week-ends,\n      and before and after school to explore resources\
    \ and pursue\n      relationships via the Internet.  Those who do so feel that\
    \ it is\n      well worth the rich rewards.  It's important that computers used\n\
    \      to access the Internet are readily available and not so far away\n    \
    \  physically as to make using the resource impossible for educators\n      and\
    \ others.\n      Many features of the Internet, such as the availability of online\n\
    \      library catalogs and information articles, will actually end up\n     \
    \ saving considerable time once an instructor learns to use them,\n      and there\
    \ are new tools being developed all the time to make\n      Internet resources\
    \ more easily accessible.\n      As the value of the Internet as an educational\
    \ resource becomes\n      more evident, school systems will need to look toward\
    \ building the\n      time to use it into educators' schedules.\n   3.4  I'm already\
    \ using the National Geographic Kids Network (or PBS\n        Learning Link or\
    \ FrEdMail or ______).  Does this have anything\n        to do with the Internet?\
    \  Is the Internet different from what\n        I'm already using?\n      Since\
    \ the Internet is a network of many different networks, you\n      may be using\
    \ one of the networks which is connected to the\n      Internet.  Some commercial\
    \ programs for schools use networks and\n      provide value-added service, such\
    \ as curriculum software,\n      technical support, project organization and coordination,\
    \ etc.\n      Some provide value-added service, but don't allow for all basic\n\
    \      Internet services.  Networks like FrEdMail (Free Educational\n      Electronic\
    \ Mail), FidoNet, and K12Net are bulletin board and\n      conferencing systems\
    \ linked via the Internet which provide\n      inexpensive access to some Internet\
    \ services.  If you can use\n      interactive computer access (Telnet) and electronic\
    \ file transfer\n      (FTP), as well as electronic mail, you are probably \"\
    on\" the\n      Internet.  If you have questions about the specific service you're\n\
    \      currently using, ask its support personnel if you have Internet\n     \
    \ access, or call the InterNIC.  See Section 9, \"Resources and\n      Contacts\"\
    \ for how to reach the InterNIC, FrEdMail, FidoNet, and\n      K12Net.\n"

  - "4.  Questions About School Support for an Internet Connection\n   4.1  Where\
    \ does my school get the money for connecting to the\n        Internet?\n    \
    \  Although school budgets are impossibly tight in most cases, the\n      cost\
    \ of an Internet connection can be squeezed from the budget\n      when its value\
    \ becomes apparent.  Costs for a low end connection\n      can be quite reasonable.\
    \  (See the next question.)\n      The challenge facing those advocating an Internet\
    \ connection\n      sometimes has less to do with the actual cost than it has\
    \ with the\n      difficulty of convincing administrators to spend money on an\n\
    \      unfamiliar resource.\n      In order to move the Internet connection closer\
    \ to the top of your\n      school's priority list, consider at least two possibilities.\n\
    \      First, your school may be in the process of reform, as are many\n     \
    \ schools.  Because use of the Internet shifts focus away from a\n      teacher-as-expert\
    \ model and toward one of shared responsibility\n      for learning, it can be\
    \ a vital part of school reform.  Much of\n      school reform attempts to move\
    \ away from teacher isolation and\n      toward teacher collaboration, away from\
    \ learning in a school-only\n      context and toward learning in a life context,\
    \ away from an\n      emphasis on knowing and toward an emphasis on learning,\
    \ away from\n      a focus on content and toward a focus on concepts [3].  The\n\
    \      Internet can play an integral part in helping to achieve these\n      shifts.\n\
    \      Second, to demonstrate the value of a connection, actual Internet\n   \
    \   access is more useful than words.  While this may sound like a\n      chicken-and-egg\
    \ situation (I have to have Internet access to get\n      Internet access), some\
    \ organizations will provide guest accounts\n      on an Internet-connected computer\
    \ for people in schools who are\n      trying to convince others of the value\
    \ of an Internet connection.\n      Contact local colleges, universities, technology\
    \ companies,\n      service providers, community networks, and government agencies\
    \ for\n      both guest accounts and funding ideas.  For alternatives to your\n\
    \      own school's budget or for supplements to it, look for funding in\n   \
    \   federal, state, and district budgets as well as from private\n      grants.\
    \  Work with equipment vendors to provide the hardware\n      needed at low or\
    \ no cost to your school, and consider forming a\n      School/Community Technology\
    \ Committee, or a joint School\n      District/School/Community Technology Committee.\n\
    \      The Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) has\n      information\
    \ on grants and funding.  Ask for the AskERIC InfoGuide\n      called \"Grants\
    \ and Funding Sources\".  Two network services, one\n      maintained by the United\
    \ States Department of Education's Office\n      of Educational Research and Improvement\
    \ (OERI) and one maintained\n      by the US National Science Foundation, also\
    \ have information about\n      grants and funding.  Grants can be a way for you\
    \ to acquire the\n      initial money to demonstrate the value of telecommunications\
    \ in\n      the classroom, and since these monies are often awarded on a\n   \
    \   short-term basis, should probably be looked at as temporary means\n      of\
    \ funding your activities.  For information on these\n      organizations and\
    \ their services, see Section 9, \"Resources and\n      Contacts\".  (Note: The\
    \ funding services mentioned are primarily US\n      based.)\n   4.2  How much\
    \ does it cost to connect to the Internet, and what\n        kind of equipment\
    \ (hardware, software, etc.) does my school need\n        in order to support\
    \ an Internet connection?\n      The cost of an Internet connection varies tremendously\
    \ with the\n      location of your site and the kind of connection that is\n \
    \     appropriate to your needs.  In order to determine the cost to your\n   \
    \   school, you will need to answer a number of questions. For help in\n     \
    \ learning what the questions are and getting answers to them, begin\n      asking\
    \ at local colleges, universities, technology companies,\n      government agencies,\
    \ community networks (often called \"freenets\"),\n      local electronic bulletin\
    \ board systems (BBS), network access\n      providers, or technology consultants.\n\
    \      To give you an idea of possible equipment needs, here are three\n     \
    \ sample scenarios, based on possible solutions found in the United\n      States.\
    \  Keep in mind that these are very general examples and\n      that there are\
    \ many solutions at each level.  See also the answer\n      to Question 5.5.\n\
    \        Low-end: You could subscribe to some kind of Internet dial-up\n     \
    \   service.  This may be provided by a vendor at a cost, by a local\n       \
    \ university gratis, or as a part of a public access service like\n        a community\
    \ network.  You will need a computer which allows\n        terminal emulation,\
    \ terminal emulation software, and a modem\n        which is compatible with your\
    \ dial-up service.  The approximate\n        cost, not including the PC or the\
    \ cost of the phone call, is US\n        $100 to US $800 plus a monthly fee of\
    \ approximately US $30.\n        Mid-range: You could subscribe to a dial-up service\
    \ that\n        provides Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) or Point to Point\n\
    \        Protocol (PPP), allowing your computer to effectively become a\n    \
    \    host on the Internet.  You will need a computer with SLIP or PPP\n      \
    \  software, telecommunications applications software (to allow you\n        to\
    \ use telnet and FTP - File Transfer Protocol), and a modem\n        which is\
    \ compatible with your dial-up service.  The approximate\n        cost, not including\
    \ the PC or the cost of the phone call, is US\n        $100 to US $800 plus a\
    \ monthly fee of approximately US $60.\n        High-end: Your school or department\
    \ could subscribe to a service\n        that provides a full Internet connection\
    \ to the school or\n        department's local area network.  This allows all\
    \ the computers\n        on the local area network access to the Internet.  You\
    \ will need\n        a router and a connection to a network access provider's\
    \ router.\n        Typically the connection is a leased line with a CSU/DSU\n\
    \        (Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit).  A leased line is a\n     \
    \   permanent high speed telephone connection between two points;\n        this\
    \ allows you to have a high quality permanent Internet\n        connection at\
    \ all times.  A local area network, which may\n        consist only of the router\
    \ and a PC, Macintosh, or other\n        computer system, is also needed, and\
    \ your computer(s) will need\n        some special software:  a TCP/IP (Transmission\
    \ Control\n        Protocol/Internet Protocol) stack, as well as TCP/IP based\n\
    \        communications software such as Telnet and FTP.  The approximate\n  \
    \      cost, not including the computers, is US $2,000 to US $3,000\n        plus\
    \ a monthly fee of at least US $200.\n   4.3  What is required in terms of personnel\
    \ to support an Internet\n        connection?  (Will it require extra staff, training,\
    \ more time\n        of teachers and librarians?)\n      Any plan for implementing\
    \ technology in schools must consider\n      staff development.  Training is often\
    \ the most neglected aspect of\n      a technology plan, and a lack of training\
    \ can lead to failure of\n      the plan.  In the case of the Internet, all users\
    \ will need some\n      kind of training, whether they are teachers, librarians,\
    \ students,\n      administrators, or people fulfilling other roles in the school.\n\
    \      The train-the-trainer model, in which a group of people are\n      trained\
    \ in a subject or tool and each individual in turn trains\n      other groups,\
    \ is a good model for Internet training.  A small\n      group of motivated teachers\
    \ can be provided with training and can\n      then educate their colleagues.\
    \  One advantage is that the initial\n      group is able to target the specific\
    \ needs of the other teachers\n      in the school.\n      Depending on the hardware\
    \ involved, there may be a need for\n      technical support.  Finding this kind\
    \ of support, which schools\n      will certainly need because it is not usually\
    \ in place, may be\n      tricky.  Some districts are beginning to provide it\
    \ at the\n      district level.  Some schools are able to use volunteers from\n\
    \      business, industry, or government agencies.  Much of this type of\n   \
    \   support can be done over the network itself, which makes it\n      possible\
    \ for someone located off-site to maintain the equipment\n      with only occasional\
    \ trips to the school.  Additionally, vendors\n      often provide some support,\
    \ perhaps a help desk for basic\n      questions.\n   4.4  How do I convince the\
    \ people who do the purchasing in our school\n        system to spend money on\
    \ this?\n      Most people become convinced with exposure.  One excited\n    \
    \  individual in the school who is able to show proof of concept by\n      starting\
    \ a pilot program can be the catalyst for a school or an\n      entire district.\
    \  If you can get an Internet account (as suggested\n      above) and use it for\
    \ instruction in your classroom, you can make\n      presentations at faculty,\
    \ school/community, and school board\n      meetings.\n      The National Center\
    \ for Education Statistics in the Office of\n      Educational Research and Improvement\
    \ at the United States\n      Department of Education has released a 17-minute\
    \ video targeted at\n      school administrators entitled \"Experience the Power:\
    \ Network\n      Technology for Education\".  It uses interview clips of students,\n\
    \      teachers, and policy makers in the United States to educate about\n   \
    \   what the Internet is and to encourage support for the use of\n      telecommunications\
    \ in primary and secondary schools.  The NASA\n      NREN (US National Aeronautics\
    \ and Space Administration National\n      Research and Education Network) K-12\
    \ Initiative has produced an\n      11-minute video describing the benefits to\
    \ schools in using the\n      Internet.  The video is entitled, \"Global Quest:\
    \ The Internet in\n      the Classroom\", and it tells the story through interview\
    \ clips\n      with students and teachers who have experienced the power of\n\
    \      computer networking.  For further information on the two videos,\n    \
    \  see \"National Center for Education Statistics\", and \"NASA Central\n    \
    \  Operation of Resources for Educators\" under \"Organizations\" in\n      Section\
    \ 9, \"Resources and Contacts\".\n   4.5  Where do I go for technical support\
    \ and training?\n      Much technical support and training can be found by using\
    \ the\n      Internet itself.  You can send questions to people in the know and\n\
    \      join discussion lists and news groups that discuss and answer\n      questions\
    \ about support and training.  One such list is Tipsheet,\n      the Computer\
    \ Help and Tip Exchange, the purpose of which is to\n      provide a supportive\
    \ setting where people can ask questions or\n      discuss products.  Other lists\

  - "5.   Questions About Implementation and Technical Options\n   5.1  How do I learn\
    \ about options for getting my school connected?\n      In the United States,\
    \ there are a number of state-wide educational\n      networks, most of them with\
    \ access to the Internet.  To find out\n      if there is a state education network\
    \ in your area which gives\n      accounts to educators and/or students, contact\
    \ the Consortium for\n      School Networking.  The InterNIC has a list of regional\
    \ and\n      national network providers.  Both the Consortium for School\n   \
    \   Networking and the InterNIC are listed in Section 9, \"Resources\n      and\
    \ Contacts\".\n      The global regional NICs such as the RIPE NCC in Europe can\
    \ also\n      provide a list of service providers.  The APNIC in the Pacific Rim\n\
    \      will have a similar list in the near future.\n      You can sometimes locate\
    \ a person enthusiastic about the idea of\n      using networks in schools and\
    \ willing to help you who works as an\n      independent consultant, in a local\
    \ college or university, in a\n      technology company, for a network access\
    \ provider, at a community\n      network, or in a government agency.\n      There\
    \ are a number of books about the Internet and how to get\n      connected to\
    \ it.  A few are listed in Section 8, \"Suggested\n      Reading\", and more are\
    \ being published every month.  Check\n      libraries, bookstores, and booksellers'\
    \ catalogs.\n   5.2  How many of our computers should we put on the Internet?\n\
    \      You will probably want to make Internet *access* possible for as\n    \
    \  many of your school's computers as possible.  If you are using a\n      dial-up\
    \ service, you may want a number of shared accounts\n      throughout the school.\
    \  If your school has a Local Area Network\n      (LAN) with several computers\
    \ on it, one dedicated Internet\n      connection should be able to serve the\
    \ whole school.\n      If you are going to connect a lot of computers to the network,\
    \ you\n      will need to make sure your line speed is adequate.  Most dial-up\n\
    \      systems available today support speeds up to 14.4 Kbs (kilobits\n     \
    \ per second), which is adequate for no more than a couple of\n      network users,\
    \ depending upon the network utilities (FTP, etc.)\n      they are using.  If\
    \ you are planning to connect a large number of\n      users, you should probably\
    \ consider a dedicated line of 56 Kbs or\n      higher.\n   5.3  Should we set\
    \ up a telecommunications lab or put networked\n        computers in each classroom?\n\
    \      A computer lab is an easier maintenance set-up for the person in\n    \
    \  charge of keeping the equipment running and allows each individual\n      (or\
    \ pair) in an entire class to be using a computer at the same\n      time; a computer\
    \ located in the classroom is more convenient for\n      both the teacher and\
    \ the class.  If you choose the lab option, you\n      will probably want to get\
    \ a commitment from specific teachers or\n      media specialists to use the lab\
    \ in the course of their teaching.\n      You might also consider the other labs\
    \ located throughout your\n      school.  For example, if you have a science or\
    \ language lab, it\n      may be the best place for your school to begin to use\
    \ the\n      Internet.  And finally, remember that the library is a natural\n\
    \      place for people to access network resources!\n      Networking all computers\
    \ campus-wide can be expensive.  You will\n      need to consider the options--dial-up\
    \ access, a dedicated line, or\n      some other possibility--and weigh them against\
    \ your school's needs\n      and priorities.  You may want to investigate having\
    \ one lab, the\n      library, and a few classrooms with modem access, assuming\
    \ phone\n      lines are available.  As use of the Internet catches on, it will\n\
    \      be more effective to create a campus-wide local area network that\n   \
    \   is routed to the Internet through a dedicated line than to keep\n      adding\
    \ modems in classrooms.  Or you may want to consider the\n      other options\
    \ discussed in question 5.5 below.\n   5.4  Can people get on the Internet from\
    \ home?\n      This depends on your network access provider.  It is certainly\
    \ a\n      possibility and is probably desirable for the educators at your\n \
    \     school if they happen to have the necessary equipment at home.\n      You\
    \ will need to discuss whether you want to make this option\n      available to\
    \ students even if it is possible technically.  This is\n      best discussed\
    \ with the community your school serves in a public\n      forum such as a school/community\
    \ meeting.  At issue is the shared\n      responsibility of educators and parents\
    \ to monitor student\n      Internet use.  (See also Question 6.2.)\n   5.5  What\
    \ are some of the options for using Internet services without\n        paying\
    \ for a full, dedicated-line Internet connection?\n      It is possible to create\
    \ a local, store-and-forward network using\n      various implementations of the\
    \ Unix to Unix Copy (UUCP) software\n      suite, available as public domain (free)\
    \ or shareware (small fee\n      which is often optional) software, which can\
    \ run on many different\n      platforms including Amiga, IBM, and Macintosh.\
    \  The connections\n      are via dial-up phone lines using local phone numbers.\
    \  Usenet\n      News and email are \"stored\" on a computer until the time appointed\n\
    \      for that computer to contact the next one along the path to the\n     \
    \ final destination, at which time it is \"forwarded\" along its way.\n      Most\
    \ computers are set up to process outgoing requests at least\n      every 30 minutes.\
    \  With this type of system you will have access\n      to as many Usenet News\
    \ groups as your site agrees to carry, as\n      well as email, which includes\
    \ access to mailing lists and\n      listservs such as those listed in Section\
    \ 9, \"Resources and\n      Contacts\".  Many file servers also offer file transfer\
    \ and other\n      services via email.\n      There are a couple of important\
    \ advantages to such a system.\n      First, it is much more affordable since\
    \ such networks provide more\n      efficient use of telephone lines, making a\
    \ connection only while\n      data is actually being transferred.  Second, it\
    \ allows for\n      filtering, which gives a school some control over what kind\
    \ of\n      information is available to its students.\n      The disadvantage\
    \ to this type of Internet access is that you may\n      be limited regarding\
    \ the range of Internet applications you can\n      use.\n      FrEdMail, FidoNet,\
    \ and K12Net are store-and-forward systems.\n      FidoNet, for example, is a\
    \ network of amateurs and hobbyists which\n      operates on personal computers\
    \ and is publicly accessible by\n      anyone with a microcomputer and a modem.\
    \  Contact information for\n      all three organizations can be found in Section\
    \ 9, \"Resources and\n      Contacts\".\n"

  - "6.  Questions About Security and Ethics\n   6.1  Who should have access in the\
    \ school, the teachers or the\n        students?\n      Clearly the answer is\
    \ that all educators, including administrators\n      and media specialists or\
    \ librarians, AND students should have\n      access to the Internet.  There's\
    \ no reason why support staff\n      should not also have access.  In elementary\
    \ schools, access for\n      students may be more supervised than in the upper\
    \ grades.\n   6.2  I've heard that there are files on the Internet that parents\n\
    \        would not like their children to get.  How can students be\n        kept\
    \ from accessing this objectionable material?\n      If your school has a direct\
    \ Internet connection, and often even if\n      it doesn't, it is not possible\
    \ to use a technical solution to\n      prevent students from accessing objectionable\
    \ material.  Everyone\n      on the network, including students, is able to download\
    \ files from\n      public electronic repositories, some of which contain materials\n\
    \      that just about anyone would consider objectionable for school-age\n  \
    \    children.  The store-and-forward scenario described in Question\n      5.5\
    \ is one solution to filtering the information to which students\n      have access,\
    \ but if students are allowed to use email then it is\n      possible for someone\
    \ to send them objectionable material.\n      For this reason, it is important\
    \ that schools develop clear\n      policies to guide students' use of the Internet\
    \ and establish\n      rules, and consequences for breaking them, that govern\
    \ behavior on\n      the Internet.  Additionally, schools should consider integrating\n\
    \      issues around technology and ethics into the curriculum [4].\n      Another\
    \ possibility is to control the times and opportunities that\n      students have\
    \ to access the Internet, and only allow access under\n      supervision.  This\
    \ is a less desirable option than teaching the\n      ethics of Internet access\
    \ as a matter of course, but may be used\n      in combination with other methods\
    \ to ensure the integrity of the\n      school, its students, and its educators.\n\
    \      In any case, schools need to exercise reasonable oversight while\n    \
    \  realizing that it is almost impossible to absolutely guarantee\n      that\
    \ students will not be able to access objectionable material.\n   6.3  How do\
    \ we keep our own and other people's computers safe from\n        student \"hackers\"\
    ?\n      In the language of computer folks, a \"hacker\" is someone who is\n \
    \     excellent at understanding and manipulating computer systems. A\n      \"\
    cracker\" is someone who maliciously and/or illegally enters or\n      attempts\
    \ to enter someone else's computer system.\n      Computer security is unquestionably\
    \ important, both in maintaining\n      the security of the school's computers\
    \ and in ensuring the proper\n      behavior of the school's students (and others\
    \ who use the\n      network).  In this area, not only school policy, but also\
    \ state\n      and national laws may apply.  Two sources of information which\
    \ you\n      can read to help you sort through security issues are:\n        \"\
    Site Security Handbook\" (FYI 8)\n        \"Ethical Uses of Information Technologies\
    \ in Education\"\n        (Sivin & Bialo)\n      The full references for these\
    \ documents can be found in Section 8,\n      \"Suggested Reading\".  The pamphlet\
    \ \"Ethical Uses of Information\n      Technologies in Education\" is more applicable\
    \ to the laws of the\n      United States than to those of other countries, but\
    \ several of the\n      ideas are shared in various cultures.\n   6.4  How do\
    \ we keep viruses from attacking all our computers if we\n        get connected\
    \ to the Internet?\n      If you use the Internet to exchange data (such as text\
    \ or\n      pictures), virus infection is generally not a problem.  The real\n\
    \      concern is when you download software programs and run them on\n      your\
    \ own computer.  Any program you download over the network and\n      run could\
    \ have a virus.  For that matter, any program, whether on\n      tape or a disk,\
    \ even commercial software still in its original\n      packaging, might possibly\
    \ have a virus.  For this reason, all\n      computers should have virus protection\
    \ software running on them.\n      Virus checking software is available free over\
    \ the Internet via\n      Anonymous FTP from the Computer Emergency Response Team\
    \ (CERT),\n      which is run by the US National Institute for Standards and\n\
    \      Technology (NIST).  The Anonymous FTP host computer is\n      ftp.cert.org.\
    \  (For information on using Anonymous FTP, see\n      Appendix B.)  Your hardware\
    \ or software vendor, your network\n      access provider, your technical support\
    \ resources, or your\n      colleagues on network mailing lists should be able\
    \ to provide more\n      specific information applicable to your site.\n     \
    \ To help reduce the risk of downloading a virus with your program,\n      try\
    \ to use trusted sources.  Ask someone you know or send the\n      question to\
    \ a mailing list or news group to find the most reliable\n      sites for software\
    \ access.\n   6.5  What are the rules for using the Internet?\n      When your\
    \ Internet connection is established, your access provider\n      should acquaint\
    \ you with their Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).  This\n      policy explains the\
    \ acceptable and non-acceptable uses for your\n      connection.  For example,\
    \ it is in all cases unacceptable to use\n      the network for illegal purposes.\
    \  It may, in some cases, be\n      unacceptable to use the network for commercial\
    \ purposes.  If such\n      a policy is not mentioned, ask for it.  All users\
    \ are expected to\n      know what the acceptable and unacceptable uses of their\
    \ network\n      are.  Remember that it is essential to establish a school-wide\n\
    \      policy in addition to the provider's AUP.\n"

  - "7.   Questions About Educational Collaboration, Projects, and Resources\n   7.1\
    \  How can I find specific projects using the Internet that are\n        already\
    \ developed?\n      There are a several resources on the Internet that are directed\n\
    \      specifically at the primary and secondary school communities, and\n   \
    \   the number is growing.  The InterNIC gopher server has a section\n      on\
    \ K-12 (Kindergarten through 12th grade) Education, the\n      Consortium for\
    \ School Networking maintains a gopher server, and\n      NASA's Spacelink is\
    \ directed at primary and secondary school\n      educators.  NYSERNet's Empire\
    \ Internet Schoolhouse is an extension\n      of its Bridging the Gap program.\
    \  For access to these and others,\n      see Section 9, \"Resources and Contacts\"\
    .\n      Many people on electronic mailing lists such as Ednet, Kidsphere,\n \
    \     and the Consortium for School Networking Discussion List\n      (cosndisc)\
    \ post their projects and ask for partners and\n      collaborators.  The K12\
    \ hierarchy of Usenet News has several\n      groups where educators post these\
    \ invitations as well.  For\n      subscription to these and other electronic\
    \ lists and for names of\n      news groups, see Section 9, \"Resources and Contacts\"\
    .  For news\n      groups and mailing lists of special interest to educators,\
    \ see the\n      \"Ednet Guide to Usenet Newsgroups\" and \"An Educator's Guide\
    \ to E-\n      Mail Lists\", both of which are listed in Section 8, \"Suggested\n\
    \      Reading\".\n      As you explore the Internet, there are some tools that\
    \ will help\n      you find projects that are already developed.  A good overview\
    \ of\n      many of these resource discovery tools is the \"Guide to Network\n\
    \      Resource Tools\" written by the European Academic Research Networks\n \
    \     (EARN) Association.  It explains the basics of tools such as\n      Gopher,\
    \ Veronica, WAIS, Archie, and the World Wide Web, as well as\n      others, and\
    \ provides pointers for finding out more about these\n      useful tools.  It\
    \ is listed in Section 8, \"Suggested Reading\".\n   7.2  Where do I go to find\
    \ colleagues who support networking and\n        schools willing to participate\
    \ in projects?\n      The electronic mailing lists and Usenet News groups in Section\
    \ 9,\n      \"Resources and Contacts\" are rich with people who want to\n    \
    \  collaborate on projects involving use of the Internet.\n      There are also\
    \ a number of conferences you may want to look in to.\n      The National Education\
    \ Computing Conference (NECC) is held\n      annually, as is Tel-Ed, a conference\
    \ sponsored by the\n      International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE).\
    \  ISTE\n      maintains an online server which has a calendar of conferences\
    \ all\n      over the world in telecommunications for education.  The INET\n \
    \     conference is the annual conference for the Internet Society.  See\n   \
    \   Section 9, \"Resources and Contacts\", for contact information for\n     \
    \ these organizations and for information on access to ISTE's online\n      server.\n\
    \   7.3  What are some examples of how the Internet is being used in\n       \
    \ classrooms now?\n      Projects which use the Internet sometimes request sites\
    \ from all\n      over the world to contribute data from the local area then compile\n\
    \      that data for use by all.  Weather patterns, pollutants in water\n    \
    \  or air, and Monarch butterfly migration are some of the data that\n      has\
    \ been collected over the Internet.  In Appendix A you will find\n      several\
    \ examples from the Kidsphere electronic mailing list, each\n      from a different\
    \ content area and representing different ways of\n      using the Internet.\n\
    \      There are a number of specific projects you may find interesting.\n   \
    \   KIDS-94 (and subsequent years), managed by the non-profit KIDLINK\n      Society,\
    \ is one.  It currently includes ten discussion lists and\n      services, some\
    \ of them only for people who are ten through fifteen\n      years old.  Another\
    \ place to look is Academy One of the National\n      Public Telecomputing Network\
    \ (NPTN), which usually has between 5\n      and 10 projects running at a time.\
    \  The International Education\n      and Research Network (I*EARN), a project\
    \ of the non-profit Copen\n      Family Fund, facilitates telecommunications in\
    \ schools around the\n      world.  Chatback Trust, initiated to provide email\
    \ for schools in\n      the United Kingdom and around the world with students\
    \ who have\n      mental or physical difficulty with communicating, and Chatback\n\
    \      International, directed at any school on the Internet, maintain a\n   \
    \   network server that you may want to investigate.  The European\n      Schools\
    \ Project involves approximately 200 schools in 20 countries\n      and has as\
    \ its goal building a support system for secondary school\n      educators.  For\
    \ contact information on these groups and server\n      access, refer to Section\
    \ 9, \"Resources and Contacts\".\n   7.4  Is there a manual that lists sites on\
    \ the Internet particularly\n        useful for class exploration?\n      There\
    \ are a number of resource guides, and so far only a couple\n      are directed\
    \ specifically at an education audience.  \"An\n      Incomplete Guide to the\
    \ Internet and Other Telecommunications\n      Opportunities Especially for Teachers\
    \ and Students K-12\" is\n      compiled by the NCSA Education Group and is available\
    \ online.  The\n      \"Internet Resource Directory for Educators, Version 2\"\
    \ is also\n      available online.  It was prepared by a team of 46 teachers in\n\
    \      Nebraska and Texas who were enrolled in telecomputing courses at\n    \
    \  two universities in 1992 and 1993.  Ednet's \"Educator's Guide to\n      Email\
    \ Lists\" is available electronically, as is the \"Ednet Guide\n      to Usenet\
    \ News Groups\".  ERIC offers several documents relating to\n      telecommunications\
    \ and education, including the ERIC Digest\n      \"Internet Basics\", the ERIC\
    \ Review \"K-12 Networking\",\n      \"Instructional Development for Distance\

    \ \"Suggested\n      Reading\".  For help in retrieving the documents electronically,\n\
    \      see Appendix B.\n      There are also printed guides to the Internet appearing\
    \ along with\n      the new books on the Internet.  The problem with paper resource\n\
    \      guides is that the Internet is a changing environment, so they\n      become\
    \ outdated quickly.  Check libraries, bookstores, and\n      booksellers' catalogs\
    \ for these guides.\n      One answer to the problem of printed Internet guides\
    \ is the\n      newsletter.  NetTEACH NEWS is a newsletter specifically for\n\
    \      primary and secondary school educators interested in networking.\n    \
    \  It contains information on new services on the Internet that are\n      of\
    \ interest to educators, projects for collaboration, conferences,\n      new books\
    \ and publications, and includes \"The Instruction Corner\",\n      which gives\
    \ practical tutorials on using network tools and\n      services.  NetTEACH NEWS\
    \ is published ten times a year, and is\n      available both hardcopy and via\
    \ email.  Subscription information\n      can be found in Section 9, \"Resources\

    \ exists expressly for the sharing of ideas by the\n      elementary and secondary\
    \ school community.  Educators are\n      encouraged to submit projects, lesson\
    \ plans, and ideas.  A gopher\n      server maintained by PSGnet and RAINet also\
    \ accepts educator\n      submissions for addition to the many sections of its\
    \ menu tree\n      devoted to elementary and secondary school interests.  See\
    \ Section\n      9, \"Resources and Contacts\" for information on reaching CoSN\
    \ or\n      submitting materials, and for access to the server maintained by\n\
    \      PSGnet and RAINet.  It is important to remember that anything you\n   \
    \   create should be updated for others as you make changes yourself\n      in\
    \ the course of your learning by experience.\n      The electronic mail lists\
    \ and news groups mentioned are also\n      places to share your knowledge and\
    \ yourself as a resource, and as\n      you gain experience you may find you have\
    \ the knowledge to put up\n      an electronic server at your own site.  A group\
    \ of schools in\n      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States shares one\
    \ such\n      server, and there you could recently find and download to your own\n\
    \      computer photographs and notes from an exhibit on the architecture\n  \
    \    of one of the elementary schools.\n"

  - "APPENDIX A:  EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS USING THE INTERNET\n   The following examples\
    \ of projects using the Internet appeared on the\n   Kidsphere electronic mailing\
    \ list during the 1992-93 school year.\n   The messages have been edited in the\
    \ interest of space and because\n   many of the details about how to participate\
    \ are dated, but the\n   information presented can give you a feel for the types\
    \ and range of\n   projects that happen today.\n   =========================================\n\
    \   Example One, \"Middle School Math Project\"\n   =========================================\n\
    \   This is the official invitation to participate in \"Puzzle Now!\".\n   \"\
    Puzzle Now!\" is an interdisciplinary project using educational\n   technology\
    \ as a tool to integrate the curriculum.  \"Puzzle Now!\"\n   provides teams of\
    \ mathematics and language arts teachers and students\n   with thematic puzzle\
    \ problems via VA.PEN.\n   PROJECT       :  Puzzle Now!\n   SUBJECT AREA  :  Mathematics/Language\
    \ Arts\n   GRADE LEVEL   :  6 - 8\n   DURATION      :  This project will consist\
    \ of eight - one week\n                    cycles.\n   PROJECT GOALS :  -to increase\
    \ student motivation for math\n                    problem solving;\n        \
    \            -to emphasize the importance of addressing\n                    \
    \ problems in a clear, concise, and logical\n                     manner;\n  \
    \                  -to provide students with opportunities for\n             \
    \        developing skills in written expression;\n                    -to familiarize\
    \ students with computer and\n                     modem as tools for problem\
    \ solving projects.\n   PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\n                    The puzzles\
    \ presented in this project are no\n                    mere entertainment.  These\
    \ puzzles will help\n                    the student reason logically, develop\
    \ thinking\n                    skills, and will assist in the understanding of\n\
    \                    many practical disciplines, such as geometry.\n         \
    \           IT IS VERY IMPORTANT to remember that getting\n                  \
    \  the correct answer isn't as important as\n                    figuring out\
    \ how to find it.\n                    DO THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO BE SUBMITTED IN\
    \ A\n                    PARTICULAR FASHION?  Yes, the solution format\n     \
    \               requires that the group/team/individual first\n              \
    \      1) restate the puzzle/problem; 2) explain the\n                    strategy,\
    \ or strategies used in finding the\n                    answer;  3) state the\
    \ answer.\n                    Your team/class may turn in only one solution.\n\
    \                    That means you must work together to develop one\n      \

    \ SCIENCE AND MATH EXPERIMENT\n                        ERATOSTHENES EXPERIMENT\n\
    \   Eratosthenes, a Greek geographer (about 276 to 194 B.C.), made a\n   surprisingly\
    \ accurate estimate of the earth's circumference.  In the\n   great library in\
    \ Alexandria he read that a deep vertical well near\n   Syene, in southern Egypt,\
    \ was entirely lit up by the sun at noon once\n   a year.  Eratosthenes reasoned\
    \ that at this time sun must be directly\n   overhead, with its rays shining directly\
    \ into the well.  In\n   Alexandria, almost due north of Syene, he knew that the\

    \   is round and that the sun's rays are essentially parallel.  He set up\n  \
    \ a vertical post at Alexandria and measured the angle of its shadow\n   when\
    \ the well at Syene was completely sunlit.  Eratosthenes knew from\n   geometry\
    \ that the size of the measured angle equaled the size of the\n   angle at the\
    \ earth's center between Syene and Alexandria.  Knowing\n   also that the arc\
    \ of an angle this size was 1/50 of a circle, and\n   that the distance between\
    \ Syene and Alexandria was 5000 stadia, he\n   multiplied 5000 by 50 to find the\
    \ earth's circumference.  His result,\n   250,000 stadia (about 46,250 km) is\
    \ quite close to modern\n   measurements.  Investigating the Earth, AGI, l970,\

  - "APPENDIX B:  HOW TO GET DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY\n   The traditional way to access\
    \ files available online on the Internet\n   is via a program based on the File\
    \ Transfer Protocol (FTP).  Many\n   information sites have hosts that allow \"\
    anonymous\" FTP, meaning you\n   don't need to already have an account on the\
    \ host in order to access\n   the files it makes public.  This appendix will describe\
    \ obtaining\n   files via anonymous FTP and describe obtaining files via the Internet\n\
    \   Gopher program.\n   The online files sited in Suggested Reading can all be\
    \ retrieved via\n   anonymous FTP. (Most can also be retrieved via Gopher.)  In\
    \ most\n   cases, when you see a reference to a file available for FTP, the\n\
    \   reference will give you both a computer hostname and a pathname.  So,\n  \
    \ for example, the ASCII text version of the EARN Resource Tool Guide\n   is on\
    \ the host naic.nasa.gov in the /files/general_info directory as\n   earn-resource-tool-guide.txt.\n\
    \   Many online files are mirrored on more than one host.  RFC files, for\n  \
    \ example, are so popular that several hosts act as repositories for\n   them;\
    \ so, when they are cited, rarely is a hostname given.  To find\n   out all about\
    \ getting RFCs and FYIs, send a message to rfc-\n   info@isi.edu and in the body\
    \ of the message, type 'help:\n   ways_to_get_rfcs'.  RFCs are available both\
    \ via electronic mail and\n   via Anonymous FTP, as well as via many Gophers.\n\
    \   Anonymous FTP\n      Some of this information about transferring files based\
    \ on text\n      from the access.guide file referenced in FYI 19 [5] and written\
    \ by\n      Ellen Hoffman and Lenore Jackson.\n      If you are on a computer\
    \ connected to the Internet and can use\n      FTP, you can access files online.\
    \  If your VM/CMS, VAX/VMS, UNIX,\n      DOS, Macintosh, or other computer system\
    \ has FTP capability, you\n      can probably use the sample commands as they\
    \ are listed.  If your\n      computer doesn't work using the sample commands,\
    \ you may still\n      have FTP access.  You will need to ask your system administrator\n\
    \      or local network consultant.  If you don't have FTP, you may be\n     \
    \ able to get files via electronic mail.\n      If you are using a UNIX machine,\
    \ you can use FTP directly from a\n      system prompt.  For other computers,\
    \ there are commercial and\n      public domain programs that will allow you to\
    \ use FTP.  (For\n      example, there is a very easy-to-use shareware program\
    \ called\n      \"Fetch\" for the Macintosh.)\n      Once you establish that you\
    \ have FTP access, you will need to send\n      a series of commands to reach\
    \ the host computer with the file you\n      want, connect to the appropriate\
    \ directory, and have the file\n      transferred to your computer.  A typical\
    \ FTP session is described\n      here, but not all software is exactly alike.\
    \  If you have\n      problems, check your software's documentation ('man' page)\
    \ or\n      contact your local help-desk.\n      This session uses the EARN Guide\
    \ to Network Resource Tools in its\n      naic.nasa.gov home as an example file\
    \ to be transferred.\n      Here's what you can do:\n      (1) Tell your computer\
    \ what host you are trying to reach:\n                    ftp naic.nasa.gov\n\
    \      (2) Log in to the computer with the username \"anonymous\".  You\n    \
    \      will be prompted for a password; most often it is preferred\n         \
    \ that you use your complete email address as your password.\n      (3) Navigate\
    \ through the directory to find the file you need.  Two\n          useful commands\
    \ for doing so are the one to change directories\n          ('cd'), which you\
    \ can use to step through more than one directory\n          at a time:\n    \
    \                cd files/general_info\n          and the command which shows\
    \ you the files and subdirectories\n          within a directory:\n          \
    \          dir\n      (4) Give a command to have the file sent to your computer:\n\
    \                    get earn-resource-tools.txt\n      (5) Quit FTP:\n      \
    \              quit\n      RFC Repositories:\n      Following is a list of hosts\
    \ that are primary repositories for\n      RFCs, and, for each host, the pathname\
    \ to the directory that\n      houses these files:\n        - ds.internic.net\
    \     rfc\n        - nis.nsf.net         internet/documents/rfc\n        - nisc.jvnc.net\
    \       rfc\n        - venera.isi.edu      in-notes\n        - wuarchive.wustl.edu\
    \ info/rfc\n        - src.doc.ic.ac.uk    rfc\n        - ftp.concert.net     /rfc\n\
    \      RFCs are in the file format you see in the Suggested Readings\n      section,\
    \ e.g., rfc####.txt, with #### being the number of the RFC.\n      To retrieve\
    \ an RFC, then, you would FTP to a host above, log in as\n      anonymous, cd\
    \ to the directory noted, and retrieve the RFC you\n      want.  The file ways_to_get_rfcs,\
    \ mentioned above, explains which\n      sites make RFCs available for electronic\
    \ mail retrieval, and\n      provides directions for doing so.\n      Remember\
    \ that FYI documents, such as this one, are also RFCs, so\n      the information\
    \ about RFCs applies to FYIs as well.  You can\n      usually retrieve FYIs either\
    \ by their RFC number, or by their FYI\n      number.  FYI numbers are in the\
    \ format fyi##.txt, where ## is the\n      number of the FYI.\n   Gopher\n   \
    \   A relatively new method of viewing and retrieving information is\n      the\
    \ Internet Gopher.  A Gopher server presents information to a\n      users via\
    \ a series of menus.  By choosing menu items, the user is\n      led to files\
    \ or to other services available on the Internet.\n      Gopher can also retrieve\
    \ files for the user because it has an\n      interface to the File Transfer Protocol.\
    \  So you can use Gopher to\n      obtain files rather than FTP.  Once you have\
    \ located a file you\n      want, you also have the option of mailing it electronically.\n\
    \      Several Gopher servers are listed in the Network Servers portion\n    \
    \  of Section 9 \"Resources and Contacts\".  The InterNIC gopher, for\n      example,\
    \ is one that provides access to the RFCs.\n      Normally, the best way to access\
    \ a Gopher server is by running a\n      Gopher client on your own host or network.\
    \  However, if you do not\n      have that software, many Gophers are accessible\
    \ via Telnet (see\n      the addresses in Section 9).  To Telnet to a host, most\
    \ often you\n      would give the command \"telnet\" and the hostname, for example:\n\
    \      telnet naic.nasa.gov.\n      Unlike FTP repositories, which are accessible\
    \ over the network but\n      which you have to access one at a time, many Gophers\
    \ are linked\n      together over the Internet.  Therefore, if you have access\
    \ to one\n      Gopher, you usually have access to hundreds more.  This huge\n\
    \      network of gophers and the vast amount of information they serve\n    \
    \  is referred to as \"gopherspace\".  You can use a service within\n      Gopher\
    \ called \"Veronica\" to search gopherspace to see if there is\n      more information\
    \ out there of a particular type you are interested\n      in finding.  From within\
    \ Gopher, look for a menu item such as\n      \"Search Gopherspace Using Veronica\"\
    \ to find out more information\n      about using the Veronica service.\n"

    \ of three contractors, each of which focuses on\n      a particular network support\
    \ task.  The three tasks are:\n      Information Services (the task most often\
    \ cited in this document),\n      Registration Services, and Directory and Database\
    \ Services.\n   Kbs (Kilo-Bits per Second)\n      A data transmission rate expressed\

    \ per second.\n   LAN (Local Area Network)\n      A data network intended to serve\
    \ an area of only a few square\n      kilometers or less.  Since such are networks\
    \ relatively small they\n      can usually be directly controlled by the users\
    \ and operate at\n      relatively high speeds (up to 100Mb/s [10 million bits\
    \ per\n      second]) over inexpensive wiring.\n   Leased line\n      A leased\
    \ line is a special phone company permanent connection\n      between two locations.\
    \  Leased lines are generally used where\n      high-speed data (usually 960 characters\
    \ per second and higher) is\n      continually exchanged between two computers\
    \ (in the Internet,\n      generally between routers).  A leased line is billed\
    \ at the same\n      rate per month independent of how much the line is used and\
    \ can be\n      cheaper than using dial modems depending on the usage.  Leased\n\
    \      lines may also be used where higher data rates are needed beyond\n    \
    \  what a dial modem can provide.\n   Listserv (mailing list server)\n      An\
    \ automated program that accepts mail messages from users and\n      performs\
    \ basic operations on mailing lists for those users.  In\n      the Internet,\
    \ listservs are usually accessed as \"listname@host\";\n      for example, the\
    \ list server for the hypothetical list\n      \"newsreports@acme.org\" would\
    \ be called \"listserv@acme.org\".\n      Sending email to \"newsreports@acme.org\"\
    \ causes the message to be\n      sent to all the list subscribers, while sending\
    \ a message (to\n      subscribe or unsubscribe, for example) to \"listserv@acme.org\"\
    \n      sends the message only to the list server.  Not all mailing lists\n  \
    \    use list servers to handle list administration duties.\n   Mailing Lists\n\
    \      A list of email addresses.  Generally, a mailing list is used to\n    \
    \  discuss certain set of topics, and different mailing lists discuss\n      different\
    \ topics.  A mailing list may be moderated, that is\n      messages sent to the\
    \ list are actually sent to a moderator who\n      determines whether or not to\
    \ send the messages on to everyone\n      else.  Many mailing lists are maintained\
    \ by a \"listserv\" (list\n      server) program that automatically handles operations\
    \ such as\n      adding new people to the list.  (See above.)  In the Internet,\
    \ for\n      those mailing lists maintained by a human, rather than by a\n   \
    \   listserv, you can generally subscribe to a list by sending a mail\n      message\
    \ to: \"listname-REQUEST@host\" and in the body of the message\n      enter a\
    \ request to subscribe.  To send messages to other\n      subscribers, you will\
    \ then use the address \"listname@host\".\n   Modem (MODulator/DEModulator)\n\
    \      A device that converts the digital signals used by computers into\n   \
    \   analog signals needed by voice telephone systems.  Modems can be\n      \"\
    dial\" or \"leased line\" type.  Dial type modems are used on normal\n      telephone\
    \ lines to call remote computers, and usually operate at\n      speeds between\
    \ 120 to 1,920 characters per second.\n   Network Access Provider (Network Service\
    \ Provider)\n      Any organization that provides network connectivity or dial-up\n\
    \      access.  Service providers may be corporations, government\n      agencies,\
    \ universities, or other organizations.\n   Network News\n      Another name for\
    \ \"Usenet News\".\n   NIC (Network Information Center)\n      A central place\
    \ where information about a network within the\n      Internet is maintained.\
    \  Usually NICs are staffed by personnel who\n      answer user telephone calls\
    \ and electronic mail, and provide\n      general network usage information and\
    \ referrals, among other\n      possible tasks.  Most network service providers\
    \ also provide a NIC\n      for their users.\n   Port\n      TCP/IP assigns at\
    \ least one address to a host computer, but\n      applications such as FTP must\
    \ talk to a corresponding server\n      application on the host.  The \"port\"\
    \ is the way TCP/IP designates\n      the remote application.  Most common Internet\
    \ servers have\n      specific port numbers associated with them.  For example,\
    \ Telnet\n      uses port number 23.  These are known as \"well known ports\"\
    \ and\n      allow application programmers to write standard applications (such\n\
    \      as Telnet, FTP, etc.) that \"know\" where the corresponding server\n  \
    \    is on a particular host.\n   PPP  (Point to Point Protocol)\n      A protocol\
    \ used to establish TCP/IP connections using serial lines\n      such as dial-up\
    \ telephone lines.  Similar to SLIP (see below), PPP\n      is a later standard\
    \ that includes features such as demand dial-up,\n      compression, better flow\
    \ control, etc.\n   Protocol\n      A formal description of message formats and\
    \ the rules two\n      computers must follow to exchange those messages.  Protocols\
    \ can\n      describe low-level details of machine-to-machine interfaces (e.g.,\n\
    \      the order in which bits and bytes are sent across a wire) or\n      high-level\
    \ exchanges between allocation programs (e.g., the way in\n      which two programs\
    \ transfer a file across the Internet).\n   Protocol Stack\n      A series of\
    \ protocols linked together to provide an end-to-end\n      service.  For example,\
    \ the File Transfer Protocol uses the\n      Transmission Control Protocol, which\
    \ uses the Internet Protocol,\n      which may use the Point to Point protocol,\
    \ to transfer a file from\n      one computer to another.  The series FTP->TCP->IP->PPP\
    \ is called a\n      protocol stack.\n   RFC (Request for Comments)\n      The\
    \ document series, begun in 1969, which describes the Internet\n      suite of\
    \ protocols and related experiments.  Not all (in fact very\n      few) RFCs describe\
    \ Internet standards, but all Internet standards\n      are written up as RFCs.\
    \  The RFCs include the documentary record\n      of the Internet standards process.\n\
    \   Router\n      A computer which forwards traffic between networks.  The\n \
    \     forwarding decision is based on network layer information and\n      routing\
    \ tables, often constructed by routing protocols.\n   SLIP (Serial Line Internet\
    \ Protocol)\n      A protocol used to establish TCP/IP connections using serial\
    \ lines\n      such as dial-up telephone lines.  Small computers, such as PCs\
    \ and\n      Macintoshes, can use SLIP to dial up to servers, which then allow\n\
    \      the computer to act as a full Internet node.  SLIP is generally\n     \
    \ used at sites with a few users as a cheaper alternative than a\n      full Internet\
    \ connection.  SLIP is being replaced by PPP at many\n      sites.\n   TCP/IP\
    \ (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)\n      TCP/IP is named for\
    \ two of the major communications protocols used\n      within the Internet (TCP\
    \ and IP).  These protocols (along with\n      several others) provide the basic\
    \ foundation for communications\n      between hosts in the Internet.  All of\
    \ the service protocols, such\n      as FTP, Telnet, Gopher, use TCP/IP to transfer\
    \ information.\n   Telnet\n      Telnet is the Internet standard protocol for\
    \ remote terminal\n      connection service.  The name \"telnet\" also is used\
    \ to refer to\n      programs that allow interactive access to remote computers,\
    \ as\n      well as the action of using said programs.  For example, the\n   \
    \   phrase \"Telnet to host xyzzy.\" means to interactively log into\n      host\
    \ \"xyzzy\" from some other host in the Internet.\n   Upload\n      To copy data\
    \ from a local computer to a remote computer.  The\n      opposite of download.\n\
    \   Usenet News\n      An electronic bulletin board system created originally\
    \ by the Unix\n      community and which is accessible via the Internet.  Usenet\
    \ News\n      forms a discussion forum accessible by millions of users in almost\n\
    \      every country in the world.  Usenet News consists of thousands of\n   \
    \   topics arranged in a heirarchical form.  Major topics include\n      \"comp\"\
    \ for computer topics, \"rec\" for recreational topics, \"soc\"\n      for social\
    \ topics, \"sci\" for science topics, etc.  Within the\n      major topics are\
    \ subtopics, such as \"rec.music.classical\" for\n      classical music, or \"\
    sci.med.physics\" for discussions relating to\n      the physics of medical science.\n\
    \   UUCP (Unix-to-Unix CoPy)\n      This was initially a program run under the\
    \ UNIX operating system\n      that allowed one UNIX system to send files to another\
    \ UNIX system\n      via dial-up phone lines.  Today, the term is more commonly\
    \ used to\n      describe the large international network which uses the UUCP\n\
    \      protocol to pass news and electronic mail.\n   Virus\n      A program which\
    \ replicates itself on computer systems by\n      incorporating itself into other\
    \ programs which are shared among\n      computer systems.\n   WAIS (Wide Area\
    \ Information Server)\n      A distributed information service which offers simple\
    \ natural\n      language input, indexed searching for fast retrieval, and a\n\
    \      \"relevance feedback\" mechanism which allows the results of initial\n\
    \      searches to influence future searches.  Public domain\n      implementations\
    \ are available.\n   WWW (World Wide Web)\n      A hypertext-based, distributed\
    \ information system created by\n      researchers at CERN in Switzerland.  Users\
    \ may create, edit or\n      browse hypertext documents.  The clients and servers\
    \ are freely\n      available.  The WWW servers are interconnected to allow a\
    \ user to\n      traverse the Web from any starting point; in addition, many other\n\
    \      servers such as WAIS and Gopher have been incorporated into the\n     \
    \ WWW servers.\n"
