  - "Abstract\n   This document provides details of the Voice Profile for Internet
    Mail\n   (VPIM) directory service.  The service provides the email address of\n
    \  the recipient that is given a telephone number.  It optionally\n   provides
    the spoken name of the recipient and the media capabilities\n   of the recipient.\n
    \  The VPIM directory Schema provides essential additional attributes to\n   recreate
    the voice mail user experience using standardized\n   directories.  This user
    experience provides, at the time of\n   addressing, basic assurances that the
    message will be delivered as\n   intended.  This document combines two earlier
    documents, one from\n   Anne Brown and one from Greg Vaudreuil, that define a
    voice messaging\n   schema into a single working group submission.\n"

    - "1.1.  Design Goals\n   The VPIM directory Schema (VPIMDIR) is accessed from
      outside the\n   enterprise or service provider domain using the recipient's
      telephone\n   number.\n"
    title: 1.1.  Design Goals
  - contents:
    - "1.2.  Performance Constraints\n   Once the identity of the VPIM directory server
      is known, the email\n   address, capabilities, and spoken name confirmation
      information can\n   be retrieved.  This query is expected to use LDAP [LDAP],
      a\n   connection-oriented protocol.  The protocol transaction includes\n   multiple
      packet round-trips to execute the query and retrieval and is\n   considered
      to be the highest latency element of the messaging\n   service.  Further, retrieval
      of the confirmation information may\n   require the return of a spoken name
      segment of up to 20kbytes (5\n   seconds at 4kbytes/second).  Over a sufficiently
      engineered Internet\n   connection, a 1250 ms response time is believed to be
      achievable over\n   the Internet at large.\n"

    - "1.3.  Scaling Constraints\n   A service provider's namespace is expected to
      include entries for\n   tens of millions of subscribers in a flat namespace
      based on the VPIM\n   inter-domain address form: telephone_number@domain_name.
      \ A large\n   corporation may have a hundred-thousand entries, while a large\n
      \  service provider may have tens of millions of entries in a single\n   domain.
      \ It is expected that there will be a single public address\n   validation service
      for a given service provider's network.  It is\n   believed that existing directory
      technology, including horizontal\n   scalability through replication, will provide
      sufficient transaction\n   throughput within the required latency requirements
      to address this\n   need.  The only fundamental, new requirement this application
      imposes\n   on directory servers, beyond similar existing services, is the\n
      \  ability to return the recipient's spoken name.  Preliminary\n   investigation
      suggests that storage and retrieval of a spoken name\n   will not add appreciable
      latency; however, it will add to the need\n   for storage capacity.\n"

      load-balancing\n   capabilities for the VPIMDIR.  However, the latency requirements
      to\n   the end-user may not permit client-side fail-over to a secondary\n   server
      and may require the directory server to be implemented as a\n   high-availability
      service.\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The following are known security issues.\n   1)
    Service provider customer information is very sensitive,\n      especially in
    this time of local phone competition.  Service\n      providers require maximum
    flexibility to protect this data.\n      Because of the dense nature of telephone
    number assignments, this\n      data is subject to \"go fish\" queries via repeated
    LDAP queries to\n      determine a complete list of current or active messaging\n
    \     subscribers.  To reduce the value of this retrieved data, service\n      providers
    may limit disclosure of data that is useful for\n      telemarketing, such as
    the textual name, and may disclose only\n      information useful to the sender,
    such as the recipient's spoken\n      name, a data element that is much harder
    to auto-process.\n   2) In many countries, there are privacy laws or regulations
    that\n      prohibit disclosure of certain kinds of descriptive information\n
    \     (e.g., text names).  Hence, server implementors are encouraged to\n      support
    DIT structural rules and name forms [LDAPMODELS] as these\n      provide a mechanism
    for administrators to select appropriate\n      naming attributes for entries.
    \ Administrators are encouraged to\n      use these mechanisms, access controls,
    and other administrative\n      controls, which may be available to restrict use
    of attributes\n      containing sensitive information when naming entries.\n   3)
    The LDAP directory service needs to be secured properly for this\n      intended
    use.  [LDAPAUTH] describes a number of considerations\n      that apply in this
    use.  In particular, this service provides\n      unauthenticated, public access
    to directory data, and as such, it\n      is vulnerable to attacks that redirect
    the query to a rogue server\n      and offer malicious data.\n"

  - "Acknowledgements\n   This directory schema builds upon the earlier work of Carl
    Malamud\n   and Marshall Rose in their TPC.INT remote printing experiment and
    the\n   work lead by Anne Brown as part of the EMA voice messaging\n   committee's
    directory effort.  Anne Brown has provided important\n   leadership and was a
    co-author of the original version of this\n   document.\n   Bernhard Elliot, working
    with the TMIA, has provided most of the\n   organizational impetus to get this
    project moving, which was a\n   substantial task given the sometimes slow and
    bureaucratic nature of\n   the voice mail industry and regulatory environment.\n
    \  Thanks to Dave Dudley and the Messaging Alliance (TMA) for their\n   early
    work in pioneering a shared directory service for voice\n   messaging and their
    continuing efforts to apply that work to this\n   effort.\n   Greg White and Jeff
    Bouis, both of Lucent Technologies, provided\n   invaluable assistance in reviewing
    and sanity checking.  Countless\n   errors and inconsistencies were corrected
    with their diligent review.\n   As chairman of the VPIM working group, Glenn Parsons
    has provided\n   essential support over the many years this document has been
    in\n   development.\n"
