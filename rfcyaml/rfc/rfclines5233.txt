Abstract On email systems that allow for 'subaddressing' or 'detailed addressing' (e.g., "ken sieve@example.org"), it is sometimes desirable to make comparisons against these sub parts of addresses.
This document defines an extension to the Sieve Email Filtering Language that allows users to compare against the user and detail sub parts of an address.
Introduction Subaddressing is the practice of augmenting the local part of an [RFC2822] address with some 'detail' information in order to give some extra meaning to that address.
Typical uses of subaddressing might be:  A message addressed to "ken sieve@example.org" is delivered into a mailbox called "sieve" belonging to the user "ken".
A message addressed to "5551212#123@example.com" is delivered to the voice mailbox number "123" at phone number "5551212".
This document describes an extension to the Sieve language defined by [RFC5228] for comparing against the 'user' and 'detail' sub parts of an address.
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The capability string associated with the extension defined in this document is "subaddress".
Subaddress Comparisons Test commands that act exclusively on addresses may take the optional tagged arguments ":user" and ":detail" to specify what sub part of the local part of the address will be acted upon.
In most cases, the envelope "to" address is the preferred address to examine for subaddress information when the desire is to sort messages based on how they were addressed so as to get to a specific recipient.
The envelope address is, after all, the reason a given message is being processed by a given sieve script for a given user.
This is particularly true when mailing lists, aliases, and 'virtual domains' are involved since the envelope may be the only source of detail information for the specific recipient.
Because the encoding of detailed addresses are site and/or implementation specific, using the subaddress extension on foreign addresses (such as the envelope "from" address or originator header fields) may lead to inconsistent or incorrect results.
The ":user" argument specifies the user sub part of the local part of an address.
If the address is not encoded to contain a detail sub  part, then ":user" specifies the entire left side of the address (equivalent to ":localpart").
The ":detail" argument specifies the detail sub part of the local  part of an address.
If the address is not encoded to contain a detail sub part, then the address fails to match any of the specified keys.
If a zero length string is encoded as the detail sub part, then
If the encoding method used for detailed addresses utilizes a separator character sequence, and the separator character sequence occurs more than once in the local part, then the logic used to split the address is implementation defined and is usually dependent on the format used by the encompassing mail system.
Implementations MUST make sure that the encoding method used for detailed addresses matches that which is used and/or allowed by the encompassing mail system, otherwise unexpected results might occur.
Note that the mechanisms used to define and/or query the encoding method used by the mail system are outside the scope of this document.
The ":user" and ":detail" address parts are subject to the same rules and restrictions as the standard address parts defined in [RFC5228], Section 2.7.4.
For convenience, the "ADDRESS PART" syntax element defined in [RFC5228], Section 2.7.4, is augmented here as follows:
# In this example the same user account receives mail for both # "ken@example.com" and "postmaster@example.com"
# File all messages to postmaster into a single mailbox, # ignoring the :detail part.
if envelope :detail "to" "mta filters" { fileinto "inbox.ietf mta filters"; }
# Redirect all mail sent to "ken foo".
The following template specifies the IANA registration of the subaddress Sieve extension specified in this document.
This registration replaces that from RFC 3598: To: iana@iana.org Subject: Registration of new Sieve extension Capability name:
Adds the ':user' and ':detail' address parts for use with the address and envelope tests RFC number:
The Sieve discussion list <ietf mta
This information has been added to the list of Sieve extensions given on http://www.iana.org/assignments/sieve extensions.
Security Considerations Security considerations are discussed in [RFC5228].
It is believed that this extension does not introduce any additional security concerns.
Appendix B.  Changes since RFC 3598  Discussion of how the user and detail information is encoded now uses generic language.
Added note detailing that this extension is most useful when used on the envelope "to" address.
Added note detailing that this extension isn't very useful on foreign addresses (envelope "from" or originator header fields).
Fixed envelope test example to only use "to" address.
:user" example with one that doesn't produce unexpected behavior.
Use only RFC 2606 domains in examples.
