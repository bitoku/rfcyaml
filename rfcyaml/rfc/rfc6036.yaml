  - "1.  Introduction\n   As is well known, the approaching exhaustion of IPv4 address\
    \ space\n   will bring about a situation in which Internet Service Providers\n\
    \   (ISPs) are faced with a choice between one or more of three major\n   alternatives:\n\
    \   1.  Squeeze the use of IPv4 addresses even harder than today, using\n    \
    \   smaller and smaller address blocks per enterprise customer, and\n       possibly\
    \ trading address blocks with other ISPs.\n   2.  Install multiple layers of Network\
    \ Address Translation (NAT)\n       [CGN] or share IPv4 addresses by other methods\
    \ such as address-\n       plus-port mapping [APLUSP], [PRANGE].\n   3.  Deploy\
    \ IPv6 and operate IPv4-IPv6 coexistence and interworking\n       mechanisms.\n\
    \   This document focuses on alternative (3), while recognizing that many\n  \
    \ ISPs may be obliged by circumstances to prolong the life of IPv4 by\n   using\
    \ (1) or (2) while preparing for (3).\n   This document describes IPv6 deployment\
    \ scenarios already adopted or\n   currently planned by a set of ISPs who responded\
    \ to a technical\n   questionnaire.  Thus, it is a factual record of the responses\
    \ from\n   those ISPs.  It makes no recommendations; the best choice of\n   scenarios\
    \ will depend on the circumstances of individual ISPs.\n   We consider various\
    \ aspects of IPv6 deployment: addressing, routing,\n   DNS, management, and IPv4-IPv6\
    \ coexistence and interworking.  We do\n   not consider application services in\
    \ detail, but we do cover general\n   aspects.\n   The reader is assumed to be\
    \ familiar with IPv6.  The IETF's view of\n   core IPv6 requirements is to be\
    \ found in [RFC4294] (currently being\n   updated as [NODEREQ]).  However, this\
    \ does not give a complete view\n   of mechanisms an ISP may need to deploy, since\
    \ it considers the\n   requirements for an individual node, not for a network\
    \ or service\n   infrastructure as a whole.\n   [RFC4029] discusses scenarios\
    \ for introducing IPv6 into ISP networks,\n   as the problem was viewed some years\
    \ ago.  Its end goal is simply a\n   dual-stack ISP backbone.  Today's view is\
    \ that this is insufficient,\n   as it does not allow for interworking between\
    \ IPv6-only and legacy\n   (IPv4-only) hosts.  Indeed, the end goal today might\
    \ be an IPv6-only\n   ISP backbone, with some form of legacy IPv4 support.\n \
    \  [RFC4779] discusses deployment in broadband access networks such as\n   Cable\
    \ Television (CATV), Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL),\n   and wireless.\
    \  [RFC5181], [RFC5121], and [RFC5692] deal specifically\n   with IEEE 802.16\
    \ access networks.  MPLS-based ISPs may use the IPv6\n   Provider Edge Router\
    \ (6PE) [RFC4798] mechanism.\n   [RFC4942] covers IPv6 security issues, especially\
    \ those that are\n   specific to transition and IPv4-IPv6 coexistence scenarios.\n\
    \   [RFC4864] discusses \"Local Network Protection\", i.e., how the\n   internal\
    \ structure of an IPv6 site network can be protected.  This\n   affects how well\
    \ an ISP's customers are protected after they deploy\n   IPv6.\n   Although the\
    \ basic IPv6 standards have long been stable, it should be\n   noted that considerable\
    \ work continues in the IETF, particularly to\n   resolve the issue of highly\
    \ scalable multihoming support for IPv6\n   sites, and to resolve the problem\
    \ of IP layer interworking between\n   IPv6-only and IPv4-only hosts.  IPv6/IPv4\
    \ interworking at the\n   application layers is handled within the original dual-stack\
    \ model of\n   IPv6 deployment: either one end of an application session will\
    \ have\n   dual-stack connectivity, or a dual-stack intermediary such as an HTTP\n\
    \   proxy or SMTP server will interface to both IPv4-only and IPv6-only\n   hosts\
    \ or applications.\n   [RFC5211] describes an independent view of a possible sequence\
    \ of\n   events for IPv6 adoption in the Internet as a whole, with direct\n  \
    \ implications for ISPs.  Its main point, perhaps, is that by the year\n   2012,\
    \ it will be appropriate to regard IPv4 networks as the legacy\n   solution.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Methodology
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Methodology\n   To obtain a view of the IPv6 experience, plans, and requirements\
    \ of\n   ISPs, a questionnaire was issued by the authors in December 2009 and\n\
    \   announced widely to the operational community.  We promised to keep\n   the\
    \ replies strictly confidential and to publish only combined\n   results, without\
    \ identifying information about individual ISPs in any\n   published results.\
    \  The raw technical questions are shown in\n   Appendix B, and a detailed summary\
    \ of the replies is in Appendix A.\n   Note that although the questionnaire was\
    \ widely announced, those who\n   chose to reply were self-selected and we can\
    \ make no claim of\n   statistical significance or freedom from bias in the results.\
    \  In\n   particular, we assume that ISPs with a pre-existing interest in IPv6\n\
    \   are more likely to have replied than others.  The results should\n   therefore\
    \ be interpreted with some care.\n"
- title: 2.2.  General Questions about IP Service
  contents:
  - "2.2.  General Questions about IP Service\n   Thirty-one ISPs replied before the\
    \ cutoff date for this analysis. 65%\n   of responses were from European ISPs\
    \ but large operators in North\n   America and Asian/Pacific regions are included.\
    \  Commercial ISPs\n   operating nationally predominate, with a vast range of\
    \ size (from 30\n   customers up to 40 million).  Note that some providers chose\
    \ not to\n   answer about the exact number of customers.  Nevertheless, it can\
    \ be\n   stated that 6 providers each had millions of customers, the next 10\n\
    \   each had more than 10,000 customers, and the remaining 15 each had\n   fewer\
    \ than 10,000 customers.\n   80% of the respondents offer both transit and origin-only\
    \ service;\n   29% offer IP multicast service; 80% have multihomed customers.\n\
    \   A very wide variety of access technologies is used: xDSL, Data Over\n   Cable\
    \ Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS), leased line (X.25,\n   Time Division\
    \ Multiplexer / Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (TDM/\n   PDH), Synchronous Digital\
    \ Hierarchy (SDH)), ATM, frame relay, dialup,\n   microwave, Fiber To The Premises\
    \ (FTTP), CDMA, Universal Mobile\n   Telecommunications System (UMTS), Long Term\
    \ Evolution (LTE),\n   Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX),\
    \ Broadband\n   Wireless Access (BWA), WiFi, Ethernet (100M-10G), Ethernet/SDH,\n\
    \   MetroEthernet/MPLS.  Most ISPs provide Customer Premises Equipment\n   (CPE)\
    \ to some or all of their customers, but these CPE are often\n   unable to support\
    \ IPv6.\n   Estimates of when ISPs will run out of public IPv4 address space for\n\
    \   internal use vary widely, between \"now\" and \"never\".  Public IPv4\n  \
    \ address space for customers is mainly expected to run out between\n   2010 and\
    \ 2015, but four or five ISPs suggested it will never happen,\n   or at least\
    \ not in the foreseeable future.  About 19% of ISPs offer\n   RFC 1918 space to\
    \ customers, and about 39% use such addresses\n   internally.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Requirements for IPv6 Service
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Requirements for IPv6 Service\n   61% of ISPs report that some big customers\
    \ are requesting IPv6.\n   Predictions for when 10% of customers will require\
    \ IPv6 range from\n   2010 to 2017, and for 50% from 2011 to 2020.  These ISPs\
    \ require IPv6\n   to be a standard service by 2010 to 2015; the most common target\
    \ date\n   is 2011.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Status and Plans for IPv6 Service
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Status and Plans for IPv6 Service\n   42% of ISPs already offer IPv6 as\
    \ a regular service, although, in\n   general, it is used by fewer than 1% of\
    \ customers.  Another 48% of\n   ISPs have IPv6 deployment in progress or planned.\
    \  These all plan at\n   least beta-test service in 2010.  Planned dates for regular\
    \ service\n   are between 2010 and 2013 (except for one ISP who replied that it\n\
    \   depends on the marketing department).  When asked when IPv6 will\n   reach\
    \ 50% of total traffic, the most common answer is 2015.\n"
- title: 2.5.  IPv6 Technologies
  contents:
  - "2.5.  IPv6 Technologies\n   Turning to technology choices, the overwhelming choice\
    \ of approach\n   (94%) is a dual-stack routing backbone, and the reason given\
    \ is\n   simplicity and cost. 39% run, or plan to run, a 6to4 relay as well,\n\
    \   and 16% run or plan a Teredo server.  However, 77% of ISPs don't have\n  \
    \ or plan to have any devices dedicated to IPv6.  A different 77% don't\n   see\
    \ IPv6 as an opportunity to restructure their network topology.\n   When asked\
    \ which types of equipment are unable to support IPv6, the\n   most common answer\
    \ was CPE (10 mentions).  Also mentioned: handsets;\n   Digital Subscriber Line\
    \ Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs); routers\n   (including several specific models);\
    \ traffic management boxes; load\n   balancers; VPN boxes; some SIP platforms;\
    \ management interfaces &\n   systems; firewalls; billing systems.  When asked\
    \ if such devices can\n   be field-upgraded, the answers were gloomy: 5 yes, 4\
    \ partially, 10\n   no, and numerous \"don't know\" or \"hopefully\".\n   84%\
    \ support or plan DNS Authentication, Authorization, Accounting,\n   and Auditing\
    \ (AAAA) queries over IPv6, and all but one of these\n   include reverse DNS lookup\
    \ for IPv6.\n   The ISPs surveyed have prefixes ranging from /19 to /48, and have\
    \ a\n   variety of policies for customer prefixes.  Fifteen ISPs offer more\n\
    \   than one of /48, /52, /56, /60, or /64.  Two offer /56 only, eight\n   offer\
    \ /48 only.  Two wired operators offer /64 only.  Mobile\n   operators offer /64\
    \ in accordance with 3GPP, but at least one would\n   like to be allowed to offer\
    \ /128 or /126.  Also, as many as 30% of\n   the operators already have IPv6 customers\
    \ preferring a PI (provider\n   independent) prefix.  The methods chosen for prefix\
    \ delegation to\n   CPEs are manual, DHCPv6[-PD], Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\n\
    \   (SLAAC), RADIUS, and Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE).\n   However,\
    \ in fact, the latter two cannot assign a prefix on their own.\n   About 50% of\
    \ ISPs already operate or plan dual-stack SMTP, Post\n   Office Protocol 3 (POP3),\
    \ IMAP, and HTTP services.  In terms of\n   internal services, it seems that firewalls,\
    \ intrusion detection,\n   address management, monitoring, and network management\
    \ tools are also\n   around the 50% mark.  However, accounting and billing software\
    \ is\n   only ready at 23% of ISPs.\n   Considering IPv4-IPv6 interworking, 58%\
    \ of ISPs don't expect to have\n   IPv6-only customers (but mobile operators are\
    \ certain they will have\n   millions).  Five ISPs report customers who explicitly\
    \ refused to\n   consider IPv6.  When asked how long customers will run IPv4-only\n\
    \   applications, the most frequent answer is \"more than ten years\".\n   Only\
    \ three ISPs state that IPv6-IPv4 interworking at the IP layer is\n   not needed.\
    \  On the other hand, only three (a different three!) run\n   or plan to run NAT-PT\
    \ (Protocol Translation).  At least 30% plan to\n   run some kind of translator\
    \ (presumably NAT64/DNS64), but only two\n   felt that a multicast translator\
    \ was essential.  Among those who do\n   not plan a translator, when asked how\
    \ they plan to connect IPv6-only\n   customers to IPv4-only services, seven rely\
    \ on dual stack and four\n   have no plan (one said, paraphrasing, \"it's their\
    \ problem\").\n   Asked about plans for Mobile IPv6 (or Nemo mobile networks),\
    \ 19% said\n   yes, and 71% said no, with the others uncertain.  A detailed analysis\n\
    \   shows that of the six ISPs who responded positively, three are large\n   mobile\
    \ operators (and a fourth mobile operator said no).  The other\n   three who responded\
    \ positively were broadband ISPs ranging from small\n   to very large.\n"

  - "2.6.  Effect of Size\n   We examined the data to see whether any other differences\
    \ would\n   emerge between the very large (millions of customers), medium (at\n\
    \   least 10,000), and small (fewer than 10,000) operators.  However, the\n  \
    \ range of answers seems to be broadly similar in all cases.  The major\n   exception\
    \ is that among the six very large operators, one plans to\n   use 6PE and dual-stack\
    \ lite (DS-lite), and another to use IPv6 on VPN\n   to Provider Edge Router (6VPE),\
    \ instead of a simple dual stack.  The\n   other large operators and all the medium\
    \ and small operators prefer a\n   simple dual stack.\n"
- title: 3.  Lessons from Experience and Planning
  contents:
  - "3.  Lessons from Experience and Planning\n   This section is assembled and paraphrased\
    \ from general comments made\n   in the various questionnaire responses.  Any\
    \ inconsistencies or\n   contradictions are present in the original data.  Comments\
    \ related to\n   missing features and products have been included in Section 4.\n\
    \   As noted in the summary above, the ISPs that responded overwhelmingly\n  \
    \ prefer a native dual-stack deployment.  Numerous comments mentioned\n   the\
    \ simplicity of this model and the complexity and sub-optimal\n   routing of tunnel-based\
    \ solutions.  Topology redesign is not\n   generally considered desirable, because\
    \ congruent IPv4 and IPv6\n   topology simplifies maintenance and engineering.\
    \  Nevertheless, 6to4\n   is considered convenient for cable modem (DOCSIS) users\
    \ and IPv6\n   Rapid Deployment (6RD) is considered an attractive model by some.\n\
    \   Various operators, but by no means all, also see a need for Teredo.\n   One\
    \ very large MPLS-based operator prefers 6PE because it avoids an\n   IPv6 IGP\
    \ and reduces operational costs.  This operator also sees IPv4\n   scarcity addressed\
    \ by DS-lite [DSLITE] and Carrier Grade NAT, also\n   acting as a catalyst for\
    \ IPv6.  Another very large operator with an\n   existing NAT44 infrastructure\
    \ plans to use 6VPE [RFC4659] and\n   believes that NAT64 will be similar to NAT44\
    \ in support requirements.\n   Several ISPs observe that IPv6 deployment is technically\
    \ not hard.\n   The most eloquent statement: \"Just do it, bit by bit.  It is\
    \ very\n   much an 'eating the elephant' problem, but at one mouthful at a time,\n\
    \   it appears to be surprisingly easy.\"  Other comments paraphrased from\n \
    \  the replies are:\n   o  Despite the known gaps, the tools and toolkits are\
    \ fairly mature\n      at this point.\n   o  Managerial commitment and a systematic\
    \ approach to analyzing\n      requirements and readiness are essential.\n   o\
    \  Evangelization remains a must, as it seems that many ISP and IT\n      managers\
    \ are still unaware of the need for an IPv6 plan, and are\n      inclined to dismiss\
    \ IPv4 depletion as a false alarm, and also seem\n      unaware that NATs create\
    \ expensive support requirements.\n   o  Without customers wanting IPv6, getting\
    \ business backing is very\n      hard, and IPv6 security and scale was not a\
    \ focus for vendors\n      until very recently.\n   o  Operators lack real experience\
    \ with customer usage of IPv6, and\n      the resulting lack of confidence causes\
    \ delay.\n   Three further quotations are of interest:\n   \"We are planning to\
    \ move all our management addressing from IPv4 to\n   IPv6 to free up IPv4 addresses.\"\
    \n   \"I am actively pushing our larger customers to start testing IPv6 as\n \
    \  our development has pretty much stopped as we need some real world\n   testing\
    \ to be done.\"\n   \"Customer support needs to be aware that IPv6 is being started\
    \ in\n   your network, or servers.  We experienced many IPv6 blocking\n   applications,\
    \ applications that do not fall back to IPv4, etc.  The\n   most difficult part\
    \ may be to get engineers, sales, customer support\n   personnel to like IPv6.\"\

- title: 4.1.  Product Issues
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Product Issues\n   As noted above, numerous models of various types of\
    \ product still do\n   not support IPv6:\n   o  CPE\n   o  Handsets\n   o  DSLAMs\n\
    \   o  Routers\n   o  Traffic management boxes\n   o  Load balancers\n   o  VPN\

    \ systems\n   o  Accounting and billing systems\n   It is not the purpose of this\
    \ document to name and shame vendors, but\n   today it is becoming urgent for\
    \ all products to avoid becoming part\n   of the IPv4 legacy.  ISPs stated that\
    \ they want consistent feature-\n   equivalent support for IPv4 and IPv6 in all\
    \ equipment and software at\n   reasonable or no extra cost.  The problems can\
    \ be quite subtle: for\n   example, one CPE with \"full\" IPv6 support does not\
    \ support IPv6\n   traffic shaping, so the ISP cannot cap IPv6 traffic to contractual\n\
    \   limits.\n   Numerous ISPs want a scalable NAT64/DNS64 product.\n   The need\
    \ for IPv6 support in \"all the best open source tools\" was\n   also mentioned.\n\
    \   Several ISPs also noted that much commercial applications software\n   does\
    \ not correctly support IPv6 and that this will cause customer\n   problems. \
    \ Also, some operating systems are still shipped with IPv6\n   disabled by default\
    \ or with features such as IPv4-mapped addresses\n   disabled by default.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Protocol Issues
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Protocol Issues\n   Various needs and issues related mainly to protocols\

  - "4.3.  Documentation and General Issues\n   We also note areas where there was\
    \ clearly confusion among the ISPs\n   responding, which may denote weaknesses\
    \ of existing documentation:\n   o  Perhaps due to poor phrasing in the survey\
    \ questions, some ISPs\n      indicated that they would use PPPoE or RADIUS to\
    \ assign prefixes\n      to CPEs.  In fact, IPv6 PPP only negotiates 64-bit interface\n\
    \      identifiers; a full address has to be assigned by another method,\n   \
    \   and even this does not delegate a prefix to a CPE router.  RADIUS\n      alone\
    \ is also insufficient, as it needs to be combined with\n      another method\
    \ for full address assignment.\n   o  Although most ISPs see a need for IPv4-IPv6\
    \ interworking at the\n      network layer, many of them do not see a need for\
    \ an ISP to\n      operate the resulting translator.  Yet, their customers, whether\n\
    \      subscribers or content providers, will be the first to suffer when\n  \
    \    IPv6-only clients cannot reach IPv4-only services.\n   o  Most ISPs seemed\
    \ to misunderstand the nature of a tunnel broker,\n      even though this is a\
    \ service that any ISP could consider offering\n      to its subscribers.\n  \
    \ Global IPv6 connectivity still has issues; for example, ISPs in the\n   Pacific\
    \ region may have to obtain IPv6 transit via the USA (a\n   situation faced by\
    \ IPv4 operators in Europe about twenty years ago).\n   Also, there are persistent\
    \ Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) issues in\n   various places on the net, and a lack\
    \ of multicast peering.\n   Finally, there was a comment that real deployment\
    \ case studies must\n   be shown to operators along with multihoming and traffic\
    \ engineering\n   best practices.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   As a report on a survey, this document creates\
    \ no security issues in\n   itself.  ISPs did not register any general concerns\
    \ about IPv6\n   security.  However, we note that about half of all firewall and\n\
    \   intrusion detection products are still reported not to support IPv6.\n   Some\
    \ ISPs expressed concern about firewall performance and about the\n   need for\
    \ separate firewall configurations for IPv4 and IPv6.\n"

    \ network are unable to support\n        IPv6?\n        17.1.  Can they be field-upgraded\
    \ to support IPv6?\n        17.2.  Is any equipment 100% dedicated to IPv6?\n\
    \   18.  Is IPv6 an opportunity to restructure your whole topology?\n   19.  Do\
    \ you include support for DNS AAAA queries over IPv6?\n   20.  Do you include\
    \ support for reverse DNS for IPv6 addresses?\n   21.  What length(s) of IPv6\
    \ prefix do you have or need from the\n        registry?\n   22.  What length(s)\
    \ of IPv6 prefix are offered to customers?\n        22.1.  Do any customers share\
    \ their IPv6 prefix among multiple\n           hosts?\n   23.  Do any of your\
    \ customers prefer to use PI IPv6 prefixes instead\n        of a prefix from you?\n\
    \   24.  How are IPv6 prefixes delegated to CPEs?  (Manual, PPPoE,\n        RADIUS,\
    \ DHCPv6, stateless autoconfiguration/RA, etc...)\n   25.  Are your SMTP, POP3\
    \ and IMAP services dual-stack?\n   26.  Are your HTTP services, including caching\
    \ and webmail, dual-\n        stack?\n   27.  Are any other services dual-stack?\n\
    \   28.  Is each of the following dual-stack?\n        28.1.  Firewalls\n    \
    \    28.2.  Intrusion detection\n        28.3.  Address management software\n\
    \        28.4.  Accounting software\n        28.5.  Monitoring software\n    \
    \    28.6.  Network management tools\n   29.  Do you or will you have IPv6-only\
    \ customers?\n   30.  Do you have customers who have explicitly refused to consider\n\
    \        IPv6?\n   31.  How many years do you expect customers to run any IPv4-only\n\
    \        applications?\n   32.  Is IPv6-IPv4 interworking at the IP layer needed?\n\
    \   33.  Do you include a NAT-PT IPv6/IPv4 translator?\n        33.1.  If yes,\
    \ does that include DNS translation?\n        33.2.  If not, do you plan to operate\
    \ an IPv6/IPv4 translator?\n        33.3.  If not, how do you plan to connect\
    \ IPv6-only customers to\n           IPv4-only services?\n        33.4.  If you\
    \ offer IP multicast, will that need to be\n           translated too?\n   34.\
    \  Any plans for Mobile IPv6 (or Nemo mobile networks)?\n   35.  What features\
    \ and tools are missing today for IPv6 deployment\n        and operations?\n \
    \  36.  Any other comments about your IPv6 experience or plans?  What\n      \
    \  went well, what was difficult, etc.\n"
