  - "                          NETWORK HOST STATUS\n   This RFC reports on the status\
    \ of most Network Hosts from\n   May 8 to May 19.  No testing was done on May\
    \ 15 due to the attempt\n   to install the new IMP system on that day.\n   During\
    \ this interval the PDP-10 of the MIT Artificial\n   Intelligence Group (Network\
    \ address 134) and the PDP-10 at\n   Stanford (Network address 11) each became\
    \ Network Servers.\n   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.\n\
    \   These Hosts fall into two categories:\n        1)  Hosts which are not expected\
    \ to be functioning on the\n            Network as servers (available for use\
    \ from other sites)\n            on a regular basis for at least two weeks.  The\
    \ only\n            Host in this category is the PDP-10 at Case (Network\n   \
    \         address 13).\n        2)  Hosts which are currently intended to be users\
    \ only.\n            Included here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently\n\
    \            in the Network (AMES, MITRE, NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, and\n         \
    \   BBN*).  This category also includes the Network Control\n            Center\
    \ computer (Network address 5) which is used solely\n            for gathering\
    \ statistics from the Network.  Finally,\n            included among these Hosts\
    \ are the following:\n            Network\n            Address              Site\
    \                   Computer\n               7                Rand           \

    \          19                NBS                     PDP-11\n              23\
    \                USC                     IBM-360/44\n   The tables on the next\
    \ two pages summarize the Host status\n   for this period.\n   _____________\n\
    \   *The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\n   such\
    \ is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used\n   to refine and\
    \ debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n"
