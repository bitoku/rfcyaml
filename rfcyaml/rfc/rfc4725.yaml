- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) [1] uses the Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS) [4]\n   to refer from E.164 numbers [2] to Uniform Resource Identifiers\n\
    \   (URIs) [3].  E.164 numbers are mapped to domain names through means\n   described\
    \ further in RFC 3761 [1].\n   \"Ordinary\" domain names are usually allocated\
    \ on a first-come-first-\n   served basis, where the associated registration data\
    \ is the complete\n   source of ownership.  However, ENUM domain names are linked\
    \ to E.164\n   numbers, and thus intrinsically tied to the status and the \"Assignee\"\
    \n   (defined in Section 3.2) of the corresponding E.164 number.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements\n   Preserving integrity between ENUM and E.164 is one of the\
    \ main\n   concerns in ENUM implementations, and often one of the reasons why\n\
    \   \"trials\" precede commercial implementations.\n   To maintain this relationship\
    \ between E.164 numbers and ENUM domain\n   names, registration processes must\
    \ ensure that the following\n   requirements are fulfilled during the entire lifetime\
    \ of an ENUM\n   delegation:\n   o  The ENUM domain name corresponds either to\
    \ an assigned E.164\n      number or to a respective E.164 number that is assigned\
    \ during the\n      registration process itself.\n   o  The corresponding E.164\
    \ number is within a number range approved\n      to be used with ENUM.\n   o\
    \  The registration of the ENUM domain name is authorized by the\n      Assignee\
    \ of the corresponding E.164 number; i.e., the entity\n      requesting the registration\
    \ of an ENUM domain name is either the\n      Assignee of the corresponding E.164\
    \ number itself or an entity\n      authorized to request registration on behalf\
    \ of said Assignee.\n   o  The \"Registrant\" (see Section 3.3) of the ENUM domain\
    \ is identical\n      to the Assignee of the corresponding E.164 number.\n   The\
    \ process of verifying the above requirements during registration\n   is commonly\
    \ called \"initial validation\".  In addition to this one-\n   time validation\
    \ process, provisions must be made that ENUM domain\n   name delegations are revoked\
    \ when the above requirements are no\n   longer met.  In other words, it must\
    \ be ensured that the state of the\n   ENUM domain name tracks any change in state\
    \ and ownership of the\n   corresponding E.164 number.  The regular process of\
    \ checking that the\n   above requirements are still satisfied is commonly called\
    \ \"recurring\n   validation\" or \"revalidation\".\n   The above requirements\
    \ are usually part of the local registration\n   policy issued by the authorities\
    \ in charge of ENUM administration.\n"

    \ introduction of a new role in the\n   provisioning model, an entity performing\

- title: 3.1.  Number Assignment Entity (NAE)
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Number Assignment Entity (NAE)\n   A Number Assignment Entity (NAE) assigns\
    \ E.164 numbers to end-users.\n   Often, but not always, the Communication Service\
    \ Provider (CSP) of\n   the end-user (Assignee) acts as NAE.  There are two main\
    \ variants for\n   E.164 number assignments:\n   1.  Indirect assignment:\n  \
    \     The National Number Plan Administrator (NNPA) assigns ranges of\n      \
    \ E.164 numbers to CSPs.  Out of these ranges, the CSPs assign\n       numbers\
    \ (or number blocks) to their customers (end-users,\n       Assignees).  In this\
    \ variant, the CSPs perform the role of the\n       NAE.\n   2.  Direct assignment:\n\
    \       In certain cases, an NNPA assigns E.164 numbers directly to\n       Assignees\
    \ (end-users), and therefore the NNPA acts as NAE in this\n       variant.  Typically,\
    \ this concerns the assignment of special\n       purpose numbers (e.g., premium\
    \ rate).\n   These two variants of E.164 number assignment are depicted in\n \

    \ an E.164 number is\n   the primary source of number assignment information,\
    \ the NAE usually\n   holds the authoritative information required to confirm\
    \ the\n   assignment.\n   A CSP that acts as NAE (indirect assignment) may therefore\
    \ easily\n   assert the E.164 number assignment for its subscribers.  In some\n\
    \   cases, such CSPs operate database(s) containing service information\n   on\
    \ their subscribers' numbers.  Typically, authorized entities such\n   as other\
    \ CSPs are allowed to access these databases, in real-time,\n   under contract\
    \ for the limited purposes of billing and validation (no\n   marketing, data mining,\
    \ or otherwise).  These databases could be re-\n   used for ENUM validation purposes.\n\
    \   Number portability transactions may lead to situations where the CSP\n   that\
    \ originally acted as NAE no longer has authoritative assignment\n   information\
    \ about ported numbers.  Whether the old and/or the new CSP\n   act(s) as NAE\
    \ for ported numbers depends on local policy.\n   However, it is unlikely that\
    \ all CSPs acting as NAEs will participate\n   in ENUM validation.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Workflow
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Workflow\n   The prototypical initial validation workflow using the above\
    \ roles\n   and definitions consists of the following steps:\n   1.  A potential\
    \ Registrant approaches a Registrar, and orders an ENUM\n       domain name.\n\
    \   2.  The Registrar chooses a cooperating Validation Entity, and\n       requests\
    \ an initial validation for the ENUM domain name ordered.\n   3.  The Validation\
    \ Entity performs the actual validation, which could\n       require interaction\
    \ with the Assignee/Registrant.\n   4.  The Validation Entity indicates the result\
    \ of the initial\n       validation to the Registrar.\n   5.  If the validation\
    \ process was successful, the Registrar\n       provisions the ENUM domain name\
    \ with the Registry.  Depending on\n       the local Registry policy, validation-related\
    \ information may be\n       provided to the Registry along with this registration.\n\
    \   In most cases, local policy mandates expiration dates to be imposed\n   on\
    \ successful validations.  If the ENUM delegation is to be kept\n   beyond this\
    \ expiration date, recurring validation has to be\n   performed.  A typical revalidation\
    \ workflow involves the following\n   steps:\n   1.  In good time before the current\
    \ validation expires, the Registrar\n       requests the Validation Entity to\
    \ revalidate the domain name in\n       question.\n   2.  The Validation Entity\
    \ verifies if the delegation requirements are\n       still met.  It may use information\
    \ acquired during the initial\n       validation or associated to the registration\
    \ data.\n   3.  The Validation Entity indicates the result of the recurring\n\
    \       validation to the Registrar.\n   4.  In case the revalidation has been\
    \ successful, the domain\n       delegation may persist.  Local Registry policy\
    \ may require\n       updating domain name registration data, especially in case\
    \ the\n       Registry keeps validation-related expiry information.\n   5.  In\
    \ case the revalidation has failed, the ENUM domain delegation\n       must be\
    \ suspended, either by explicit interaction with the\n       Registry or -- if\
    \ the Registry keeps validation-related\n       information -- automatically when\
    \ the current validation expires.\n       Local policy may grant a grace period\
    \ on the expiration date.\n   This workflow ensures the integrity between the\
    \ E.164 and ENUM\n   namespaces.  ENUM domain delegations that fail to meet the\
    \ validation\n   requirements are suspended from the DNS.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Trust Relations
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Trust Relations\n   The above validation workflow implies the following\
    \ trust relations:\n   o  The Registry trusts the Validation Entities to enforce\
    \ the local\n      validation policy.\n   o  The Registrars trust the Validation\
    \ Entities to properly perform\n      validation based on the Registrar's request.\n\
    \   o  Depending on the amount of validation data provided to the\n      Registry\
    \ additional trust relations may be necessary.  Three cases\n      can be differentiated:\n\
    \      *  The Registry receives no validation-related data: The Registry\n   \
    \      needs to trust the Registrar that validation has been\n         performed,\
    \ and the result was positive.  In addition, the\n         Registry needs to trust\
    \ the Registrar that it will properly\n         remove delegations for which revalidation\
    \ fails.\n      *  The Registry receives validation-related data including expiry\n\
    \         date, but there are no means of checking its authenticity: The\n   \
    \      Registry needs to trust the Registrar that the validation data\n      \
    \   provided is authentic.\n      *  The Registry receives validation-related\
    \ data including expiry\n         date and means to verify its authenticity (e.g.,\
    \ a\n         cryptographic signature issued by the VE): No additional trust\n\
    \         relations are necessary.\n"

    \ are out of scope\n   of this document):\n   o  Registrars communicate with Validation\
    \ Entities to initiate,\n      modify, or cancel validation requests.  Validation\
    \ Entities act\n      upon validation requests and provide validation results\
    \ to\n      Registrars.  Since Registrars could potentially communicate with\n\
    \      several Validation Entities, and Validation Entities could provide\n  \
    \    services to several Registrars (worst case: full mesh), a\n      standardized\
    \ protocol and data format should be used in this data\n      flow.\n   o  If\
    \ the local Registry policy mandates that validation-related\n      information\
    \ is to be stored along with delegation records, a\n      validation-related data\
    \ flow between Registry and Registrar is\n      required.  Since the registration\
    \ itself already requires\n      communication between those entities, validation-related\n\
    \      information in a standardized data format should be embedded into\n   \
    \   the existing Registry-Registrar protocol data flow.\n   o  Validation Entities\
    \ may need to communicate with Assignees to\n      perform validation.  A Validation\
    \ Entity may choose to perform all\n      communication with the Assignee via\
    \ the requesting Registrar\n      rather than contacting the Assignee by itself.\
    \  Since the actual\n      communication form and process are expected to greatly\
    \ vary, it\n      does not make sense to specify any data formats or processes\
    \ for\n      this purpose.\n"

    \ scenario, we assume that the roles of the Registrar,\n   the VE, and the NAE\
    \ are performed by the same entity, e.g., an\n   Internet Telephony Service Provider\
    \ (ITSP).  This ITSP is a CSP that\n   was assigned number ranges by the NNPA.\
    \  Out of these ranges he\n   assigns numbers to his customers (Assignees) to\
    \ provide those with\n   communication services.  The ITSP chooses to assign an\
    \ E.164 number\n   together with the corresponding ENUM domain name.  Therefore,\
    \ it can\n   perform the validation simply by reference to its subscriber\n  \

    \ and\n        asks the Assignee to confirm his intention.\n   (7)  The Assignee\
    \ confirms and the VE documents this confirmation.\n   (8)  The VE returns a positive\
    \ answer to the Registrar.  The answer\n        might contain some additional\
    \ information about the validation\n        process, such as expiration date,\
    \ validation method applied, and\n        so on.\n   (9)  Finally, the Registrar\
    \ sends an ENUM registration request to the\n        Registry.  Additional information\
    \ about the validation process\n        might be sent along with the registration\
    \ request.\n"

  - "6.1.  Fraud Prevention\n   Situations where an entity has control over the ENUM\
    \ domain of a\n   third party's E.164 number impose high fraud potential.  Unauthorized\n\
    \   control over an ENUM domain of a bank could, for example, be used for\n  \
