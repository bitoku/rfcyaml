Abstract This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB).
It defines the MIB for monitoring Directory System Agents (DSA), a component of the OSI Directory.
This MIB will be used in conjunction with the APPLICATION MIB for monitoring DSAs.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
The major components of the SNMPv2 Network Management framework  are described in the documents listed below.
RFC 1442 [1] defines the Structure of Management Information (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
[2] defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects (MO) for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1445 [3] defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the management framework.
RFC 1448 [4] defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The framework is adaptable/extensible by defining new MIBs to suit the requirements of specific applications/protocols/situations.
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, the MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which is an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, often a textual string, termed the descriptor, is used to refer to the object type.
MIB Model for DSA Management A DSA manager may wish to monitor several aspects of the operational DSA.
He/she may want to know the process related aspects
the resource utilization of the operational DSA; the network service related aspects e.g., inbound associations, outbound associations, operational status, and finally the information specific to the DSA application its operations and performance.
The MIB defined in this document covers the portion which is specific to the DSA application.
The network service related part of the MIB, and the host resources related part of the MIB, as well other parts of interest to a Manager monitoring the DSA application, are covered in separate documents [6]
The DSA functions and operations
The Directory System Agent [DSA], a component of the OSI Directory [5] [9], is an application process.
It provides access to the Directory Information Base [DIB] to Directory User Agents [DUA] and/or other DSAs.
Functionally , a User [DUA] and the Directory are bound together for a period of time at an access point to the Directory [DSA].
A DSA may use information stored in its local database or interact with (chain the request to) other DSAs to service requirements.
Alternatively, a DSA may return a reference to another DSA.
The local database of a DSA consists of the part of the DIT that is mastered by the DSA, the part of the DIT for which it keeps slave copies and cached information that is gathered during the operation of the DSA.
The specific operations carried out by the DSA are: Read, Compare, AddEntry, ModifyEntry, ModifyRDN, RemoveEntry, List, Search.
There is also the special operation Abandon.
In response to requests results and/or errors are returned by the DSA.
The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as possible.
The Managed objects included in the MIB are divided into three tables dsaOpsTable, dsaEntryTable and dsaIntTable.
The dsaOpsTable provides summary statistics on the accesses, operations and errors.
The dsaEntriesTable provides summary statistics on the entries held by the DSA and on cache performance.
The dsaIntTable provides some useful information on the interaction of the monitored DSA with peer DSAs.
There are references to the Directory itself for static information pertaining to the DSA.
These references are in the form of "Directory Distinguished Name" [8] of the corresponding object.
It is intended that DSA management applications will use these references to obtain further related information on the objects of interest.
