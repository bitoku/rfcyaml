Abstract This document defines the 'application/gzip' and 'application/zlib' media types for compressed data using the gzip and zlib compression formats.
Introduction zlib [RFC1950] and gzip [RFC1952] are widely used compression formats.
zlib is a stream format, while gzip adds header and trailer fields more appropriate for a file format.
Both implement the DEFLATE compression scheme described in [RFC1951].
They are used to compress a wide variety of material, from unstructured text to structured data to executable code.
Some applications have informally used media types such as application/gzip compressed, application/gzipped, application/ x gunzip, application/
x gzip, application/x gzip compressed, and gzip/document to describe data compressed with gzip.
The media types defined in this document should replace those media types in future applications.
The 'application/zlib' media type describes a block of data that is compressed using zlib [RFC1950] compression.
The data is a stream of bytes as described in RFC 1950.

Interoperability considerations: N/A Published specification: [RFC1950]
Applications that use this media type: anywhere data size is an issue Additional information: Magic number(s): first byte is usually 0x78 but can also be 0x08, 0x18, 0x28, 0x38, 0x48, 0x58, or 0x68.
The first two bytes, when interpreted as an unsigned 16 bit number in big endian byte order, contain a value that is a multiple of 31.

The 'application/gzip' media type describes a block of data that is compressed using gzip [RFC1952] compression.
The data is a stream of bytes as described in RFC 1952.

Security Considerations zlib and gzip compression can be used to compress arbitrary binary data such as hostile executable code.
Also, data that purports to be in zlib or gzip format may not be, and fields that are supposed to be flags, lengths, or pointers could contain anything.
Applications should treat any data with due skepticism.
Also see the security considerations in the underlying format documents:
Section 5 of [RFC1950], Section 6 of [RFC1951], and Section 4 of [RFC1952].
IANA Considerations IANA has updated the "Application Media Types" registry to include 'application/zlib' as described in Section 2 and 'application/gzip' as described in Section 3.
