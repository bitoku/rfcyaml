- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4787], [RFC5382], and [RFC5508] contributed to enhance\
    \ Network\n   Address Translation (NAT) interoperability and conformance.\n  \
    \ Operational experience gained through widespread deployment and\n   evolution\
    \ of NAT indicates that some areas of the original documents\n   need further\
    \ clarification or updates.  This document provides such\n   clarifications and\
    \ updates.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope\n   The goal of this document is to clarify and update the set of\n\
    \   requirements listed in [RFC4787], [RFC5382], and [RFC5508].  The\n   document\
    \ focuses exclusively on NAT44.\n   The scope of this document has been set so\
    \ that it does not create\n   new requirements beyond those specified in the documents\
    \ cited above.\n   Requirements related to Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) are defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC6888].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC2119].\n   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC2663], [RFC4787], [RFC5382], and [RFC5508].\n   In this document,\
    \ the term \"NAT\" refers to both \"Basic NAT\" and\n   \"Network Address/Port\
    \ Translator (NAPT)\" (see Section 3 of\n   [RFC4787]).  As a reminder, Basic\
    \ NAT and NAPT are two variations of\n   traditional NAT in that translation in\
    \ Basic NAT is limited to IP\n   addresses alone, whereas translation in NAPT\
    \ is extended to include\n   IP addresses and transport identifiers (such as a\
    \ TCP/UDP port or\n   ICMP query ID); refer to Section 2 of [RFC3022].\n"

- title: 2.1.  TCP Transitory Connection Idle-Timeout
  contents:
  - "2.1.  TCP Transitory Connection Idle-Timeout\n   The transitory connection idle-timeout\
    \ is defined as the minimum time\n   a TCP connection in the partially open or\
    \ closing phases must remain\n   idle before the NAT considers the associated\
    \ session a candidate for\n   removal (REQ-5 of [RFC5382]).  However, [RFC5382]\
    \ does not clearly\n   state whether these can be configured separately.\n   Clarification:\
    \  This document clarifies that a NAT SHOULD provide\n      different configurable\
    \ parameters for configuring the open and\n      closing idle timeouts.\n    \
    \  To accommodate deployments that consider a partially open timeout\n      of\
    \ 4 minutes as being excessive from a security standpoint, a NAT\n      MAY allow\
    \ the configured timeout to be less than 4 minutes.\n      However, a minimum\
    \ default transitory connection idle-timeout of 4\n      minutes is RECOMMENDED.\n"
- title: 2.2.  TCP RST
  contents:
  - "2.2.  TCP RST\n   [RFC5382] leaves the handling of TCP RST packets unspecified.\n\
    \   Update:  This document adopts a similar default behavior as in\n      [RFC6146].\
    \  Concretely, when the NAT receives a TCP RST matching\n      an existing mapping,\
    \ it MUST translate the packet according to the\n      NAT mapping entry.  Moreover,\
    \ the NAT SHOULD wait for 4 minutes\n      before deleting the session and removing\
    \ any state associated with\n      it if no packets are received during that 4-minute\
    \ timeout.\n      Notes:\n      *  Admittedly, the NAT has to verify whether received\
    \ TCP RST\n         packets belong to a connection.  This verification check is\n\
    \         required to avoid off-path attacks.\n      *  If the NAT immediately\
    \ removes the NAT mapping upon receipt of\n         a TCP RST message, stale connections\
    \ may be maintained by\n         endpoints if the first RST message is lost between\
    \ the NAT and\n         the recipient.\n"
- title: 3.  Port Overlapping Behavior
  contents:
  - "3.  Port Overlapping Behavior\n   REQ-1 from [RFC4787] and REQ-1 from [RFC5382]\
    \ specify a specific port\n   overlapping behavior; that is, the external IP address\
    \ and port can\n   be reused for connections originating from the same internal\
    \ source\n   IP address and port irrespective of the destination.  This is known\n\
    \   as Endpoint-Independent Mapping (EIM).\n   Update:  This document clarifies\
    \ that this port overlapping behavior\n      may be extended to connections originating\
    \ from different internal\n      source IP addresses and ports as long as their\
    \ destinations are\n      different.\n      The following mechanism MAY be implemented\
    \ by a NAT:\n         If destination addresses and ports are different for outgoing\n\
    \         connections started by local clients, a NAT MAY assign the same\n  \
    \       external port as the source ports for the connections.  The\n        \
    \ port overlapping mechanism manages mappings between external\n         packets\
    \ and internal packets by looking at and storing their\n         5-tuple (protocol,\
    \ source address, source port, destination\n         address, and destination\
    \ port).\n      This enables concurrent use of a single NAT external port for\n\
    \      multiple transport sessions, which allows a NAT to successfully\n     \
    \ process packets in a network that has a limited number of IP\n      addresses\
    \ (e.g., deployment with a high address space\n      multiplicative factor (refer\
    \ to Appendix B of [RFC6269])).\n"
- title: 4.  Address Pooling Paired (APP)
  contents:
  - "4.  Address Pooling Paired (APP)\n   The \"IP address pooling\" behavior of \"\
    Paired\" (APP) was recommended\n   in REQ-2 from [RFC4787], but the behavior when\
    \ an external IPv4 runs\n   out of ports was left undefined.\n   Clarification:\
    \  This document clarifies that if APP is enabled, new\n      sessions from a\
    \ host that already has a mapping associated with an\n      external IP that ran\
    \ out of ports SHOULD be dropped.  A\n      configuration parameter MAY be provided\
    \ to allow a NAT to start\n      using ports from another external IP address\
    \ when the one that\n      anchored the APP mapping ran out of ports.  Tweaking\
    \ this\n      configuration parameter is a trade-off between service continuity\n\
    \      and APP strict enforcement.  Note, this behavior is sometimes\n      referred\
    \ to as \"soft-APP\".\n      As a reminder, the recommendation for the particular\
    \ case of a CGN\n      is that an implementation must use the same external IP\
    \ address\n      mapping for all sessions associated with the same internal IP\n\
    \      address, be they TCP, UDP, ICMP, something else, or a mix of\n      different\
    \ protocols [RFC6888].\n   Update:  This behavior SHOULD apply also for TCP.\n"
- title: 5.  Endpoint-Independent Mapping (EIM) Protocol Independence
  contents:
  - "5.  Endpoint-Independent Mapping (EIM) Protocol Independence\n   REQ-1 from [RFC4787]\
    \ and REQ-1 from [RFC5382] do not specify whether\n   EIM are protocol dependent\
    \ or protocol independent.  For example, if\n   an outbound TCP SYN creates a\
    \ mapping, it is left undefined whether\n   outbound UDP packets can reuse such\
    \ mapping.\n   Update:  EIM mappings SHOULD be protocol dependent.  A configuration\n\
    \      parameter MAY be provided to allow protocols that multiplex TCP\n     \
    \ and UDP over the same source IP address and port number to use a\n      single\
    \ mapping.  The default value of this configuration parameter\n      MUST be protocol-dependent\
    \ EIM.\n      This update is consistent with the stateful Network Address and\n\
    \      Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers (NAT64)\n      [RFC6146]\
    \ that clearly specifies three binding information bases\n      (TCP, UDP, and\
    \ ICMP).\n"
- title: 6.  Endpoint-Independent Filtering (EIF) Protocol Independence
  contents:
  - "6.  Endpoint-Independent Filtering (EIF) Protocol Independence\n   REQ-8 from\
    \ [RFC4787] and REQ-3 from [RFC5382] do not specify whether\n   mappings with\
    \ Endpoint-Independent Filtering (EIF) are protocol\n   independent or protocol\
    \ dependent.  For example, if an outbound TCP\n   SYN creates a mapping, it is\
    \ left undefined whether inbound UDP\n   packets matching that mapping should\
    \ be accepted or rejected.\n   Update:  EIF filtering SHOULD be protocol dependent.\
    \  A configuration\n      parameter MAY be provided to make it protocol independent.\
    \  The\n      default value of this configuration parameter MUST be protocol-\n\
    \      dependent EIF.\n      This behavior is aligned with the update in Section\
    \ 5.\n      Applications that can be transported over a variety of transport\n\
    \      protocols and/or support transport fallback schemes won't\n      experience\
    \ connectivity failures if the NAT is configured with\n      protocol-independent\
    \ EIM and protocol-independent EIF.\n"
- title: 7.  Endpoint-Independent Filtering (EIF) Mapping Refresh
  contents:
  - "7.  Endpoint-Independent Filtering (EIF) Mapping Refresh\n   The NAT mapping\
    \ Refresh direction may have a \"NAT Inbound refresh\n   behavior\" of \"True\"\
    \ according to REQ-6 from [RFC4787], but [RFC4787]\n   does not clarify how this\
    \ behavior applies to EIF mappings.  The\n   issue in question is whether inbound\
    \ packets that match an EIF\n   mapping but do not create a new session due to\
    \ a security policy\n   should refresh the mapping timer.\n   Clarification: \
    \ This document clarifies that even when a NAT has an\n      inbound refresh behavior\
    \ set to \"TRUE\", such packets SHOULD NOT\n      refresh the mapping.  Otherwise,\
    \ a simple attack of a packet every\n      two minutes can keep the mapping indefinitely.\n\
    \   Update:  This behavior SHOULD apply also for TCP.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Outbound Mapping Refresh and Error Packets
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Outbound Mapping Refresh and Error Packets\n   Update:  In the case of\
    \ NAT outbound refresh behavior, ICMP Errors or\n      TCP RST outbound packets\
    \ sent as a response to inbound packets\n      SHOULD NOT refresh the mapping.\
    \  Other packets that indicate the\n      host is not interested in receiving\
    \ packets MAY be configurable to\n      also not refresh state, such as a Session\
    \ Traversal Utilities for\n      NAT (STUN) error response [RFC5389] or IKE INVALID_SYNTAX\n\
    \      [RFC7296].\n"
- title: 8.  Port Parity
  contents:
  - "8.  Port Parity\n   Update:  A NAT MAY disable port parity preservation for all\
    \ dynamic\n      mappings.  Nevertheless, A NAT SHOULD support means to explicitly\n\
    \      request to preserve port parity (e.g., [RFC7753]).\n      Note: According\
    \ to [RFC6887], dynamic mappings are said to be\n      dynamic in the sense that\
    \ they are created on demand, either\n      implicitly or explicitly:\n      1.\
    \  Implicit dynamic mappings refer to mappings that are created\n          as\
    \ a side effect of traffic such as an outgoing TCP SYN or\n          outgoing\
    \ UDP packet.  Implicit dynamic mappings usually have a\n          finite lifetime,\
    \ though this lifetime is generally not known\n          to the client using them.\n\
    \      2.  Explicit dynamic mappings refer to mappings that are created\n    \
    \      as a result, for example, of explicit Port Control Protocol\n         \
    \ (PCP) MAP and PEER requests.  Explicit dynamic mappings have a\n          finite\
    \ lifetime, and this lifetime is communicated to the\n          client.\n"
- title: 9.  Port Randomization
  contents:
  - "9.  Port Randomization\n   Update:  A NAT SHOULD follow the recommendations specified\
    \ in\n      Section 4 of [RFC6056], especially:\n         A NAPT that does not\
    \ implement port preservation [RFC4787]\n         [RFC5382] SHOULD obfuscate selection\

  - "12.  Hairpinning Support for ICMP Packets\n   REQ-7 from [RFC5508] specifies\
    \ that a NAT enforcing Basic NAT must\n   support traversal of hairpinned ICMP\
    \ Query sessions.\n   Clarification:  This implicitly means that address mappings\
    \ from\n      external address to internal address (similar to Endpoint-\n   \
    \   Independent Filters) must be maintained to allow inbound ICMP\n      Query\
    \ sessions.  If an ICMP Query is received on an external\n      address, a NAT\
    \ can then translate to an internal IP.\n   REQ-7 from [RFC5508] specifies that\
    \ all NATs must support the\n   traversal of hairpinned ICMP Error messages.\n\
    \   Clarification:  This behavior requires a NAT to maintain address\n      mappings\
    \ from external IP address to internal IP address in\n      addition to the ICMP\
    \ Query mappings described in Section 3.1 of\n      [RFC5508].\n"
- title: 13.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "13.  Security Considerations\n   NAT behavioral considerations are discussed\
    \ in [RFC4787], [RFC5382],\n   and [RFC5508].\n   Because some of the clarifications\
    \ and updates (e.g., Section 2) are\n   inspired from NAT64, the security considerations\
    \ discussed in\n   Section 5 of [RFC6146] apply also for this specification.\n\
    \   The update in Section 3 allows for an optimized NAT resource usage.\n   In\
    \ order to avoid service disruption, the NAT must not invoke this\n   functionality\
    \ unless the packets are to be sent to distinct\n   destination addresses.\n \
    \  Some of the updates (e.g., Sections 7, 9, and 11) allow for increased\n   security\
    \ compared to [RFC4787], [RFC5382], and [RFC5508].\n   Particularly,\n   o  the\
    \ updates in Sections 7 and 11 prevent an illegitimate node to\n      maintain\
    \ mappings activated in the NAT while these mappings should\n      be cleared,\
    \ and\n   o  port randomization (Section 9) complicates tracking hosts located\n\
    \      behind a NAT.\n   Sections 4 and 12 propose updates that increase the serviceability\
    \ of\n   a host located behind a NAT.  These updates do not introduce any\n  \
    \ additional security concerns to [RFC4787], [RFC5382], and [RFC5508].\n   The\
    \ updates in Sections 5 and 6 allow for a better NAT transparency\n   from an\
    \ application standpoint.  Hosts that require a restricted\n   filtering behavior\
    \ should enable specific policies (e.g., Access\n   Control List (ACL)) either\
    \ locally or by soliciting a dedicated\n   security device (e.g., firewall). \
    \ How a host updates its filtering\n   policies is out of scope of this document.\n\
    \   The update in Section 8 induces security concerns that are specific\n   to\
    \ the protocol used to interact with the NAT.  For example, if PCP\n   is used\
    \ to explicitly request parity preservation for a given\n   mapping, the security\
    \ considerations discussed in [RFC6887] should be\n   taken into account.\n  \
    \ The update in Section 10 may have undesired effects on the\n   performance of\
    \ the NAT in environments in which fragmentation is\n   massively experienced.\
    \  Such an issue may be used as an attack vector\n   against NATs.\n"
