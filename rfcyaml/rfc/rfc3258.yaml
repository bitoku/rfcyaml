    \ an\n   authoritative name server operator to provide access to a single\n  \
    \ named server in multiple locations.  The primary motivation for the\n   development\
    \ and deployment of these practices is to increase the\n   distribution of DNS\

    \ reduce the latency for DNS query responses in\n   those areas.  This document\
    \ presumes a one-to-one mapping between\n   named authoritative servers and administrative\
    \ entities (operators).\n   This document contains no guidelines or recommendations\
    \ for caching\n   name servers.  The shared unicast system described here is specific\n\
    \   to IPv4; applicability to IPv6 is an area for further study.  It\n   should\
    \ also be noted that the system described here is related to\n   that described\
    \ in [ANYCAST], but it does not require dedicated\n   address space, routing changes,\
    \ or the other elements of a full\n   anycast infrastructure which that document\

  contents:
  - "2.1 Server Requirements\n   Operators of authoritative name servers may wish\
    \ to refer to\n   [SECONDARY] and [ROOT] for general guidance on appropriate practice\n\
    \   for authoritative name servers.  In addition to proper configuration\n   as\
    \ a standard authoritative name server, each of the hosts\n   participating in\
    \ a shared-unicast system should be configured with\n   two network interfaces.\
    \  These interfaces may be either two physical\n   interfaces or one physical\
    \ interface mapped to two logical\n   interfaces.  One of the network interfaces\
    \ should use the IPv4 shared\n   unicast address associated with the authoritative\
    \ name server.  The\n   other interface, referred to as the administrative interface\
    \ below,\n   should use a distinct IPv4 address specific to that host.  The host\n\
    \   should respond to DNS queries only on the shared-unicast interface.\n   In\
    \ order to provide the most consistent set of responses from the\n   mesh of anycast\
    \ hosts, it is good practice to limit responses on that\n   interface to zones\
    \ for which the host is authoritative.\n"
- title: 2.2 Zone file delivery
  contents:
  - "2.2 Zone file delivery\n   In order to minimize the risk of man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, zone\n   files should be delivered to the administrative interface\
    \ of the\n   servers participating in the mesh.  Secure file transfer methods\
    \ and\n   strong authentication should be used for all transfers.  If the hosts\n\
    \   in the mesh make their zones available for zone transfer, the\n   administrative\
    \ interfaces should be used for those transfers as well,\n   in order to avoid\
    \ the problems with potential routing changes for TCP\n   traffic noted in section\
    \ 2.5 below.\n"
- title: 2.3 Synchronization
  contents:
  - "2.3 Synchronization\n   Authoritative name servers may be loosely or tightly\
    \ synchronized,\n   depending on the practices set by the operating organization.\
    \  As\n   noted below in section 4.1.2, lack of synchronization among servers\n\
    \   using the same shared unicast address could create problems for some\n   users\
    \ of this service.  In order to minimize that risk, switch-overs\n   from one\
    \ data set to another data set should be coordinated as much\n   as possible.\
    \  The use of synchronized clocks on the participating\n   hosts and set times\
    \ for switch-overs provides a basic level of\n   coordination.  A more complete\
    \ coordination process would involve:\n      a) receipt of zones at a distribution\
    \ host\n      b) confirmation of the integrity of zones received\n      c) distribution\
    \ of the zones to all of the servers in the mesh\n      d) confirmation of the\
    \ integrity of the zones at each server\n      e) coordination of the switchover\
    \ times for the servers in the\n         mesh\n      f) institution of a failure\
    \ process to ensure that servers that\n         did not receive correct data or\
    \ could not switchover to the new\n         data ceased to respond to incoming\
    \ queries until the problem\n         could be resolved.\n   Depending on the\
    \ size of the mesh, the distribution host may also be\n   a participant; for authoritative\
    \ servers, it may also be the host on\n   which zones are generated.\n   This\
    \ document presumes that the usual DNS failover methods are the\n   only ones\
    \ used to ensure reachability of the data for clients.  It\n   does not advise\
    \ that the routes be withdrawn in the case of failure;\n   it advises instead\
    \ that the DNS process shutdown so that servers on\n   other addresses are queried.\
    \  This recommendation reflects a choice\n   between performance and operational\
    \ complexity.  While it would be\n   possible to have some process withdraw the\
    \ route for a specific\n   server instance when it is not available, there is\
    \ considerable\n   operational complexity involved in ensuring that this occurs\n\
    \   reliably.  Given the existing DNS failover methods, the marginal\n   improvement\
    \ in performance will not be sufficient to justify the\n   additional complexity\
    \ for most uses.\n"
- title: 2.4 Server Placement
  contents:
  - "2.4 Server Placement\n   Though the geographic diversity of server placement\
    \ helps reduce the\n   effects of service disruptions due to local problems, it\
    \ is diversity\n   of placement in the network topology which is the driving force\n\
    \   behind these distribution practices.  Server placement should\n   emphasize\
    \ that diversity.  Ideally, servers should be placed\n   topologically near the\
    \ points at which the operator exchanges routes\n   and traffic with other networks.\n"
- title: 2.5 Routing
  contents:
  - "2.5 Routing\n   The organization administering the mesh of servers sharing a\
    \ unicast\n   address must have an autonomous system number and speak BGP to its\n\
    \   peers.  To those peers, the organization announces a route to the\n   network\
    \ containing the shared-unicast address of the name server.\n   The organization's\
    \ border routers must then deliver the traffic\n   destined for the name server\
    \ to the nearest instantiation.  Routing\n   to the administrative interfaces\
    \ for the servers can use the normal\n   routing methods for the administering\
    \ organization.\n   One potential problem with using shared unicast addresses\
    \ is that\n   routers forwarding traffic to them may have more than one available\n\
    \   route, and those routes may, in fact, reach different instances of\n   the\
    \ shared unicast address.  Applications like the DNS, whose\n   communication\
    \ typically consists of independent request-response\n   messages each fitting\
    \ in a single UDP packet present no problem.\n   Other applications, in which\
    \ multiple packets must reach the same\n   endpoint (e.g., TCP) may fail or present\
    \ unworkable performance\n   characteristics in some circumstances.  Split-destination\
    \ failures\n   may occur when a router does per-packet (or round-robin) load\n\
    \   sharing, a topology change occurs that changes the relative metrics\n   of\
    \ two paths to the same anycast destination, etc.\n   Four things mitigate the\
    \ severity of this problem.  The first is that\n   UDP is a fairly high proportion\
    \ of the query traffic to name servers.\n   The second is that the aim of this\
    \ proposal is to diversify\n   topological placement; for most users, this means\
    \ that the\n   coordination of placement will ensure that new instances of a name\n\
    \   server will be at a significantly different cost metric from existing\n  \
    \ instances.  Some set of users may end up in the middle, but that\n   should\
    \ be relatively rare.  The third is that per packet load sharing\n   is only one\
    \ of the possible load sharing mechanisms, and other\n   mechanisms are increasing\
    \ in popularity.\n   Lastly, in the case where the traffic is TCP, per packet\
    \ load sharing\n   is used, and equal cost routes to different instances of a\
    \ name\n   server are available, any DNS implementation which measures the\n \
    \  performance of servers to select a preferred server will quickly\n   prefer\
    \ a server for which this problem does not occur.  For the DNS\n   failover mechanisms\
    \ to reliably avoid this problem, however, those\n   using shared unicast distribution\
    \ mechanisms must take care that all\n   of the servers for a specific zone are\
    \ not participants in the same\n   shared-unicast mesh.  To guard even against\
    \ the case where multiple\n   meshes have a set of users affected by per packet\
    \ load sharing along\n   equal cost routes, organizations implementing these practices\
    \ should\n   always provide at least one authoritative server which is not a\n\
    \   participant in any shared unicast mesh.  Those deploying shared-\n   unicast\
    \ meshes should note that any specific host may become\n   unreachable to a client\
    \ should a server fail, a path fail, or the\n   route to that host be withdrawn.\
    \  These error conditions are,\n   however, not specific to shared-unicast distributions,\
    \ but would\n   occur for standard unicast hosts.\n   Since ICMP response packets\
    \ might go to a different member of the\n   mesh than that sending a packet, packets\
    \ sent with a shared unicast\n   source address should also avoid using path MTU\
    \ discovery.\n   Appendix A. contains an ASCII diagram of an example of a simple\n\
    \   implementation of this system.  In it, the odd numbered routers\n   deliver\
    \ traffic to the shared-unicast interface network and filter\n   traffic from\
    \ the administrative network; the even numbered routers\n   deliver traffic to\
    \ the administrative network and filter traffic from\n   the shared-unicast network.\
    \  These are depicted as separate routers\n   for the ease this gives in explanation,\
    \ but they could easily be\n   separate interfaces on the same router.  Similarly,\
    \ a local NTP\n   source is depicted for synchronization, but the level of\n \
    \  synchronization needed would not require that source to be either\n   local\
    \ or a stratum one NTP server.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1 Points of Contact\n   A single point of contact for reporting problems is\
    \ crucial to the\n   correct administration of this system.  If an external user\
    \ of the\n   system needs to report a problem related to the service, there must\n\
    \   be no ambiguity about whom to contact.  If internal monitoring does\n   not\
    \ indicate a problem, the contact may, of course, need to work with\n   the external\
    \ user to identify which server generated the error.\n"

- title: 4.1.1 Increase in physical servers
  contents:
  - "4.1.1 Increase in physical servers\n   The architecture outlined in this document\
    \ increases the number of\n   physical servers, which could increase the possibility\
    \ that a server\n   mis-configuration will occur which allows for a security breach.\
    \  In\n   general, the entity administering a mesh should ensure that patches\n\
    \   and security mechanisms applied to a single member of the mesh are\n   appropriate\
    \ for and applied to all of the members of a mesh.\n   \"Genetic diversity\" (code\
    \ from different code bases) can be a useful\n   security measure in avoiding\
    \ attacks based on vulnerabilities in a\n   specific code base; in order to ensure\
    \ consistency of responses from\n   a single named server, however, that diversity\
    \ should be applied to\n   different shared-unicast meshes or between a mesh and\
    \ a related\n   unicast authoritative server.\n"
- title: 4.1.2 Data synchronization problems
  contents:
  - "4.1.2 Data synchronization problems\n   The level of systemic synchronization\
    \ described above should be\n   augmented by synchronization of the data present\
    \ at each of the\n   servers.  While the DNS itself is a loosely coupled system,\
    \ debugging\n   problems with data in specific zones would be far more difficult\
    \ if\n   two different servers sharing a single unicast address might return\n\
    \   different responses to the same query.  For example, if the data\n   associated\
    \ with www.example.com has changed and the administrators of\n   the domain are\
    \ testing for the changes at the example.com\n   authoritative name servers, they\
    \ should not need to check each\n   instance of a named authoritative server.\
    \  The use of NTP to provide\n   a synchronized time for switch-over eliminates\
    \ some aspects of this\n   problem, but mechanisms to handle failure during the\
    \ switchover are\n   required.  In particular, a server which cannot make the\
    \ switchover\n   must not roll-back to a previous version; it must cease to respond\
    \ to\n   queries so that other servers are queried.\n"
- title: 4.1.3 Distribution risks
  contents:
  - "4.1.3 Distribution risks\n   If the mechanism used to distribute zone files among\
    \ the servers is\n   not well secured, a man-in-the-middle attack could result\
    \ in the\n   injection of false information.  Digital signatures will alleviate\n\
    \   this risk, but encrypted transport and tight access lists are a\n   necessary\
    \ adjunct to them.  Since zone files will be distributed to\n   the administrative\
    \ interfaces of meshed servers, the access control\n   list for distribution of\
    \ the zone files should include the\n   administrative interface of the server\
    \ or servers, rather than their\n   shared unicast addresses.\n"
- title: 4.2 Decreased Risks
  contents:
  - "4.2 Decreased Risks\n   The increase in number of physical servers reduces the\
    \ likelihood\n   that a denial-of-service attack will take out a significant portion\n\
    \   of the DNS infrastructure.  The increase in servers also reduces the\n   effect\
    \ of machine crashes, fiber cuts, and localized disasters by\n   reducing the\
    \ number of users dependent on a specific machine.\n"
