Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) based event notification management of Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems.
This MIB is defined as an extension to the DOCSIS Cable Device MIB.
This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2).
The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [16].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [2], STD 58, RFC 2579
[3] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [4].
The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable system usage, or from the documents associated with the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) process.
BPI Baseline Privacy Interface A mechanism for providing data privacy over the HFC network in DOCSIS 1.0 systems [8].
Interface A mechanism that extends the Baseline Privacy Interface with the addition of CM authentication over the HFC network in DOCSIS 1.1/2.0 systems and beyond [9].
CATV Originally "Community Antenna Television", now used to refer to any cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals to a community.
A CM acts as a "slave" station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data system.
CMTS Cable Modem Termination System
A generic term covering a cable bridge or cable router in a head end.
A CMTS acts as the master station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data system.
It is the only station that transmits downstream, and it controls the scheduling of upstream transmissions by its associated CMs.
DOCSIS DOCSIS stands for "Data over Cable Service Interface Specifications" and refers to the ITU T J.112 Annex B standard for cable modem systems [10], [13] commonly known as DOCSIS 1.0.
The DOCSIS 1.1 specification is an extension of DOCSIS 1.0, with new features to support quality of service, fragmentation, and requirements for European cable plants [14].
DOCSIS 2.0 [15] builds upon DOCSIS 1.1 and provides all of the features and functionality that DOCSIS 1.1 provides.
In addition, it provides some significant enhancements in upstream capacity over DOCSIS 1.1, such as 30.72 Mbps maximum upstream channel capacity, Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) operation, increased robustness to upstream noise and channel impairments, Enhanced Reed  Solomon error correction, and Trellis Coded Modulation.
The direction from the CMTS to the CM.
Head end The origination point in most cable systems of the subscriber video signals.
Generally also the location of the CMTS equipment.
MAC Packet A term referring to DOCSIS Protocol Data Unit (PDU).
RF A term referring to Radio Frequency.
SID A term referring to DOCSIS Service ID.
The SID identifies a particular upstream bandwidth allocation and class of service management for DOCSIS, and identifies a particular bidirectional security association for BPI. 2.12.
TLV TLV stands for Type/Length/Value.
TLV is an encoding method consisting of three fields.
The first field indicates the type of element, the second field indicates the length of the element, and the third field contains the element's value.
The direction from the CM to the CMTS.
Overview Offering High Speed Internet Service in the cable industry has become extremely successful.
DOCSIS devices are being deployed at a rate of multiple thousands per day.
Although operators are enjoying successful deployment, they are also facing the challenge of properly managing deployed devices.
Operators are using Simple Network Management Protocol, a set of Management Information Base (MIB) required by DOCSIS, and SNMP Notifications to manage deployed DOCSIS devices.
The usage of SNMP Notification for event reporting is becoming more popular as an effective and efficient method for network monitoring.
Unfortunately, only a minimal set of SNMP Notifications is currently available.
This notification MIB, in conjunction with [11] and [12], provides a minimum set of standard DOCSIS Notifications that DOCSIS devices SHOULD support to enable successful management of DOCSIS devices and networks.
This document defines a set of objects required for the event notification management of DOCSIS compliant Cable Modems (CMs) and Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTSs).
The MIB module is derived from the DOCSIS [11] and [12].
Appendix H of [11] defines all DOCSIS 1.1 required events, and Appendix D of [12]
does that for DOCSIS 2.0.
The notifications specified in this document are used to notify these events via SNMP.
In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].
This DOCS IETF CABLE DEVICE
NOTIFICATION MIB was designed to extend the RFC2669 [5] notification module.
Two groups of SNMP notification objects are defined in this document.
One group defines notifications for cable modem events, and the other group defines notifications for cable modem termination system events.
DOCSIS defines numerous events, and each event is assigned to a functional category.
This MIB defines a notification object for each functional category.
The varbinding list of each notification includes information about the event that occurred on the device.
The MIB module defined here IMPORTs from SNMPv2 SMI [2], SNMPv2
CONF [3], DOCS CABLE DEVICE MIB [5],
IF MIB [6], and IF MIB [7].

The Event Notification MIB is an extension of the CABLE DEVICE MIB.
It defines various notification objects for both cable modem and cable modem termination systems.
Two groups of SNMP notification objects are defined.
One group is for notifying cable modem events, and one group is for notifying cable modem termination system events.
DOCSIS defines numerous events, and each event is assigned to a functional category.
This MIB defines a notification object for each functional category.
The varbinding list of each notification includes information about the event that occurred on the device.
This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 4547; see the RFC itself for full legal notices."

There are two management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create (docsDevCmNotifControl and docsDevCmtsNotifControl).
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Setting docsDevCmNotifControl or docsDevCmtsNotifControl may cause flooding of notifications, which can disrupt network service.
Besides causing "flooding", changing the objects can also mean that notifications will not be emitted when one intends that to happen.
This MIB defines a number of notification objects that send detailed information about the event that caused the generation of the notification.
Information in the notification message includes: event priority, the event Id, the event message body, the CM DOCSIS capability, the CM DOCSIS QOS level, the CM DOCSIS upstream modulation type, the cable interface MAC address of the cable modem, and the cable card MAC address of the CMTS to which the modem is connected.
The monitoring of these notification messages could be used to gather information about the state of the network and devices (CM and CMTS) attached to the network.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [16], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The MIB module defined in this document uses the following IANA  assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
{ mib 2 132 }
