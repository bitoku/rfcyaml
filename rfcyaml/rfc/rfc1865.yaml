    \   4.1.  Why is the way we currently do EDI so limiting to its\n         growth?\
    \  ..................................................  15\n   4.2.  My organization\
    \ has an internal automated system for\n         processing requisitions and issuing\
    \ purchase orders, but it\n         does not create the X12 formatted EDI transactions;\
    \ what\n         should we do ?  ........................................... \
    \ 16\n   4.3.  My organization already has a dial-in bulletin board\n        \

    \ with each trading partner we're currently\n         doing business with. Can\
    \ we keep them ?  ..................  16\n   4.5.  It would be nice to get more\
    \ trading partners and/or\n         more competition, but I'm worried about getting\
    \ too many\n         transactions to be able to handle them.  Has this been a\n\

    \ presume the services of companies called\n         Value Added Networks (VANs)?\
    \  .............................  19\n   5.5.  If I can use X12 protocol and my\

    \ Internet?  ............................................  20\n   5.6.  Can we\
    \ expect VANs to offer connections to other VANs\n         via the Internet? \

    \ directly for exchanging EDI\n         messages without going through a VAN?\
    \  ....................  20\n   5.8.  Can the ISA 06 or 08 identify any entity\
    \ other than the\n         'end' Trading Partners (i.e. a routing entity) ?  .........\
    \  21\n   5.9.  Can we specify both the recipient's address and their\n      \
    \   VAN address in the ISA ?  ................................   22\n   5.10.\
    \ Are there other options for routing EDI X12\n         messages ? ...............................................\

  contents:
  - "2.1.  What is the Internet ?\n   It is the inter-working of existing corporate\
    \ and government networks\n   using commonly used telecommunications standards.\
    \  It is not a new\n   physical network, although some new facilities may be needed.\n\
    \   Rather, it is based on mutual interests of users to communicate more\n   effectively\
    \ via electronic message and file transfers.  Internet\n   communications may\
    \ be interpersonal (person-to-person) E-Mail or\n   process-to-process like EDI.\
    \  Messages may be inquiries to shared\n   databases and responses. Messages may\

  - "2.2.  Is there a difference between EDI and electronic commerce (EC) ?\n   Electronic\
    \ Data Interchange (EDI) is defined as the inter-process\n   (computer application\
    \ to computer application) communication of\n   business information in a standardized\
    \ electronic form.  Electronic\n   Commerce includes EDI, but recognizes the need\
    \ for inter-personal\n   (human to human) communications, the transfer of moneys,\
    \ and the\n   sharing of common data bases as additional activities that aid in\
    \ the\n   efficient conduct of business.  By incorporating a wide range of\n \
    \  technologies, EC is much broader than EDI.  However, the focus of\n   this\
    \ document in on EDI, not electronic commerce.\n"

  - "2.3.  What makes the Internet useful for EDI ?\n   The greatest benefits will\
    \ derive from:\n      o  Adoption of common standards and proven inter-operable\
    \ systems,\n      o  Adoption and deployment of a distributed Directory Service\n\
    \         capability, so that one can readily contact electronically any\n   \
    \      other organization in the world.\n      o  Explicit commitment by participating\

  - "2.4.  Does this means we will now have to coordinate our EC/EDI\n      activities\
    \ with the Internet?\n   The Internet is not an organization or government agency.\
    \  You use\n   the Internet to do business like you would use the telephone. \
    \ The\n   same Internet connection your organization uses to send electronic\n\
    \   mail would be the one you use to send EDI transactions.  Software\n   developers\
    \ write EDI translators, packages or templates for your e-\n   mail system so\

    \ if I don't have to coordinate my EDI activities with\n      a central organization\
    \ or VAN?\n   The Internet works by assigning names or \"domains\" to\n   networks/companies/machines.\
    \  This is called the Domain Name Service\n   (DNS). It works from a distributed\
    \ tree structure.  The Internet\n   requires registration of your Internet Protocol\
    \ (IP) address and\n   Domain Name in the Domain Name Service (DNS).  Your internet\
    \ service\n   provider can do this for you or assist you in contacting the right\n\
    \   people to get your assigned addresses and domain names.\n"
- title: 2.6.  How fast is the Internet?
  contents:
  - "2.6.  How fast is the Internet?\n   For a modest amount of data with a dedicated\
    \ connection, a message\n   transmission would occur in a matter of seconds, unless\
    \ the ISP\n   selected one of the trading partners is overloaded.  The maximum\n\
    \   delay over the internet backbones is at most a few seconds.  Like the\n  \
    \ interstate highway system, speed depends on how close you and your\n   trading\
    \ partner are to Internet backbones.  Unfortunately, some areas\n   may lack the\
    \ capacity or \"bandwidth\" to handle the workload your\n   organization requires.\
    \  Contact your local Internet Service Provider\n   for details on service in\
    \ your area.  Also, the more you are willing\n   to spend, the better the service.\
    \  The Internet is inexpensive, but\n   (contrary to popular mythology) it is\
    \ not free.\n"
- title: 2.7.  What about reliability of the Internet?
  contents:
  - "2.7.  What about reliability of the Internet?\n   For high reliability mission\
    \ critical applications, redundant ISPs\n   may be used (with separate backbones),\
    \ and redundant mail servers at\n   separate locations can be used. A single internet\
    \ email or server\n   address can be used to transparently route to any of the\
    \ redundant\n   servers or network connections.\n   If a dedicated Internet connection\
    \ is used to transmit information,\n   e.g., via SMTP (see questions 3.2 and 3.5),\
    \ then the message is\n   delivered directly to the trading partner's system and\
    \ delivery is\n   assured. If a part time store and forward connection is used,\
    \ then\n   the integrity of the message depends on the ISP or other computers\n\
    \   used in the forwarding of a message.\n"

  - "3.1.  What do I need to get to use the Internet?\n   You need to know your existing\
    \ telecommunications connectivity,\n   address resolution, and routing capabilities.\
    \  Then you need to\n   establish and operate an Electronic Mail gateway and/or\
    \ other\n   application gateway, e.g., for the file transfer protocol (FTP).\n\
    \   Larger organizations may supply their trading partners with the\n   TCP/IP\

- title: 3.2.  What software is used to support electronic mail?
  contents:
  - "3.2.  What software is used to support electronic mail?\n   a) Simple Mail Transfer\
    \ Protocol (SMTP) Servers\n      A dedicated internet connection usually uses\
    \ SMTP software to send\n      and receive messages. The SMTP server may transfer\
    \ messages to the\n      \"spool\" area for incoming email in the file system,\
    \ may queue the\n      messages for transmission via UUCP, may hold mail in a\
    \ POP server,\n      or may transfer the message to a proprietary email system.\n\
    \   b) Unix-to-Unix Copy (UUCP) Servers\n      A UUCP server is used to transfer\
    \ messages when a store and\n      forward is used, either between machines within\
    \ a WAN, or to\n      another machine with a dialup link.\n   c) Post Office Protocol\
    \ (POP) mail Servers\n      A POP server holds email which can later be retrieved\
    \ by a client\n      application run by the user, typically on a PC which might\
    \ not be\n      running 24 hours a day.  The TCP/IP protocol is used either over\
    \ a\n      LAN or dialup SLIP connection to retrieve messages.\n   d) Mail User\
    \ Agents (Mail Readers)\n      Uses or applications employ client programs to\
    \ retrieve and\n      display email messages from the file system mail spool area,\
    \ or\n      from another server computer using POP or some other proprietary\n\
    \      protocol (e.g. Microsoft-Mail). This mail user agent (UA) software\n  \
    \    is also used to compose and send email via a POP server or system\n     \
    \ email.\n      The mail user agent may also process attached files using a\n\
    \      proprietary format within a mail message, using one of the common\n   \
    \   de-facto standards, or using the Multipurpose Internet Mail\n      Extensions\
    \ (MIME) internet standard.  Among other things, MIME\n      permits the identification\
    \ and concatenation of message parts\n      (called \"body parts\") into a single\
    \ message that can traverse the\n      Internet using the SMTP protocol.  The\
    \ Work in Progress, \"EDI in\n      MIME\"  provides the necessary standards for\
    \ MIME compliant user\n      agents to identify EDI body parts.  A MIME compliant\
    \ mail reader\n      can process the contents of the messages and dispatch data\
    \ to\n      external software. For example, files can be dragged to file\n   \
    \   system directories, images can be displayed, and audio data can be\n     \
    \ played.  In the case of EDI, a message formatted according to the\n      MIME-EDI\
    \ specification could be automatically transferred to an\n      EDI processing\
    \ program.\n   e) Automated Mail Processing\n      A typical Mail User Agents\
    \ is an interactive application. However\n      there are automated email message\
    \ processing programs which can\n      sort incoming mail, process forms returned\
    \ by others, or in the\n      case of EDI data, transfer the message contents\
    \ to the EDI system.\n      Messages formatted according to the MIME EDI specification\
    \ can be\n      properly recognized by any MIME compliant mail processing program.\n"
- title: 3.3.  What types of client-server or server-server protocols exist on
  contents:
  - "3.3.  What types of client-server or server-server protocols exist on\n     \
    \ the Internet?\n   Internet email is typically used for two party messaging.\
    \ The FTP,\n   gopher, and HTTP protocols allow many users, possibly anonymous,\
    \ to\n   retrieve data from a central source. For example, corporate catalogs\n\
    \   can be restricted by potential customers.\n   a) File Transfer Protocol (FTP)\n\
    \      Companies with existing connectivity to the Internet may use FTP\n    \
    \  to transfer files to one-another or to their VAN.  This solution\n      employs\
    \ the same TCP/IP used for SMTP.  Furthermore, Internet\n      documents such\
    \ as EDI in MIME Work in Progress are available via\n      FTP on the FTP server\
    \ \"ds.internic.net.\"\n   b) gopher service protocol.\n      Gopher service is\
    \ a way of organizing selected documents and files\n      on an Internet server\
    \ in a simple tree menu, so that users on\n      other Internet computers can\
    \ find them easily.  Most gopher menus\n      are also linked to other gopher\
    \ menus elsewhere, so that users can\n      easily jump from one Internet server\
    \ to another.  There are\n      thousands of gopher servers in operation worldwide.\n\
    \   c) The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\n      HTTP defines http-server\
    \ and http-clients that comprise the World\n      Wide Web (WWW).  WWW was developed\
    \ by the European Laboratory for\n      Particle Physics (CERN) as a tool for\
    \ exchanging multimedia data\n      between researchers.  Although there is also\
    \ no specification for\n      graphics in HTTP, most web browsers are graphical\
    \ in nature.\n      Mosaic, available free from the National Center for Supercomputer\n\
    \      Applications (NCSA), provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n      that\
    \ facilitates user access to information on the Internet.\n      Mosaic interprets\
    \ hypertext based information on the WWW, as well\n      as to other linked Index/Directory\
    \ services such as Archie, FTP,\n      Gopher, and X.500 Directory information.\
    \  Mosaic also supports on\n      line Graphic Interchange Format (GIF), Joint\
    \ Photographic Experts\n      Group (JPEG), Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG),\
    \ QuickTime, and\n      other document, image, and audio types.  Vendors have\
    \ developed\n      product catalogues using Mosaic servers.\n   d) WHOIS\n   \
    \   WHOIS servers generally offer information about the organization\n      to\
    \ which they belong.  There are many WHOIS servers scattered\n      throughout\
    \ the Internet.  To obtain a list of registered WHOIS\n      servers, anonymous\
    \ FTP to rtfm.mit.edu and get the file\n      /pub/whois/whois-servers.list. \
    \ You can:\n       o   run a client program on your own machine to access the\n\
    \           WHOIS server,\n       o   telnet to a site which hosts the server,\
    \ eg: telnet to\n           whois.internic.net and type help to access the full\
    \ online\n           help\n       o   send an email message to retrieve information\
    \ from the\n           database.  eg: send email to mailserv@internic.net with\n\
    \           a command in the Subject field.  Any information in the\n        \
    \   body part of message will be ignored.  ie.\n                Subject:  whois\
    \ <search string>\n           Therefore, to find information on the Internic Registration\n\
    \           Service, the subject should contain: whois internic\n           Moreover,\
    \ to obtain help information on this service you can\n           send two separate\
    \ email with the following in their subject\n           line, respectively:\n\
    \                             help\n                             whois help\n"
- title: 3.4.  What methods exist to broadcast information across the Internet?
  contents:
  - "3.4.  What methods exist to broadcast information across the Internet?\n   There\
    \ are also some usual methods to broadcast messages to multiple\n   recipients\
    \ as described below:\n   a) Usenet News\n      Usenet news is a cooperative broadcast\
    \ of messages to all\n      participants.  Messages are organized into categories\
    \ called\n      newsgroups, and there are over 10,000 newsgroups carried by the\n\
    \      major ISPs.  Individual customers typically subscribe to some\n      subset\
    \ of these which is of interest to the organization.\n      Messages are typically\
    \ held for a week or two, then either\n      archived or discarded.  Some newsgroups\
    \ are free form, i.e. anyone\n      can post a message, while others are \"moderated\"\
    , i.e. require\n      approval prior to posting.\n      Though not currently used\
    \ for any type of EDI, Usenet news could\n      be used to broadcast RFQs. For\
    \ example, comp.newprod is used to\n      announce new products, and misc.jobs.wanted\
    \ is used to announce\n      job openings.\n   b) Mailing Lists\n      If the\
    \ interest is limited, a mailing list may be used in lieu of\n      a newsgroup.\
    \  These are typically used for discussion groups or\n      announcements of a\
    \ particular nature.  Mailing lists are typically\n      open, i.e. anyone can\
    \ \"subscribe\" by sending an email message to a\n      server. For discussion\
    \ groups, anyone can send a message to the\n      server which is then rebroadcast\
    \ to all subscribers.  Since\n      Internet email is extremely inexpensive, there\
    \ is normally no\n      charge for use of a mailing list, except for the content\
    \ of\n      e-magazines, etc.  Sponsors of an email list typically provide the\n\
    \      list as a public service.\n      For example, a mailing list could be used\
    \ to broadcast EDI RFQs,\n      etc.  Vendors might subscribe to various lists\
    \ related to their\n      product or service in order to receive messages sent\
    \ by potential\n      customers. Mailing lists could be provided by large companies\
    \ for\n      internal use, by industry organizations, or VANs.  For example, a\n\
    \      firm or government agency could sponsor various mailing lists for\n   \
    \   EDI RFQ's, new product announcements, etc. related to procurement.\n     \
    \ The organization could easily allow other potential customers to\n      use\
    \ the same mailing lists to contact vendors.  All parties would\n      benefit,\
    \ and the improved access to vendors from an open mailing\n      list would more\
    \ than offset the cost to support the mailing list\n      server. Thus service\
    \ might be available for free.\n"
- title: 3.5.  What are the ways to connect to the Internet ?
  contents:
  - "3.5.  What are the ways to connect to the Internet ?\n   The following provides\
    \ a general overview of connectivity options now\n   available:\n   a) Dedicated\
    \ Connection\n      Typically a leased telephone line is used to connect a gateway\n\
    \      computer or Typically a leased telephone line is used to connect a\n  \
    \    gateway computer or bridge/router of a corporate LAN/WAN to the\n      router\
    \ of the Internet Service Provider's (ISP) Point-Of-Presence\n      (POP, not\
    \ to be confused with the Post Office Protocol). The\n      connection may be\
    \ of various types and speeds, e.g.  modem, ISDN,\n      DS0, or DS1 line.\n \
    \     With a dedicated connection, the SMTP protocol is typically used\n     \
    \ to deliver email directly to a trading partners system. Also,\n      real-time\
    \ client server applications can be run directly with a\n      trading partners\
    \ system, including information transferred using\n      the FTP and HTTP protocols.\n\
    \      Some ISPs provide optional services even with dedicated\n      connections.\
    \  For example, store and forward email on an ISP\n      server can be used as\
    \ a backup for a direct SMTP server operated\n      by a trading partner.  The\
    \ ISP may offer disk space on their FTP\n      and HTTP servers with a high speed\
    \ connection to the Internet.\n      For example, a trading partner might use\
    \ a 14.4Kb modem for\n      dedicated email transfers and use a 1.5Mb connection\
    \ operated by\n      the ISP to distribute FTP and HTTP information.\n   b) On-demand\
    \ Connection\n      An on-demand connection operates like a dedicated connection,\n\
    \      except a dialup ISDN or modem connection is used. If the link\n      remains\
    \ idle for a certain period of time, the connection is\n      dropped.  Some ISPs\
    \ offer dial-out capability so any inbound or\n      outbound traffic can reestablish\
    \ the link. However, many ISPs\n      require their customers to dial-in, so only\
    \ outbound traffic and\n      regular polling will establish the link. In the\
    \ latter case, store\n      and forward would likely be used for email, and the\
    \ ISP servers\n      would be used for FTP and HTTP information.\n   c) Part-time\
    \ Polled Connection\n      The Unix-to-Unix Copy (UUCP) protocol is typically\
    \ used for email,\n      news, and (rarely) file transfers.  A client organization\n\
    \      periodically dials the ISP and transfers email and Usenet news for\n  \
    \    the organization, then disconnects.  Typically, the client polls\n      the\
    \ ISP at regular intervals, e.g. every 20 minutes, though some\n      ISPs dial\
    \ out when a message is to be delivered.  Outgoing email\n      can be sent immediately,\
    \ or queued for transmission with a\n      specified maximum delay.\n      A UUCP\
    \ connection may be used to transfer messages to an arbitrary\n      number of\
    \ people or automated mail processing programs.  A single\n      UUCP connection\
    \ may also route messages to other systems, e.g.\n      divisions within a corporation.\
    \  UUCP and store-and-forward are\n      synonymous.\n      Since UUCP is only\
    \ used to transfer mail and news messages,\n      interactive internet client-server\
    \ applications like FTP and HTTP\n      are not available, except using a server\
    \ provided by an ISP. Thus\n      a separate dialup account might be needed to\
    \ retrieve information\n      from other FTP or HTTP servers. UUCP might be used\
    \ for automated\n      email transfer, and a on-demand dialup connection would\
    \ be used\n      for interactive internet client applications.\n      Though UUCP\
    \ accounts imply a delay (up to the polling interval) in\n      processing a message,\
    \ many ISPs allow a customer supplied script\n      to process messages immediately\
    \ on the ISP's machine.  Though UUCP\n      can be used to transfer files directly,\
    \ usually files are\n      transferred by encoding them within an email message.\n\
    \      Transmission within internet email messages is much more widely\n     \
    \ supported and can be gatewayed into proprietary systems.\n   d) Dial-up Shell\
    \ Account\n      With a dial-up account, a single user with a personal computer\n\
    \      running a terminal emulator connects to the ISP's computer.  Mail\n   \
    \   readers, news readers, HTTP browsers, etc. can be run on the ISP\n      machine.\
    \ Data on the ISP machine can be transferred to the\n      personal computer manually\
    \ using a protocol like X-Modem, Z-Modem,\n      or Kermit.\n      The ISP's host\
    \ computer may run one of the usual UNIX command line\n      (shell) programs,\
    \ or may use a custom BBS or other menu driven\n      user interface. A proprietary\
    \ client-server program may be used in\n      lieu of a terminal emulator to provide\
    \ a graphic user interface.\n      Some of the proprietary GUI clients provide\
    \ access to selected\n      internet applications, e.g. gopher.\n      A dialup\
    \ ISP typically has a direct internet connection, however\n      very low cost\
    \ providers might only have a UUCP connection to the\n      Internet. Some large\
    \ proprietary networks such as CompuServe do\n      not offer a direct internet\
    \ connection, and only support UUCP\n      email and, sometimes, Usenet news gateways\
    \ to the Internet.\n   d) Personal Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) or Point\
    \ to Point\n      Protocol (PPP) Account\n      A SLIP/PPP account is also available\
    \ as a cross between the on\n      demand and dial- up. Like the on-demand account,\
    \ a single user can\n      connect to an ISP and run mail reader, news reader,\
    \ FTP, HTTP\n      browser, etc. client applications directly from a personal\n\
    \      computer.  Unlike the on-demand account, the dial-out computer\n      functions\
    \ as a client only and not a server, and would be used by\n      a single user\
    \ rather than as a gateway to a LAN.\n      With a SLIP/PPP account, the POP (Post-Office-Protocol)\
    \ protocol\n      is used for a user's mail reader client to retrieve messages\n\
    \      stored in the ISP's server.  Unlike, UUCP, the POP servers hold\n     \
    \ mail for a single user (i.e. individual email address).\n      With a SLIP/PPP\
    \ connection any standard TCP/IP application is tied\n      directly into the\
    \ internet.  Thus unlike the proprietary GUI\n      software supplied by the ISP,\
    \ any TCP/IP client application can be\n      used.\n      A program such as TIA\
    \ (The Internet Adapter) can be run on a shell\n      account which allows a standard\
    \ UNIX shell account to function as\n      a SLIP/PPP account.  However, some\
    \ ISPs do not support TIA as they\n      charge extra for SLIP.\n"

  - "4.1.  Why is the way we currently do EDI so limiting to its growth?\n   There\
    \ is a tendency for each organization to establish is own rules\n   and administrative\
    \ policies, leading to rising costs of dealing with\n   multiple trading partners,\
    \ each in turn with its own requirements and\n   procedures.  However, new technologies\
    \ and business practices are\n   necessary if EDI is to move beyond the 30 to\
    \ 40,000 organizations\n   presently using EDI.  According to Department of Labor\
    \ and Internal\n   Revenue Service statistics, there are about 6.2 million entities\
    \ with\n   employees and about 14 million other \"business\" entities.  A business\n\
    \   that wants to sell chairs, for example, would have to check with many\n  \
    \ different customers to see if they had any requirements.  By making\n   it possible\
    \ for a business to use a common method to look for\n   customers, the barriers\
    \ entering to the electronic marketplace are\n   greatly eased.  This does not\
    \ mean that there is only one source that\n   everyone goes to for a list of current\

    \ to a single\n   electronic marketplace.  To communicate with each other, the\
    \ various\n   participants in electronic commerce need to harmonize their\n  \

    \ but I'm worried about getting too many transactions\n      to be able to handle\
    \ them.  Has this been a problem ?\n   The answers to this and related questions\
    \ presupposes a willingness\n   to participate in the open bidding process.  While\
    \ this process is a\n   legal requirement for government agencies, many private\
    \ organizations\n   choose not to adopt the practice.  The technology of the Internet\n\

    \ limit their value.  This is a business decision, not a\n   technical one.  Will\
    \ companies competitively procure critical\n   supplies absent a long term relationship\
    \ with the supplier? For\n   essential inputs that will make or break customer\
    \ satisfaction and\n   productivity, the benefits of competition may not be worth\
    \ the risks.\n   Many organizations experience some increase in the number of\n\
    \   transactions; for competitive procurements, the winning bid should be\n  \
    \ significantly better than those received prior to using the\n   electronic system.\
    \  The impact of an increase in volume needs to be\n   evaluated on a situation\

    \ without going through a VAN?\n   You and your trading partner must agree on\
    \ one of the Internet\n   protocols for exchanging messages and then agree upon\
    \ some details\n   with the exchange.\n   a) Email based messaging\n      The\
    \ simplest and most widely supported means of exchanging\n      messages is via\
    \ internet email. Typically, the IETF-MIME\n      encapsulation specification\
    \ would be used to enclose the EDI\n      data within the email message, and the\
    \ trading partners would\n      need to agree upon an encryption method for secure\
    \ email,\n      typically PEM or PGP (see question 8.4).\n      The trading partners\
    \ would then exchange:\n          1. The internet email address for EDI messages\n\
    \          2. An internet email address for personal communications\n        \
    \     related to EDI\n          3. Agreement on the encryption and digital signature\n\
    \             protocols, including email acknowledgment, e.g.\n             support\
    \ for the \"Return-Receipt-To:\" email header,\n             or X.400 extended\
    \ email header fields.\n          4. Public Keys for PEM or PGP encryption and\
    \ digital\n             signatures.  (or private keys for DES encryption)\n  \
    \        5. Agreement on the format of the message, e.g. IETF MIME/EDI.\n    \
    \  A convention for naming email addresses might be\n      established, e.g. edi@edi.xyzcorp.com\
    \ for messages,\n      ediinfo@xyzcorp.com for an automated response for human\
    \ readable\n      information on establishing internet EDI, and\n      edisupport@xyzcorp.com\
    \ for a personal contact.\n   b) FTP based messaging\n      To exchange EDI messages\
    \ via FTP, some setup information must be\n      included in the trading partner\
    \ agreement. Typically, an account\n      would be created for each trading partner\
    \ for a FTP login,\n      including a password. Typically, each X12 or EDIFACT\
    \ message\n      would be stored in a file, and the trading partner agreement\
    \ would\n      define the conventions for naming files and directories for\n \
    \     the messages.\n      The trading partner agreement would include:\n    \
    \      1. FTP login name and password\n          2. Machine(s) from which the\
    \ login will be accepted\n          3. Additional security protocols, e.g. Kerberos[?]\n\
    \          4. Directory and file naming conventions\n          5. File encryption\
    \ protocols and keys\n          6. Wrappers around EDI data, e.g. MIME/EDI headers,\n\
    \             PEM/PGP wrappers, etc.\n   There are several compression routines\
    \ and utilities available for\n   virtually any computer system that uses the\
    \ Internet.  Many of these\n   utilities will convert across platforms (say UNIX\
    \ to Mac, UNIX to PC,\n   and vise versa) and are available for free from one\
    \ of several ftp\n   archive servers.  Use of these compression routines should\
    \ be used\n   with care when one is employing an encryption technique such as\

    \  Many EDI\n   users simply put the same value in the ISA06 and the GS02, and\
    \ put\n   the same value in the ISA08 and the GS03.  Interestingly, there are\n\
    \   VANs that will broadcast a message.  Other VANs will map the value of\n  \
    \ the ISA08 into a distribution list VAN mailbox ids maintained by the\n   VAN.\

    \ For EDI\n   specifically, the advantages of the IPS are its simplicity, wide\n\
    \   availability, and security provided by Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM,\n   see\
    \ below).  IPS lacks a number of desirable features and incurs\n   something of\

  - "6.7.  How would use of the Internet for Federal procurement change\n      this\
    \ RFQ process?\n   Initially, very few changes may be apparent.  New and existing\
    \ VANs\n   will use the Internet to collect and disseminate EDI transactions;\n\
    \   trading partners may be totally unaware of the change in technology.\n   Prices\
    \ may fall as VANs share telecommunications resources through\n   Internet Protocols\
    \ rather than maintain their own costly proprietary\n   telecommunications services.\
    \  Instead of competing with VANs, the\n   ubiquitous connectivity of the Internet\
    \ offers VANs even greater\n   business opportunities.  General purpose Internet\
    \ Service Providers\n   (ISPs) do not typically offer EDI specific services, but\
    \ they can\n   provide an alternative means to transfer EDI messages at a small\n\
    \   fraction of the cost of typical EDI VANs.\n   The impact of an organization's\
    \ moving EDI onto the Internet,\n   independent of a VAN, is more difficult to\
    \ assess.  In the view of\n   some, the introduction of the Internet in the near\
    \ term (1-5 years)\n   adds additional interfaces and complexity to the organization's\n\
    \   existing EDI environment.  This may in the short term increase costs\n   and\
    \ raise new costs.  But a corporate commitment to an open systems\n   environment\
    \ through the use of Internet Protocols offers the\n   potential for a greater\
    \ interoperability, integration of application\n   systems, and therefore the\
    \ promise of higher performance and lower\n   costs.  Some organizations will\
    \ be able to get to these benefits\n   others will pay for a set of largely incompatible\
    \ services.  The\n   return on investment largely depends on one's ability to\
    \ consider EDI\n   on the Internet as a part of the organization's overall information\n\
    \   systems strategy and the organization's plans for a presence on the\n   Internet.\n"

  - "8.1.  What security measures are needed to connect to the Internet ?\n   Internet\
    \ security measures can be placed in two broad categories:\n   protecting your\
    \ system from intruders and protecting the content and\n   integrity of your messages.\
    \  With respect to the latter, EC/EDI\n   transactions of nominal value and sensitivity\
    \ do not require special\n   security requirements.  However, if the information\
    \ has any sensitive\n   aspects, you will need to take measures discussed below.\
    \  Competitors\n   might intercept your bids and undercut your proposal.  Or they\
    \ could\n   monitor your purchases and shipping notices to determine your firm's\n\
    \   production capacity.  To ensure confidentiality of the message, your\n   e-mail\
    \ system should offer some means of encrypting the message in a\n   manner only\
    \ the intended recipient can read.  Trading partners are\n   responsible for satisfying\
    \ existing rules and regulations relating to\n   computer security and privacy.\
    \  For example, bid data received by\n   government systems is subject to the\
    \ appropriate controls.  Trading\n   partner financial account data is likewise\
    \ subject to disclosure\n   restrictions.  To thwart those who might tamper with\
    \ a message to\n   divert delivery by changing the \"ship-to\" address, digital\
    \ signatures\n   can attest to the integrity of the message.  Digital signatures\
    \ can\n   also authenticate messages, preventing pranksters or rivals from\n \
    \  submitting false orders.\n"

    \ In the absence of such an\n   infrastructure, the encryption protocol and the\
    \ public keys would\n   need to be exchanged bilaterally, such as part of the\

    \ additional infrastructure and support systems.  The US government\n   is taking\
    \ steps to ensure the admissibility in court of such systems.\n   We anticipate\
    \ that the necessary regulatory and legal infrastructure\n   will be in place\
    \ about the same time as the necessary directory and\n   certificate services\
    \ and other supporting systems come on-line.  We\n   expect to see expansion of\
