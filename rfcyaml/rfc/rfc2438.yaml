  contents:
  - "2. Abstract\n   The Internet Standards Process [1] requires that all IETF Standards\n\
    \   Track specifications must have \"multiple, independent, and\n   interoperable\
    \ implementations\" before they can be advanced beyond\n   Proposed Standard status.\
    \  This document specifies the process which\n   the IESG will use to determine\
    \ if a MIB specification document meets\n   these requirements.  It also discusses\
    \ the rationale for this\n   process.\n"
- title: 3. The Nature of the Problem
  contents:
  - "3. The Nature of the Problem\n   The Internet Standards Process [1] requires\
    \ that for an IETF\n   specification to advance beyond the Proposed Standard level,\
    \ at least\n   two genetically unrelated implementations must be shown to\n  \
    \ interoperate correctly with all features and options. There are two\n   distinct\
    \ reasons for this requirement.\n   The first reason is to verify that the text\
    \ of the specification is\n   adequately clear and accurate.  This is demonstrated\
    \ by showing that\n   multiple implementation efforts have used the specification\
    \ to\n   achieved interoperable implementations.\n   The second reason is to discourage\
    \ excessive options and \"feature\n   creep\". This is accomplished by requiring\
    \ interoperable\n   implementation of all features, including options.  If an\
    \ option is\n   not included in at least two different interoperable implementations,\n\
    \   it is safe to assume that it has not been deemed useful and must be\n   removed\
    \ before the specification can advance.\n   In the case of a protocol specification\
    \ which specifies the \"bits on\n   the wire\" exchanged by executing state machines,\
    \ the notion of\n   \"interoperability\" is reasonably intuitive - the implementations\
    \ must\n   successfully \"talk to each other\", exchanging \"bits on the wire\"\
    ,\n   while exercising all features and options.\n   In the case of an SNMP Management\
    \ Information Base (MIB)\n   specification, exactly what constitutes \"interoperation\"\
    \ is less\n   obvious.  This document specifies how the IESG has decided to judge\n\
    \   \"MIB specification interoperability\" in the context of the IETF\n   Standards\
    \ Process.\n   There are a number of plausible interpretations of MIB specification\n\
    \   interoperability, many of which have merit but which have very\n   different\
    \ costs and difficulties in realization.\n   The aim is to ensure that the dual\
    \ goals of specification clarity and\n   feature evaluation have been met using\
    \ an interpretation of the\n   concept of MIB specification interoperability that\
    \ strikes a balance\n   between testing complexity and practicality.\n"
- title: 4. On The Nature of MIB specifications
  contents:
  - "4. On The Nature of MIB specifications\n   Compared to \"state machine\" protocols\
    \ which focus on procedural\n   specifications, a MIB specification is much more\
    \ data oriented.  To\n   over-generalize, in a typical MIB specification the collection\
    \ of\n   data type and instance specifications outnumbers inter-object\n   procedural\
    \ or causal semantics by a significant amount.\n   A central issue is that a MIB\
    \ specification does not stand alone; it\n   forms the access interface to the\
    \ instrumentation underneath it.\n   Without the instrumentation, a MIB has form\
    \ but no values.  Coupled\n   with the large number of objects even in a simple\
    \ MIB specification,\n   a MIB specification tends to have more of the look and\
    \ feel of an API\n   or a dictionary than a state machine protocol.\n   It is\
    \ important to distinguish between assessing the interoperability\n   of applications\
    \ which may use or interact with MIBs, and the MIBs\n   themselves.  It is fairly\
    \ obvious that \"black-box testing\" can be\n   applied to such applications and\
    \ that the approach enjoys a certain\n   maturity in the software engineering\
    \ arts.  A MIB specification, on\n   the other hand is not readily amenable to\
    \ black box test plans.\n"
- title: 5. Discussion and Recommended Process
  contents:
  - "5. Discussion and Recommended Process\n   In order to meet their obligations\
    \ under the IETF Standards Process,\n   the Operations and Management Area Directors\
    \ and the IESG must be\n   convinced that each MIB specification advanced to Draft\
    \ Standard or\n   Internet Standard status is clearly written, that there are\
    \ the\n   required multiple interoperable implementations, and that all options\n\
    \   have been implemented.  There are multiple ways to achieve this goal.\n  \
    \ Appendix A lists some testing approaches that could be used when\n   attempting\
    \ to document multiple implementations.\n   The Full Coverage or Stimulus-Response\
    \ approaches are very through,\n   and would increase confidence that the requirement\
    \ has been met, if\n   applied.  However, experience in real-world software engineering\n\
    \   makes it clear that such confidence comes at an extremely high price;\n  \
    \ even with the most exhaustive testing, it is often not clear what\n   precisely\
    \ has been demonstrated by such testing.  We believe that\n   both of those standards\
    \ of evidence are materially beyond what can be\n   reasonably accomplished in\
    \ an operational sense, and achieving the\n   requisite semantic specifications\
    \ are even more unlikely.\n   Therefore, the Operations and Management Area and\
    \ the IESG have\n   adopted a more pragmatic approach to determining the suitability\
    \ of a\n   MIB specification for advancement on the standards track beyond\n \
    \  Proposed Standard status.  Each MIB specification suggested for\n   advancement\
    \ must have one or more advocates who can make a convincing\n   argument that\
    \ the MIB specification meets the multiple implementation\n   and feature support\
    \ requirements of the IETF Standards Process.  The\n   specific way to make the\
    \ argument is left to the advocate, but will\n   normally include reports that\
    \ basic object comparison testing has\n   been done.\n   Thus any recommendation\
    \ for the advancement of a MIB specification\n   must be accompanied by an implementation\
    \ report, as is the case with\n   all requests for the advancement of IETF specifications.\
    \  The\n   implementation report must include the reasons why the IESG should\n\
    \   believe that there are multiple implementations of the MIB\n   specification\
    \ in question and that the all of the MIB objects in the\n   specification to\
    \ be advanced are supported in more than one\n   implementation.  But note that\
    \ the prime concern of the IESG will be\n   that the underlying reasons for the\
    \ interoperable implementations are\n   met, i.e., that the text of the specification\
    \ is clear and\n   unambiguous, and that features of the specification which have\
    \ not\n   garnered support have been removed.\n   The implementation report will\
    \ be placed on the IETF web page along\n   with the other pre-advancement implementation\
    \ reports and will be\n   specifically referred to in the IETF Last-Call.  As\
    \ with all such\n   implementation reports, the determination of adequacy is made\
    \ by the\n   Area Director(s) of the relevant IETF Area.  This determination of\n\
    \   adequacy can be challenged during the Last-Call period.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   Some may view this policy as possibly leading\
    \ to a reduction in the\n   level of confidence people can have in MIB specifications\
    \ but the O&M\n   Area Directors and the IESG feel that it will adequately ensure\
    \ a\n   reasonable evaluation of the level of clarity of MIB specifications\n\
    \   and to ensure that unused options can be identified and removed\n   before\
    \ the advancement of a specification.\n   Good, clearly written MIB specifications\
    \ can be of great assistance\n   in the management of the Internet and other networks\
    \ and thus assist\n   in the reduction of some types of security threats.\n"

- title: A. Some Testing Alternatives
  contents:
  - "A. Some Testing Alternatives\n   The IESG debated a number of interoperability\
    \ and testing models in\n   formulating this specification.  The following list\
    \ is not an\n   exhaustive enumeration of the alternatives, but it does capture\
    \ the\n   major plausible models which were examined in the course of the\n  \
    \ discussion.\n"
- title: A.1 Basic Object Comparison
  contents:
  - "A.1 Basic Object Comparison\n   Assume the requisite two genetically unrelated\
    \ implementations of the\n   MIB in an SNMP agent and an SNMP management station\
    \ which can do a\n   \"MIB Dump\" (extract the complete set of MIB object types\
    \ and values\n   from the agent implementation).  Extract a MIB Dump from each\n\
    \   implementation and compare the two dumps to verify that both provide\n   the\
    \ complete set of mandatory and optional objects and that the\n   individual objects\
    \ are of the correct types.\n"
- title: A.2 Stimulus/Response Testing
  contents:
  - "A.2 Stimulus/Response Testing\n   Proceed as in A.1, but in addition, comprehensively\
    \ exercise the two\n   (network) elements containing the agent implementations\
    \ to verify\n   that all the MIB objects reflect plausible values in operational\n\
    \   conditions.  An even stricter interpretation would require that the\n   MIB\
    \ objects in the two network elements track identically given the\n   identical\
    \ stimulus.  While this would test \"read-only\" or\n   \"monitoring\" information\
    \ obtained from the underlying\n   instrumentation, it is important to observe\
    \ that such instrumentation\n   is actually an *application* which uses the MIB\
    \ and is not part of\n   the MIB itself.\n"
- title: A.3 Full Coverage Testing
  contents:
  - "A.3 Full Coverage Testing\n   This model extends the notion of Stimulus/Response\
    \ Testing to its\n   logical extreme. The MIB is viewed as an API and the software\n\
    \   engineering notion of full coverage testing is applied to a MIB.\n   This\
    \ involves exercising all paths through the causal semantics and\n   verifying\
    \ that all objects change state correctly in all cases.\n   Again, note that much\
    \ more than the MIB definition is being exercised\n   and evaluated.\n"
