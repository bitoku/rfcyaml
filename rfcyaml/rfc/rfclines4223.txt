Abstract This memo reclassifies RFC 1863,
A BGP/IDRP Route Server alternative to a full mesh routing, to Historic status.
This memo also obsoletes RFC 1863.
Reclassification of RFC 1863 to Historic RFC 1863 [1] describes the use of route servers as an alternative to BGP/IDRP full mesh routing.
In the context of this document, the term "RFC 1863 route server" is used to refer to a route server as specified in RFC 1863.
Other uses of the term "route server" are outside the scope of this document.
Implementations of RFC 1863 route servers do not exist and are not used as an alternative to full mesh routing.
Therefore, RFC 1863 is reclassified to Historic status.
Current techniques that serve as an alternative to full mesh routing include BGP Route Reflectors [2], BGP Confederedations [3], and the use of private AS numbers.
IDRP for IP has never been standardized by the IETF and can be considered obsolete.
Other uses of (non RFC1863) route servers, rather than as an alternative to full mesh routing as described by RFC 1863, are expected to continue to be used for multiple purposes, but are out of the scope of this memo.
Security Considerations Reclassifying RFC 1863 has no security considerations.
