- title: 1.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   o   An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [1].\n   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of\n\
    \       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD\n  \
    \     16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].  The\n       second\
    \ version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578\n       [5], STD 58,\
    \ RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].\n   o   Message protocols for transferring\
    \ management information. The\n       first version of the SNMP message protocol\
    \ is called SNMPv1 and\n       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version\
    \ of the SNMP\n       message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n\
    \       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC\n  \
    \     1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is called\n      \
    \ SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574\n       [12].\n\
    \   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The\n      \
    \ first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n       described\
    \ in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol\n       operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n       [13].\n   o   A set of fundamental\
    \ applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and\n       the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2575\n       [15].\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in\
    \ the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.\
    \ A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n\
    \   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent,\
    \ except where objects or events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible\
    \ (use of Counter64). Some machine readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be converted\
    \ into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process. However,\
    \ this loss of machine\n   readable information is not considered to change the\
    \ semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Structure of the MIB
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Structure of the MIB\n   This MIB is structured into seven groups:\n  \
    \    o    The docsDevBase group extends the MIB-II 'system' group with\n     \
    \      objects needed for cable device system management.\n      o    The docsDevNmAccessGroup\
    \ provides a minimum level of SNMP\n           access security (see Section 3\
    \ of [18]).\n      o    The docsDevSoftware group provides information for network-\n\
    \           downloadable software upgrades.  See \"Handling of Software\n    \
    \       Upgrades\" below..\n      o    The docsDevServer group provides information\
    \ about the\n           progress of the interaction between the CM or CMTS and\n\
    \           various provisioning servers.\n      o    The docsDevEvent group provides\
    \ control and logging for event\n           reporting.\n      o    The docsDevFilter\
    \ group configures filters at link layer and\n           IP layer for bridged\
    \ data traffic.  This group consists of a\n           link-layer filter table,\
    \ docsDevFilterLLCTable, which is used\n           to manage the processing and\
    \ forwarding of non-IP traffic; an\n           IP packet classifier table, docsDevFilterIpTable,\
    \ which is\n           used to map classes of packets to specific policy actions;\
    \ a\n           policy table, docsDevFilterPolicyTable, which maps zero or\n \
    \          more policy actions onto a specific packet classification,\n      \
    \     and one or more policy action tables.\n           At this time, this MIB\
    \ specifies only one policy action\n           table, docsDevFilterTosTable, which\
    \ allows the manipulation\n           of the type of services bits in an IP packet\
    \ based on\n           matching some criteria.  The working group may add additional\n\
    \           policy types and action tables in the future, for example to\n   \
    \        allow QOS to modem service identifier assignment based on\n         \
    \  destination.\n      o    The docsDevCpe group provides control over which IP\
    \ addresses\n           may be used by customer premises equipment (e.g. PCs)\n\
    \           serviced by a given cable modem.  This provides anti-spoofing\n  \
    \         control at the point of origin for a large cable modem\n           system.\
    \  This group is separate from docsDevFilter primarily\n           as this group\
    \ is only implemented on the Cable Modem (CM) and\n           MUST NOT be implemented\
    \ on the Cable Modem Termination System\n           (CMTS).\n"

- title: 3.2.1.  Handling of Software upgrades
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Handling of Software upgrades\n   The Cable Modem software upgrade process\
    \ is documented in [16].  From\n   a network management station, the operator:\n\
    \      o    sets docsDevSwServer to the address of the TFTP server for\n     \
    \      software upgrades\n      o    sets docsDevSwFilename to the file pathname\
    \ of the software\n           upgrade image\n      o    sets docsDevSwAdminStatus\
    \ to upgrade-from-mgt\n   One reason for the SNMP-initiated upgrade is to allow\
    \ loading of a\n   temporary software image (e.g., special diagnostic software)\
    \ that\n   differs from the software normally used on that device without\n  \
    \ changing the provisioning database.\n   Note that software upgrades should not\
    \ be accepted blindly by the\n   cable device. The cable device may refuse an\
    \ upgrade if:\n      o    The download is incomplete.\n      o    The file contents\
    \ are incomplete or damaged.\n      o    The software is not intended for that\
    \ hardware device (may\n           include the case of a feature set that has\
    \ not been purchased\n           for this device).\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Events and Traps
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Events and Traps\n   This MIB provides control facilities for reporting\
    \ events through\n   syslog, traps, and non-volatile logging.  If events are reported\n\
    \   through traps, the specified conventions must be followed.  Other\n   means\
    \ of event reporting are outside the scope of this document.\n   The definition\
    \ and coding of events is vendor-specific.  In deference\n   to the network operator\
    \ who must troubleshoot multi-vendor networks,\n   the circumstances and meaning\
    \ of each event should be reported as\n   human-readable text.  Vendors SHOULD\
    \ provide time-of-day clocks in\n   CMs to provide useful timestamping of events.\n\
    \   For each vendor-specific event that is reportable via TRAP, the\n   vendor\
    \ must create an enterprise-specific trap definition.  Trap\n   definitions MUST\
    \ include the event reason encoded as DisplayString\n   and should be defined\
    \ as:\n   trapName NOTIFICATION-TYPE\n           OBJECTS {\n               ifIndex,\n\
    \               eventReason,\n               other useful objects\n          \

    \ defined trap might be:\n   xyzVendorModemDropout NOTIFICATION-TYPE\n       \
    \    OBJECTS {\n               eventReason,\n               xyzModemHighWatermarkCount\n\

    \    \"Sent by a CMTS when a configurable number of modems\n           (xyzModemHysteresis)\

    \ to correlate the event type to the trap type.  Many\n   Network Management systems\
    \ are only capable of trap filtering on an\n   enterprise and single-last-digit\
    \ basis.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  Trap Throttling
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Trap Throttling\n   The CM and CMTS MUST provide support for trap message\
    \ throttling as\n   described below.  The network operator can employ message\
    \ rate\n   throttling or trap limiting by manipulating the appropriate MIB\n \
    \  variables.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.1.  Trap rate throttling
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.1.  Trap rate throttling\n   Network operators may employ either of two\
    \ rate control methods.  In\n   the first method, the device ceases to send traps\
    \ when the rate\n   exceeds the specified maximum message rate.  It resumes sending\
    \ traps\n   only if reactivated by a network management station request.\n   In\
    \ the second method, the device resumes sending traps when the rate\n   falls\
    \ below the specified maximum message rate.\n   The network operator configures\
    \ the specified maximum message rate by\n   setting the measurement interval (in\
    \ seconds), and the maximum number\n   of traps to be transmitted within the measurement\
    \ interval.  The\n   operator can query the operational throttling state (to determine\n\
    \   whether traps are enabled or blocked by throttling) of the device, as\n  \
    \ well as query and set the administrative throttling state (to manage\n   the\
    \ rate control method) of the device.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.2.  Limiting the trap rate
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.2.  Limiting the trap rate\n   Network operators may wish to limit the\
    \ number of traps sent by a\n   device over a specified time period.  The device\
    \ ceases to send traps\n   when the number of traps exceeds the specified threshold.\
    \  It resumes\n   sending traps only when the measurement interval has passed.\n\
    \   The network operator defines the maximum number of traps he is\n   willing\
    \ to handle and sets the measurement interval to a large number\n   (in hundredths\
    \ of a second).  For this case, the administrative\n   throttling state is set\
    \ to stop at threshold which is the maximum\n   number of traps.\n   See \"Techniques\
    \ for Managing Asynchronously Generated Alerts\" [17]\n   for further information.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Protocol Filters
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Protocol Filters\n   The Cable Device MIB provides objects for both LLC\
    \ and IP protocol\n   filters.  The LLC protocol filter entries can be used to\
    \ limit CM\n   forwarding to a restricted set of network-layer protocols (such\
    \ as\n   IP, IPX, NetBIOS, and Appletalk).\n   The IP protocol filter entries\
    \ can be used to restrict upstream or\n   downstream traffic based on source and\
    \ destination IP addresses,\n   transport-layer protocols (such as TCP, UDP, and\
    \ ICMP), and source\n   and destination TCP/UDP port numbers.\n   In general,\
    \ a cable modem applies filters (or more properly,\n   classifiers) in an order\
    \ appropriate to the layering model.\n   Specifically, the inbound MAC (or LLC)\
    \ layer filters are applied\n   first, then the \"special\" filters, then the\
    \ IP layer inbound filters,\n   then the IP layer outbound filters, then any final\
    \ LLC outbound\n   filters.  Since the cable modem does not generally do any IP\n\

    \ source address\n   of the IP packet must match at least one IP address in this\
    \ table or\n   it is discarded without further processing.\n   The table can be\
    \ automatically populated where the first N different\n   IP addresses seen from\

    \  The spoofing filters are specified\n   in the docsDevCpeTable and the policy\

  - "3.3.2.2.  SNMP Access Filters - docsDevNmAccessTable\n   The SNMP access filters\
    \ are applied to SNMP packets entering from any\n   interface and destined for\
    \ the cable modem.  If the packets enter\n   from a CPE interface, the SNMP filters\
    \ are applied after the IP\n   spoofing filters.  The filters only apply to SNMPv1\
    \ or SNMPv2c\n   traffic, and are not consulted for SNMPv3 traffic (and need not\

    \   in the User Security Model MIB in [12].\n"
- title: 3.3.3.  IP Filtering - docsDevIpFilterTable
  contents:
  - "3.3.3.  IP Filtering - docsDevIpFilterTable\n   The IP Filtering table acts as\
    \ a classifier table.  Each row in the\n   table describes a template against\
    \ which IP packets are compared.\n   The template includes source and destination\
    \ addresses (and their\n   associated masks), upper level protocol (e.g. TCP,\
    \ UDP), source and\n   destination port ranges, TOS and TOS mask. A row also contains\n\
    \   interface and traffic direction match values which have to be\n   considered\
    \ in combination.  All columns of a particular row must\n   match the appropriate\
    \ fields in the packet, and must match the\n   interface and direction items for\
    \ the packet to result in a match to\n   the packet.\n   When classifying a packet,\
    \ the table is scanned beginning with the\n   lowest number filter.  If the agent\
    \ finds a match, it applies the\n   group of policies specified.  If the matched\
    \ filter has the continue\n   bit set, the agent continues the scan possibly matching\
    \ additional\n   filters and applying additional policies.  This allows the agent\
    \ to\n   take one set of actions for the 24.0.16/255.255.255.0 group and one\n\
    \   set of actions for telnet packets to/from 24.0.16.30 and these sets\n   of\
    \ actions may not be mutually exclusive.\n   Once a packet is matched, one of\
    \ three actions happen based on the\n   setting of docsDevFilterIpControl in the\
    \ row.  The packet may be\n   dropped, in which case no further processing is\
    \ required.  The packet\n   may be accepted and processing of the packet continues.\
    \  Lastly, the\n   packet may have a set of policy actions applied to it.  If\n\
    \   docsDevFilterIpContinue is set to true, scanning of the table\n   continues\
    \ and additional matches may result.\n   When a packet matches, and docsDevFilterIpControl\
    \ in the filter\n   matched is set to 'policy', the value of docsDevFilterIpPolicyId\
    \ is\n   used as a selector into the docsDevFilterPolicyTable.  The first\n  \
    \ level of indirection may result in zero or more actions being taken\n   based\
    \ on the match.  The docsDevFilterPolicyTable is scanned in row\n   order and\
    \ all rows where docsDevFilterPolicyId equals\n   docsDevFilterIpPolicyId have\
    \ the action specified by\n   docsDevFilterPolicyValue 'executed'.  For example,\
    \ a value pointing\n   to an entry in the docsDevFilterTosTable may result in\
    \ the re-writing\n   of the TOS bits in the IP packet which was matched.  Another\n\
    \   possibility may be to assign an output packet to a specific output\n   upstream\
    \ queue.  An even more complex action might be to re-write the\n   TOS value,\
    \ assign the packet to an upstream service ID, and drop it\n   into a particular\
    \ IPSEC tunnel.\n   Example:\n   docsDevFilterIpTable\n   #  Index,  SrcIP/Mask,\
    \ DstIP/Mask,ULP, SrcPts,DstPts,Tos/Mask,\n   # Int/Dir,  Pgroup, [continue]\n\
    \   # drop any netbios traffic\n   10, 0/0, 0/0, TCP, any, 137-139, 0/0, any/any,\

    \ on to special upstream traffic queues and for the \"gold\"\n   service results\
    \ in having the packets marked with a TOS of 5.  The\n   10, 20, 60 and 65 entries\
    \ are generic entries that would generally be\n   applied to all traffic to this\
    \ CM.  The 30, 40 and 45 entries are\n   specific to a particular CPE's service\
    \ assignments.  The ordering\n   here is a bit contrived, but is close to what\
    \ may actually be\n   required by the operator to control various classes of customers.\n"

    \ that the QOS\n   additions to the DOCSIS standard may include some outbound\

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB relates to a system which will provide\
    \ metropolitan public\n   internet access.  As such, improper manipulation of\
    \ the objects\n   represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a\
    \ large\n   number of end-users.  In addition, manipulation of the\n   docsDevNmAccessTable,\
    \ docsDevFilterLLCTable, docsDevFilterIpTable and\n   the elements of the docsDevCpe\
    \ group may allow an end-user to\n   increase their service levels, spoof their\
    \ IP addresses, change the\n   permitted management stations, or affect other\
    \ end-users in either a\n   positive or negative manner.\n   There are a number\
    \ of management objects defined in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause\
    \ of read-write and/or read-create.  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive\
    \ or vulnerable in some network\n   environments.  The support for SET operations\
    \ in a non-secure\n   environment without proper protection can have a negative\
    \ effect on\n   network operations.  In addition to those mentioned above:\n \
    \  o    The use of docsDevNmAccessTable to specify management stations\n     \
    \   is considered to be only limited protection and does not protect\n       \
    \ against attacks which spoof the management station's IP address.\n        The\
    \ use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be\n        considered\
    \ where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM\n        MUST be used with\
    \ any v3 agent which implements this MIB.\n        Administrators may also wish\
    \ to consider whether even read\n        access to docsDevNmAccessTable may be\
    \ undesirable under certain\n        circumstances.\n   o    The CM may have its\
    \ software changed by the actions of the\n        management system.  An improper\
    \ software load may result in\n        substantial vulnerabilities and the loss\
    \ of the ability of the\n        management system to control the cable modem.\n\
    \   o    The device may be reset by setting docsDevResetNow = true(1).\n     \
    \   This causes the device to reload its configuration files as well\n       \
    \ as eliminating all previous non-persistent network management\n        settings.\
    \ As such, this may provide a vector for attacking the\n        system.\n   o\
    \    Setting docsDevEvThrottleAdminStatus = unconstrained(1) (which\n        is\
    \ also the DEFVAL) may cause flooding of traps, which can\n        disrupt network\
    \ service.\n   This MIB does not affect confidentiality of services on a cable\
    \ modem\n   system.  [20] specifies the implementation of the DOCSIS Baseline\n\
    \   privacy mechanism.  The working group expects to issue a MIB for the\n   management\
    \ of this mechanism at a later time.\n   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.\
    \  Even if the network\n   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even\
    \ then, there is no\n   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\
    \ access and\n   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.\n\
    \   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security\n   features\
    \ as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use\n   of the User-based\
    \ Security Model [12]  and the View-based Access\n   Control Model [15] is recommended.\n\
    \   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity\
    \ giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly\n   configured to give\
    \ access to the objects only to those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate\
    \ rights to indeed GET or SET\n   (change/create/delete) them.\n"
