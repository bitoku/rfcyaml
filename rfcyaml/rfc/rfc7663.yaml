  - "Abstract\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) through its IP Stack Evolution\n\
    \   program, the Internet Society, and the Swiss Federal Institute of\n   Technology\
    \ (ETH) Zurich hosted the Stack Evolution in a Middlebox\n   Internet (SEMI) workshop\
    \ in Zurich on 26-27 January 2015 to explore\n   the ability to evolve the transport\
    \ layer in the presence of\n   middlebox- and interface-related ossification of\
    \ the stack.  The goal\n   of the workshop was to produce architectural and engineering\
    \ guidance\n   on future work to break the logjam, focusing on incrementally\n\
    \   deployable approaches with clear incentives to deployment both on the\n  \
    \ endpoints (in new transport layers and applications) as well as on\n   middleboxes\
    \ (run by network operators).  This document summarizes the\n   contributions\
    \ to the workshop and provides an overview of the\n   discussion at the workshop,\
    \ as well as the outcomes and next steps\n   identified by the workshop.  The\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The transport layer of the Internet has become ossified,\
    \ squeezed\n   between narrow interfaces (from BSD sockets to pseudo-transport\
    \ over\n   HTTPS) and increasing in-network modification of traffic by\n   middleboxes\
    \ that make assumptions about the protocols running through\n   them.  This ossification\
    \ makes it difficult to innovate in the\n   transport layer, through the deployment\
    \ of new protocols or the\n   extension of existing ones.  At the same time, emerging\
    \ applications\n   require functionality that existing protocols can provide only\n\
    \   inefficiently, if at all.\n   To begin to address this problem, the IAB, within\
    \ the scope of its IP\n   Stack Evolution Program, organized a workshop to discuss\
    \ approaches\n   to de-ossify transport, especially with respect to interactions\
    \ with\n   middleboxes and new methods for implementing transport protocols.\n\
    \   Recognizing that the end-to-end principle has long been compromised,\n   we\
    \ start with the fundamental question of matching paths through the\n   Internet\
    \ with certain characteristics to application and transport\n   requirements.\n\
    \   We posed the following questions in the call for papers: Which paths\n   through\
    \ the Internet are actually available to applications?  Which\n   transports can\
    \ be used over these paths?  How can applications\n   cooperate with network elements\
    \ to improve path establishment and\n   discovery?  Can common transport functionality\
    \ and standardization\n   help application developers to implement and deploy\
    \ such approaches\n   in today's Internet?  Could cooperative approaches give\
    \ us a way to\n   rebalance the Internet back toward its end-to-end roots?\n \
    \  The call for papers encouraged a focus on approaches that are\n   incrementally\
    \ deployable within the present Internet.  Identified\n   topics included the\
    \ following:\n   o  Development and deployment of transport-like features in\n\
    \      application-layer protocols\n   o  Methods for discovery of path characteristics\
    \ and protocol\n      availability along a path\n   o  Methods for middlebox detection\
    \ and characterization of middlebox\n      behavior and functionality\n   o  Methods\
    \ for NAT and middlebox traversal in the establishment of\n      end-to-end paths\n\
    \   o  Mechanisms for cooperative path-endpoint signaling, and lessons\n     \
    \ learned from existing approaches\n   o  Economic considerations and incentives\
    \ for cooperation in\n      middlebox deployment\n   The Internet Architecture\
    \ Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops\n   designed to consider long-term issues\
    \ and strategies for the\n   Internet, and to suggest future directions for the\
    \ Internet\n   architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is\n\
    \   complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working\n  \
    \ groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), under the\n   leadership\
    \ of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and area\n   directorates.\n\
    \   The SEMI workshop followed in part from the IAB's longer term\n   interest\
    \ in the evolution of the Internet and the adoption of\n   Internet protocols,\
    \ including the Internet Technology Adoption and\n   Transition workshop [RFC7305],\
    \ \"What Makes for a Successful Protocol\"\n   [RFC5218], back to Deering's plenary\
    \ talk [deering-plenary] at IETF\n   51 in 2001.\n"

  - "1.1.  Organization of This Report\n   This workshop report summarizes the contributions\
    \ to, and discussions\n   at the workshop, organized by topic.  We started with\
    \ a summary of\n   the current situation with respect to stack ossification, and\n\
    \   explored the incentives that have made it that way and the role of\n   incentives\
    \ in evolution.  Many contributions were broadly split into\n   two areas: middlebox\
    \ measurement, classification, and approaches to\n   defense against middlebox\
    \ modification of packets; and approaches to\n   support transport evolution.\
    \  All accepted position papers and\n   detailed transcripts of discussion are\
    \ available at\n   https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/semi/.\n   The outcomes\

- title: 2.  The Situation in Review
  contents:
  - "2.  The Situation in Review\n   At the time of Deering's talk in 2001, network\
    \ address translation\n   (NAT) was identified as the key challenge to the Internet\n\
    \   architecture.  Since then, the NAT traversal problem has been largely\n  \
    \ solved, but the boxes in the middle are getting smarter and more\n   varied.\n\
    \   SEMI, as the IP Stack Evolution program in general, is far from the\n   first\
    \ attempt to solve the problems caused by middlebox interference\n   in the end-to-end\
    \ model.  Just within the IETF, the MIDCOM, NSIS, and\n   BEHAVE efforts have\
    \ addressed this problem, and the TRAM working\n   group is updating the NAT traversal\
    \ outcomes of MIDCOM to reflect\n   current reality.\n   We believe we have an\
    \ opportunity to improve the situation in the\n   present, however, due to a convergence\
    \ of forces.  While the tussle\n   between security and middleboxes is not new,\
    \ the accelerating\n   deployment of cryptography for integrity and confidentiality\
    \ makes\n   many packet inspection and packet modification operations obsolete,\n\
    \   creating pressure to improve the situation.  There is also new energy\n  \
    \ in the IETF around work that requires transport-layer flexibility\n   we're\
    \ not sure we have (e.g., WebRTC) as well as flexibility at the\n   transport\
    \ interface (TAPS).\n"
- title: 3.  Incentives for Stack Ossification and Evolution
  contents:
  - "3.  Incentives for Stack Ossification and Evolution\n   The current situation\
    \ is, of course, the result of a variety of\n   processes, and the convergence\
    \ of incentives for network operators,\n   content providers, network equipment\
    \ vendors, application developers,\n   operating system developers, and end users.\
    \  Moore's Law makes it\n   easier to deploy more processing on-path, network\
    \ operators need to\n   find ways to add value, enterprises find it more scalable\
    \ to deploy\n   functionality in-network than on endpoints, and middleboxes are\n\
    \   something vendors can vend.  These trends increase ossification of\n   the\
    \ network stack.\n   Any effort to reduce the resulting ossification in order\
    \ to make it\n   easier to evolve the transport stack, then, must consider the\n\
    \   incentives to deployment of new approaches by each of these actors.\n   As\
    \ Christian Huitema [huitema-semi] pointed out, encryption provides\n   a powerful\
    \ incentive here: putting a transport protocol atop a\n   cryptographic protocol\
    \ atop UDP resets the transport versus middlebox\n   tussle by making inspection\
    \ and modification above the encryption and\n   demux layer impossible.  Any transport\
    \ evolution strategy using this\n   approach must also deliver better performance\
    \ or functionality (e.g.,\n   setup latency) than existing approaches while being\
    \ as deployable as\n   these approaches, or moreso.\n   Indeed, significant positive\
    \ net value at each organization where\n   change is required -- operators, application\
    \ developers, equipment\n   vendors, enterprise and private users -- is best to\
    \ drive deployment\n   of a new protocol, said Dave Thaler, pointing to [RFC5218].\
    \  All\n   tussles in networking stem from conflicting incentives unavoidable\
    \ in\n   a free market.  For upper-layer protocols, incentives tend to favor\n\
    \   protocols that work anywhere, use the most efficient mechanism that\n   works,\
    \ and are as simple as possible from an implementation,\n   maintenance, and management\
    \ standpoint.  For lower-layer protocols,\n   incentives tend toward ignoring\
    \ and or disabling optional features,\n   as there is a positive feedback cycle\
    \ between being rarely used and\n   rarely implemented.\n"
- title: 4.  The Role and Rule of Middleboxes
  contents:
  - "4.  The Role and Rule of Middleboxes\n   Middleboxes are commonplace in the Internet\
    \ and constrain the ability\n   to deploy new protocols and protocol extensions.\
    \  Engineering around\n   this problem requires a \"bestiary\" of middleboxes,\
    \ a classification\n   of which kinds of impairments middleboxes cause and how\
    \ often,\n   according to Benoit Donnet [edeline-semi].\n   Even though the trend\
    \ towards Network Function Visualization (NFV)\n   allows for faster update-cycle\
    \ of middleboxes and thereby more\n   flexibility, the function provided by middleboxes\
    \ will stay.  In\n   fact, service chaining may lead to more and more add-ons\
    \ to address\n   and manage problems in the network, in turn further increasing\
    \ the\n   complexity of network management.  Ted Hardie [hardie-semi] warned\n\
    \   that each instance may add a new queue and may increase the\n   bufferbloat\
    \ problem that is counterproductive for new emerging\n   latency-sensitive applications.\
    \  However, this new flexibility also\n   provides a chance to move functionality\
    \ back to the end host.\n   Alternately, more appropriate in-network functionality\
    \ could benefit\n   from additional information in application and path characteristics,\n\
    \   though this in turn implies a variety of complicated trust\n   relationships\
    \ among nodes in the network.  In any case, an increasing\n   trend of in-network\
    \ functionality can be observed, especially in\n   mobile networks.\n   Costin\
    \ Raiciu [raiciu-semi] stated that middleboxes make the Internet\n   unpredictable,\
    \ leading to a trade-off between efficiency and\n   reachability.  While constructive\
    \ cooperation with middleboxes to\n   establish a clear contract between the network\
    \ and the endpoint might\n   be one approach to address this challenge, enforcement\
    \ of contract in\n   less cooperative environments might require extensive tunneling.\n\
    \   Raiciu's contribution on \"ninja tunneling\" illustrates one such\n   approach.\n"
- title: 5.  Evolving the Transport Layer
  contents:
  - "5.  Evolving the Transport Layer\n   For evolution in the transport layer itself,\
    \ various proposals have\n   been discussed, reaching from the development of\
    \ new protocols\n   (potentially as user-level stacks) encapsulated in UDP as\
    \ a transport\n   identification sub-header to the use of TCP as a substrate where\
    \ the\n   semantics of TCP are relaxed (e.g., regarding reliability, ordering,\n\
    \   flow control, etc.) and a more flexible API is provided to the\n   application.\n\
    \   Discussion on evolution during the workshop divided amicably along\n   two\
    \ lines: working to fix the deployability of TCP extensions\n   (referred to in\
    \ discussion as \"the TCP Liberation Front\") versus\n   working to build new\
    \ encapsulation-based mechanisms to allow wholly\n   new protocols to be deployed\
    \ (referred to in discussion as \"the\n   People's Front of UDP\").  David Black\
    \ [black-semi] pointed out that\n   UDP encapsulation has to be adapted and separately\
    \ discussed for\n   every use case, which can be a long and painful process. \
    \ UDP\n   encapsulation can be an approach to develop more specialized\n   protocols\
    \ that helps to address special needs of certain\n   applications.  However, Stuart\
    \ Cheshire [cheshire-semi] (as presented\n   by Brian Trammell) pointed out that\
    \ designing a new protocol instead\n   of fixing/extending TCP might not always\
    \ solve the problem.\n   To address the extensibility problem of TCP, Bob Briscoe\
    \ proposed\n   Inner Space [briscoe-semi].  Here, the general principle is to\
    \ extend\n   layer X's header within layer X+1; in the case of TCP, additional\
    \ TCP\n   header and option space is provided within the TCP payload, such that\n\
    \   it cannot presently be inspected and modified by middleboxes.\n   Further,\
    \ instead of only focusing on those cases where new extensions\n   and protocols\
    \ are not deployable, Micheal Welzl [welzl-semi] points\n   out that there are\
    \ also a lot of paths in the network that are not\n   ossified.  To enable deployment\
    \ on these paths, an end host would\n   need to probe or use a happy-eyeball-like\
    \ approach [RFC6555] and\n   potentially fallback.  The TAPS working group implements\
    \ the first\n   step to decouple applications from transport protocols allowing\
    \ for\n   the needed flexibility in the transport layer.\n"

  - "6.  Outcomes\n   The SEMI workshop identified several areas for further work,\
    \ outlined\n   below.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Minimal Signaling for Encapsulated Transports
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Minimal Signaling for Encapsulated Transports\n   Assuming that a way forward\
    \ for transport evolution in user space\n   would involve encapsulation in UDP\
    \ datagrams, the workshop identified\n   that it may be useful to have a facility\
    \ built atop UDP to provide\n   minimal signaling of the semantics of a flow that\
    \ would otherwise be\n   available in TCP: at the very least, indications of first\
    \ and last\n   packets in a flow to assist firewalls and NATs in policy decision\
    \ and\n   state maintenance.  This facility could also provide minimal\n   application-to-path\
    \ and path-to-application signaling, though there\n   was less agreement on exactly\
    \ what should or could be signaled here.\n   The workshop did note that, given\
    \ the increasing deployment of\n   encryption in the Internet, this facility should\
    \ cooperate with\n   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC6347] in order\
    \ to\n   selectively expose information about traffic flows where the\n   transport\
    \ headers and payload themselves are encrypted.\n   To develop this concept further,\
    \ it was decided to propose a BoF\n   session that would not form a working group,\
    \ SPUD (Substrate Protocol\n   for User Datagrams), at the IETF 92 meeting in\
    \ March in Dallas.  A\n   document on use cases [SPUD-USE], a prototype specification\
    \ for a\n   shim protocol over UDP [SPUD-PROTO], and a separate specification\
    \ of\n   the use of DTLS as a subtransport layer [TLS-DTLS] were prepared\n  \
    \ following discussions at SEMI and presented at the BoF.\n   Clear from discussion\
    \ before and during the SPUD BoF, and drawing on\n   experience with previous\
    \ endpoint-to-middle and middle-to-endpoint\n   signaling approaches, is that\
    \ any selective exposure of traffic\n   metadata outside a relatively restricted\
    \ trust domain must be\n   declarative as opposed to imperative, non-negotiated,\
    \ and advisory.\n   Each exposed parameter should also be independently verifiable,\
    \ so\n   that each entity can assign its own trust to other entities.  Basic\n\
    \   transport over the substrate must continue working even if signaling\n   is\
    \ ignored or stripped, to support incremental deployment.  These\n   restrictions\
    \ on vocabulary are discussed further in [EXP-COOP].\n   There was much interest\
    \ in the room in continuing work on an approach\n   like the one under discussion.\
    \  It was relatively clear that the\n   state of the discussion and prototyping\
    \ activity now is not yet\n   mature enough for standardization within an IETF\
    \ working group.  An\n   appropriate venue for continuing the work remains unclear.\n\
    \   Discussion continues on the spud mailing list (spud@ietf.org).  The\n   UDP\
    \ shim layer prototype is described by [SPUD-PROTO].\n"
- title: 6.2.  Middlebox Measurement
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Middlebox Measurement\n   Discussion about the impairments caused by middleboxes\
    \ quickly\n   identified the need to get more and better data about how prevalent\n\
    \   certain types of impairments are in the network.  It doesn't make\n   much\
    \ sense, for instance, to engineer complex workarounds for certain\n   types of\
    \ impairments into transport protocols if those impairments\n   are relatively\
    \ rare.  There are dedicated measurement studies for\n   certain types of impairment,\
    \ but the workshop noted that prevalence\n   data might be available from error\
    \ logs from TCP stacks and\n   applications on both clients and servers: these\
    \ entities are in a\n   position to know when attempts to use particular transport\
    \ features\n   failed, providing an opportunity to measure the network as a side\n\
    \   effect of using it.  Many clients already have a feature for sending\n   these\
    \ bug reports back to their developers.  These present\n   opportunities to bring\
    \ data to bear on discussion and decisions about\n   protocol engineering in an\
    \ Internet full of middleboxes.\n   The HOPS (How Ossified is the Protocol Stack)\
    \ informal birds of a\n   feather session (\"Bar BoF\") was held at the IETF 92\
    \ meeting in\n   Dallas, to discuss approaches to get aggregated data from these\
    \ logs\n   about potential middlebox impairment, focusing on common data formats\n\
    \   and issues of preserving end-user privacy.  While some discussion\n   focused\
    \ on aggregating impairment observations at the network level,\n   initial work\
    \ will focus on making relative prevalence information\n   available on an Internet-wide\
    \ scope.  The first activity identified\n   has been to match the types of data\
    \ required to answer questions\n   relevant to protocol engineering to the data\
    \ that currently is or can\n   easily be collected.\n   A mailing list (hops@ietf.org)\
