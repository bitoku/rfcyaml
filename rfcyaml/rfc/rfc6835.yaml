  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol [RFC6830] specifies an\n\
    \   architecture and mechanism for replacing the addresses currently used\n  \
    \ by IP with two separate namespaces: Endpoint IDs (EIDs), used within\n   sites,\
    \ and Routing Locators (RLOCs), used on the transit networks\n   that make up\
    \ the Internet infrastructure.  To achieve this\n   separation, LISP defines protocol\
    \ mechanisms for mapping from EIDs to\n   RLOCs.  In addition, LISP assumes the\
    \ existence of a database to\n   store and propagate those mappings globally.\
    \  Several such databases\n   have been proposed, among them: a Content distribution\
    \ Overlay\n   Network Service for LISP [LISP-CONS], a Not-so-novel EID-to-RLOC\n\
    \   Database (LISP-NERD) [RFC6837], and LISP Alternative Topology (LISP+\n   ALT)\
    \ [RFC6836], with LISP+ALT being the system that is currently\n   being implemented\
    \ and deployed on the pilot LISP network.\n   In conjunction with the various\
    \ mapping systems, there exists a\n   network-based API called LISP Map-Server\
    \ [RFC6833].  Using Map-\n   Resolvers and Map-Servers allows LISP sites to query\
    \ and register\n   into the database in a uniform way independent of the mapping\
    \ system\n   used.  Sending Map-Requests to Map-Resolvers provides a secure\n\
    \   mechanism to obtain a Map-Reply containing the authoritative EID-to-\n   RLOC\
    \ mapping for a destination LISP site.\n   The 'lig' is a manual management tool\
    \ to query the mapping database.\n   It can be run by all devices that implement\
    \ LISP, including Ingress\n   Tunnel Routers (ITRs), Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs),\
    \ Proxy-ITRs,\n   Proxy-ETRs, Map-Resolvers, Map-Servers, and LISP-ALT Routers,\
    \ as well\n   as by a host system at either a LISP-capable or non-LISP-capable\n\
    \   site.\n   The mapping database system is typically a public database used\
    \ for\n   wide-range connectivity across Internet sites.  The information in\n\
    \   the public database is purposely not kept private so it can be\n   generally\
    \ accessible for public use.\n"
- title: 2.  Definition of Terms
  contents:
  - "2.  Definition of Terms\n   Map-Server:   a network infrastructure component\
    \ that learns EID-to-\n      RLOC mapping entries from an authoritative source\
    \ (typically, an\n      ETR, though static configuration or another out-of-band\
    \ mechanism\n      may be used).  A Map-Server advertises these mappings in the\n\
    \      distributed mapping database.\n   Map-Resolver:   a network infrastructure\
    \ component that accepts LISP\n      Encapsulated Map-Requests, typically from\
    \ an ITR, quickly\n      determines whether or not the destination IP address\
    \ is part of\n      the EID namespace; if it is not, a Negative Map-Reply is\n\
    \      immediately returned.  Otherwise, the Map-Resolver finds the\n      appropriate\
    \ EID-to-RLOC mapping by consulting the distributed\n      mapping database system.\n\
    \   Routing Locator (RLOC):   the IPv4 or IPv6 address of an Egress\n      Tunnel\
    \ Router (ETR).  It is the output of an EID-to-RLOC mapping\n      lookup.  An\
    \ EID maps to one or more RLOCs.  Typically, RLOCs are\n      numbered from topologically\
    \ aggregatable blocks that are assigned\n      to a site at each point to which\
    \ it attaches to the global\n      Internet.  Thus, the topology is defined by\
    \ the connectivity of\n      provider networks, and RLOCs can be thought of as\
    \ Provider-\n      Assigned (PA) addresses.  Multiple RLOCs can be assigned to\
    \ the\n      same ETR device or to multiple ETR devices at a site.\n   Endpoint\
    \ ID (EID):   a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for IPv6) value\n      used in the\
    \ source and destination address fields of the first\n      (most inner) LISP\
    \ header of a packet.  The host obtains a\n      destination EID the same way\
    \ it obtains a destination address\n      today, for example, through a DNS lookup.\
    \  The source EID is\n      obtained via existing mechanisms used to set a host's\
    \ \"local\" IP\n      address.  An EID is allocated to a host from an EID-prefix\
    \ block\n      associated with the site where the host is located.  An EID can\
    \ be\n      used by a host to refer to other hosts.  EIDs must not be used as\n\
    \      LISP RLOCs.  Note that EID blocks may be assigned in a\n      hierarchical\
    \ manner, independent of the network topology, to\n      facilitate scaling of\
    \ the mapping database.  In addition, an EID\n      block assigned to a site may\
    \ have site-local structure\n      (subnetting) for routing within the site; this\
    \ structure is not\n      visible to the global routing system.\n   EID-to-RLOC\
    \ Cache:   a short-lived, on-demand table in an ITR that\n      stores, tracks,\
    \ and is responsible for timing-out and otherwise\n      validating EID-to-RLOC\
    \ mappings.  This cache is distinct from the\n      full \"database\" of EID-to-RLOC\
    \ mappings; the cache is dynamic,\n      local to the ITR(s), and relatively small,\
    \ while the database is\n      distributed, relatively static, and much more global\
    \ in scope.\n   EID-to-RLOC Database:   a global distributed database that contains\n\
    \      all known EID-prefix to RLOC mappings.  Each potential ETR\n      typically\
    \ contains a small piece of the database: the EID-to-RLOC\n      mappings for\
    \ the EID prefixes \"behind\" the router.  These map to\n      one of the router's\
    \ own, globally-visible, IP addresses.\n   Encapsulated Map-Request (EMR):   an\
    \ EMR is a Map-Request message\n      that is encapsulated with another LISP header\
    \ using UDP\n      destination port number 4342.  It is used so an ITR, PITR,\
    \ or a\n      system initiating a 'lig' command can get the Map-Request to a\n\
    \      Map-Resolver by using locator addresses.  When the Map-Request is\n   \
    \   decapsulated by the Map-Resolver, it will be forwarded on the ALT\n      network\
    \ to the Map-Server that has injected the EID-prefix for a\n      registered site.\
    \  The Map-Server will then encapsulate the Map-\n      Request in a LISP packet\
    \ and send it to an ETR at the site.  The\n      ETR will then return an authoritative\
    \ reply to the system that\n      initiated the request.  See [RFC6830] for packet\
    \ format details.\n   Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR):   An ITR is a router that accepts\
    \ an IP\n      packet with a single IP header (more precisely, an IP packet that\n\
    \      does not contain a LISP header).  The router treats this \"inner\"\n  \
    \    IP destination address as an EID and performs an EID-to-RLOC\n      mapping\
    \ lookup.  The router then prepends an \"outer\" IP header\n      with one of\
    \ its globally routable RLOCs in the source address\n      field and the result\
    \ of the mapping lookup in the destination\n      address field.  Note that this\
    \ destination RLOC may be an\n      intermediate, proxy device that has better\
    \ knowledge of the EID-\n      to-RLOC mapping closer to the destination EID.\
    \  In general, an ITR\n      receives IP packets from site end-systems on one\
    \ side and sends\n      LISP-encapsulated IP packets toward the Internet on the\
    \ other\n      side.\n   Egress Tunnel Router (ETR):   An ETR is a router that\
    \ accepts an IP\n      packet where the destination address in the \"outer\" IP\
    \ header is\n      one of its own RLOCs.  The router strips the \"outer\" header\
    \ and\n      forwards the packet based on the next IP header found.  In\n    \
    \  general, an ETR receives LISP-encapsulated IP packets from the\n      Internet\
    \ on one side and sends decapsulated IP packets to site\n      end-systems on\
    \ the other side.  ETR functionality does not have to\n      be limited to a router\
    \ device.  A server host can be the endpoint\n      of a LISP tunnel as well.\n\
    \   Proxy-ITR (PITR):   A PITR, also known as a PTR, is defined and\n      described\
    \ in [RFC6832].  A PITR acts like an ITR but does so on\n      behalf of non-LISP\
    \ sites that send packets to destinations at LISP\n      sites.\n   Proxy-ETR\
    \ (PETR):   A PETR is defined and described in [RFC6832].  A\n      PETR acts\
    \ like an ETR but does so on behalf of LISP sites that\n      send packets to\
    \ destinations at non-LISP sites.\n   xTR:   An xTR is a reference to an ITR or\
    \ ETR when direction of data\n      flow is not part of the context description.\
    \ xTR refers to the\n      router that is the tunnel endpoint; it is used synonymously\
    \ with\n      the term \"tunnel router\".  For example, \"an xTR can be located\
    \ at\n      the Customer Edge (CE) router\" means that both ITR and ETR\n    \
    \  functionality is at the CE router.\n   Provider-Assigned (PA) Addresses:  \
    \ PA addresses are an address block\n      assigned to a site by each service\
    \ provider to which a site\n      connects.  Typically, each block is a sub-block\
    \ of a service-\n      provider Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) [RFC4632]\
    \ block and\n      is aggregated into the larger block before being advertised\
    \ into\n      the global Internet.  Traditionally, IP multihoming has been\n \
    \     implemented by each multihomed site acquiring its own globally\n      visible\
    \ prefix.  LISP uses only topologically assigned and\n      aggregatable address\
    \ blocks for RLOCs, eliminating this\n      demonstrably non-scalable practice.\n"

  - "3.  Basic Overview\n   When the 'lig' command is run, a Map-Request is sent for\
    \ a\n   destination EID.  When a Map-Reply is returned, the contents are\n   displayed\
    \ to the user.  The information displayed includes:\n   o  The EID-prefix for\
    \ the site that the queried destination EID\n      matches.\n   o  The locator\
    \ address of the Map Replier.\n   o  The Locator-Set for the mapping entry, which\
    \ includes the locator\n      address, up/down status, priority, and weight of\
    \ each Locator.\n   o  A round-trip-time estimate for the Map-Request/Map-Reply\
    \ exchange.\n   A possible syntax for a 'lig' command could be:\n       lig <destination>\
    \ [source <source>] [to <map-resolver>]\n   Parameter description:\n   <destination>:\
    \  is either a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or a\n      destination EID\
    \ for a remote LISP site.\n   source <source>:  is an optional source EID to be\
    \ inserted in the\n      'Source EID' field of the Map-Request.\n   to <map-resolver>:\
    \  is an optional FQDN or RLOC address for a Map-\n      Resolver.\n   The 'lig'\
    \ utility has two use cases.  The first is a way to query the\n   mapping database\
    \ for a particular EID.  The other is to verify if a\n   site has registered successfully\
    \ with a Map-Server.\n   The first usage has already been described.  Verifying\
    \ registration\n   is called \"ligging yourself\"; it happens as follows.  In\
    \ the 'lig'\n   initiator, a Map-Request is sent for one of the EIDs for the 'lig'\n\
    \   initiator's site.  The Map-Request is then returned to one of the\n   ETRs\
    \ for the 'lig'-initiating site.  In response to the Map-Request,\n   a Map-Reply\
    \ is sent back to the locator address of the 'lig'\n   initiator (note the Map-Reply\
    \ could be sent by the 'lig' initiator).\n   That Map-Reply is processed, and\
    \ the mapping data for the 'lig'-\n   initiating site is displayed for the user.\
    \  Refer to the syntax in\n   Section 4.1 for an implementation of \"ligging yourself\"\
    .  However,\n   for host-based implementations within a LISP site, \"lig self\"\
    \ is less\n   useful since the host may not have an RLOC with which to receive\
    \ a\n   Map-Reply.  But, 'lig' can be used in a non-LISP site, as well as\n  \
    \ from infrastructure hosts, to get mapping information.\n"

- title: 4.1.  LISP Router Implementation
  contents:
  - "4.1.  LISP Router Implementation\n   The Cisco LISP prototype implementation\
    \ has support for 'lig' for\n   IPv4 and IPv6.  The command line description is:\n\
    \       lig <dest-eid> [source <source-eid>] [to <mr>] [count <1-5>]\n   This\
    \ command initiates the LISP Internet Groper.  It is similar to\n   the DNS analogue\
    \ 'dig' but works on the LISP mapping database.  When\n   this command is invoked,\
    \ the local system will send a Map-Request to\n   the configured Map-Resolver.\
    \  When a Map-Reply is returned, its\n   contents will be displayed to the user.\
    \  By default, up to three Map-\n   Requests are sent if no Map-Reply is returned,\
    \ but, once a Map-Reply\n   is returned, no other Map-Requests are sent.  The\
    \ destination can\n   take a DNS name, or an IPv4 or IPv6 EID address.  The <source-eid>\n\
    \   can be one of the EID addresses assigned to the site in the default\n   Virtual\
    \ Routing and Forwarding (VRF) table.  When <mr> is specified,\n   then the Map-Request\
    \ is sent to the address.  Otherwise, the Map-\n   Request is sent to a configured\
    \ Map-Resolver.  When a Map-Resolver is\n   not configured, then the Map-Request\
    \ is sent on the ALT network if\n   the local router is attached to the ALT. \
    \ When \"count <1-5>\" is\n   specified, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 Map-Requests are sent.\n\
    \   Some sample output:\n     router# lig abc.example.com\n     Send map-request\
    \ to 10.0.0.1 for 192.168.1.1 ...\n     Received map-reply from 10.0.0.2 with\
    \ rtt 0.081468 secs\n     Map-Cache entry for abc.example.com EID 192.168.1.1:\n\
    \     192.168.1.0/24, uptime: 13:59:59, expires: 23:59:58,\n                 \

    \   Using 'lig' to \"lig yourself\" is accomplished with the following\n   syntax:\n\
    \       lig {self | self6} [source <source-eid>] [to <mr>] [count <1-5>]\n   Use\
    \ this command for a simple way to see if the site is registered\n   with the\
    \ mapping database system.  The destination-EID address for\n   the Map-Request\
    \ will be the first configured EID-prefix for the site\n   (with the host bits\
    \ set to 0).  For example, if the site's EID-prefix\n   is 192.168.1.0/24, the\
    \ destination-EID for the Map-Request is\n   192.168.1.0.  The source-EID address\
    \ for the Map-Request will also be\n   192.168.1.0 (in this example), and the\
    \ Map-Request is sent to the\n   configured Map-Resolver.  If the Map-Resolver\
    \ and Map-Server are the\n   same LISP system, then the \"lig self\" is testing\
    \ if the Map-Resolver\n   can \"turn back a Map-Request to the site\".  If another\
    \ Map-Resolver\n   is used, it can test that the site's EID-prefix has been injected\n\
    \   into the ALT infrastructure, in which case the 'lig' Map-Request is\n   processed\
    \ by the Map-Resolver and propagated through each ALT-Router\n   hop to the site's\
    \ registered Map-Server.  Then, the Map-Server\n   returns the Map-Request to\
    \ the originating site.  In that case, an\n   xTR at the originating site sends\
    \ a Map-Reply to the source of the\n   Map-Request (could be itself or another\
    \ xTR for the site).  All other\n   command parameters are described above.  Using\
    \ \"lig self6\" tests for\n   registering of IPv6 EID-prefixes.\n   Some sample\

- title: 5.  Testing the ALT
  contents:
  - "5.  Testing the ALT\n   There are cases where a Map-Reply is returned from a\
    \ 'lig' request,\n   but the user doesn't really know how much of the mapping\n\
    \   infrastructure was tested.  There are two cases to consider --\n   avoiding\
    \ the ALT and traversing the ALT.\n   When an ITR sends a 'lig' request to its\
    \ Map-Resolver for a\n   destination-EID, the Map-Resolver could also be configured\
    \ as a Map-\n   Server.  And if the destination-EID is for a site that registers\
    \ with\n   this Map-Server, the Map-Request is sent to the site directly without\n\
    \   testing the ALT.  This occurs because the Map-Server is the source of\n  \
    \ the advertisement for the site's EID-prefix.  So, if the map-reply is\n   returned\
    \ to the 'lig'-requesting site, you cannot be sure that other\n   sites can reach\
    \ the same destination-EID.\n   If a Map-Resolver is used that is not a Map-Server\
    \ for the EID-prefix\n   being sought, then the ALT infrastructure can be tested.\
    \  This test\n   case is testing the functionality of the Map-Resolver, traversal\
    \ of\n   the ALT (testing BGP-over-GRE), and the Map-Server.\n   It is recommended\
    \ that users issue two 'lig' requests; they send Map-\n   Requests to different\
    \ Map-Resolvers.\n   The network can have a LISP-ALT Router deployed as a \"ALT\
    \ looking-\n   glass\" node.  This type of router has BGP peering sessions with\
    \ other\n   ALT Routers where it does not inject any EID-prefixes into the ALT\n\
    \   but just learns ones advertised by other ALT Routers and Map-Servers.\n  \
    \ This router is configured as a Map-Resolver. 'lig' users can point to\n   the\
    \ ALT looking-glass router for Map-Resolver services via the \"to\n   <map-resolver>\"\
    \ parameter on the 'lig' command.  The ALT looking-\n   glass node can be used\
    \ to 'lig' other sites as well as your own site.\n   When the ALT looking-glass\
    \ is used as a Map-Resolver, you can be\n   assured the ALT network is being tested.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Future Enhancements\n   When Negative Map-Replies have been further developed\
    \ and\n   implemented, 'lig' should be modified appropriately to process and\n\
    \   clearly indicate how and why a Negative Map-Reply was received.\n   Negative\
    \ Map-Replies could be sent in the following cases: the 'lig'\n   request was\
    \ initiated for a non-EID address or there was rate-\n   limiting on the replier.\n"

  - "7.  Deployed Network Diagnostic Tools\n   There is a web-based interface to do\
    \ auto-polling with 'lig' on the\n   back-end for most of the LISP sites on the\
    \ LISP test network.  The\n   web page can be accessed at <http://www.lisp4.net/status>.\n\
    \   There is a LISP site monitoring web-based interface that can be found\n  \
    \ at <http://lispmon.net>.\n   At <http://baldomar.ccaba.upc.edu/lispmon>, written\
    \ by the folks at\n   Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC), shows a geographical\
    \ map\n   indicating where each LISP site resides.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The use of 'lig' does not affect the security\
    \ of the LISP\n   infrastructure as it is simply a tool that facilities diagnostic\n\
    \   querying.  See [RFC6830], [RFC6836], and [RFC6833] for descriptions\n   of\
    \ the security properties of the LISP infrastructure.\n   'lig' provides easy\
    \ access to the information in the public mapping\n   database.  Therefore, it\
    \ is important to protect the mapping\n   information for private use.  This can\
    \ be provided by disallowing\n   access to specific mapping entries or to place\
    \ such entries in a\n   private mapping database system.\n"
