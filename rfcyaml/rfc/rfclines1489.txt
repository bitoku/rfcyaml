Though the proposed character set "koi8 r" is not currently an international standard, there is very large user community (including Relcom Net) supporting it.
Factually, "koi8 r" is de facto standard for Unix and global network applications in the former Soviet Union.
This is the reason the Society of Unix User Groups (SUUG) believes "koi8 r" should be registered.
koi8 r Published specification: This standard is unpublished, but based on several published standards: GOST 19768 74 (old koi8), ISO 6937/8 (not registered) and variations: INIS cyrillic, ISO 5427.
