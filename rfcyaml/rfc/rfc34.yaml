  - "SOME BRIEF PRELIMINARY NOTES ON THE ARC CLOCK\nThe ARC clock system provides\
    \ a time reference that is written into the\ncore memory of the XDS 940 Computer.\
    \ There are two types of time\ninformation available--absolute and relative.\n\
    The absolute time is written into two adjacent words of core with the\nfollowing\
    \ format:\n   First word --\n      Bits 0 thru 7 contain the month code in straight\
    \ binary with a\n      range of 1 to 12\n      Bits 8 thru 15 contain the day\
    \ code in straight binary with a\n      range of 1 to 31\n      Bits 16 thru 23\
    \ contain the year code in straight binary with\n      range of 0 to 99\n   Second\
    \ word --\n      Bits 00 thru 7 contain the hour code written in straight binary\n\
    \      with a range of 0 to 23\n      Bits 8 thru 15 contain the minute code written\
    \ in straight binary\n      with a range of 0 to 60\n      Bits 16 thru 23 contain\
    \ the second code written in straight binary\n      with range ofr 0 to 60\nThese\
    \ 2 words are written once each second.  It is anticipated that the\naccuracy\
    \ of the initial setting will be on the order of 1 second, as\nreferred to WWV,\
    \ and that the oscillator drift rate will not account for\nan accumlated error\
    \ of more than 1 second every 250 days.  The\noscillator and clock are provided\
    \ with standby power in order to\nmaintain the accuracy of the system.  Because\
    \ of variable delays in time\nrequired to obtain access to the 940 core memory,\
    \ it is anticipated that\nthe short-term accuracy will be on the order of 10 to\
    \ 20 microseconds.\nThe relative time, which is written into one word of core\
    \ memory, is\nsimply the contents of a 24 bit binary accumulator.  The rate at\
    \ which\nthe accumulator is updated can be chosen to be either once very 100\n\
    micro seconds or once every millisecond.  In either case the core\nlocation is\
    \ written each time the accumulator is updated.  As above the\nshort-term accuracy\
    \ will be about 10 to 20 microseconds and the long-\nterm accuracy will be the\
    \ equivalent of one second every 250 days.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Katsunori\
    \ Tanaka 1/98 ]\n"
