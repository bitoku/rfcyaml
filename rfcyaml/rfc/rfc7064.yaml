  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the
    Uniform\n   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Traversal Utilities\n
    \  for NAT (STUN) protocol.\n   STUN is a protocol that serves as a tool for other
    protocols in\n   dealing with Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.  It
    can be\n   used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated
    to\n   it by a NAT, to perform connectivity checks between two endpoints,\n   and
    as a keepalive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.  RFC 5389\n   [RFC5389] defines
    the specifics of the STUN protocol.\n   The \"stun\" and \"stuns\" URI schemes
    are used to designate a stand-\n   alone STUN server or any Internet host performing
    the operations of a\n   STUN server in the context of STUN usages (Section 14
    of RFC 5389\n   [RFC5389]).  With the advent of standards such as WebRTC [WEBRTC],
    we\n   anticipate a plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able to\n
    \  identify and communicate with such a STUN server to carry out the\n   STUN
    protocol.  This implies that endpoints and/or applications must\n   be provisioned
    with the appropriate configuration to identify the\n   STUN server. Having an
    inconsistent syntax adds ambiguity and can\n   result in non-interoperable solutions
    and implementation limitations.\n   The \"stun\" and \"stuns\" URI schemes help
    alleviate most of these\n   issues by providing a consistent way to describe,
    configure, and\n   exchange the information identifying a STUN server.\n"

    and \"OPTIONAL\"\n   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]
    when\n   they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in ALL CAPS (such\n
    \  as \"should\" or \"Should\"), they have their usual English meanings and\n
    \  are not to be interpreted as RFC 2119 key words.\n"

    - "3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax\n   \"stun\" and \"stuns\" URIs have the following
      formal ABNF syntax\n   [RFC5234]:\n   stunURI       = scheme \":\" host [ \":\"
      port ]\n   scheme        = \"stun\" / \"stuns\"\n   <host> and <port> are specified
      in [RFC3986].  While these two ABNF\n   productions are defined in [RFC3986]
      as components of the generic\n   hierarchical URI, this does not imply that
      the \"stun\" and \"stuns\" URI\n   schemes are hierarchical URIs.  Developers
      MUST NOT use a generic\n   hierarchical URI parser to parse a \"stun\" or \"stuns\"
      URI.\n"
    title: 3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  URI Scheme Semantics\n   The \"stun\" and \"stuns\" URI schemes are used
      to designate a stand-\n   alone STUN server or any Internet host performing
      the operations of a\n   STUN server in the context of STUN usages (Section 14
      of RFC 5389\n   [RFC5389]).  The STUN protocol supports sending messages over
      UDP,\n   TCP, or TLS-over-TCP.  The \"stuns\" URI scheme MUST be used when STUN\n
      \  is run over TLS-over-TCP (or in the future DTLS-over-UDP), and the\n   \"stun\"
      scheme MUST be used otherwise.\n   The required <host> part of the \"stun\"
      URI denotes the STUN server\n   host.\n   For the optional DNS discovery procedure
      mentioned in Section 9 of\n   RFC 5389, the \"stun\" URI scheme implies UDP
      as the transport protocol\n   for SRV lookup, and the \"stuns\" URI scheme indicates
      TCP as the\n   transport protocol.\n   As specified in [RFC5389], the <port>
      part, if present, denotes the\n   port on which the STUN server is awaiting
      connection requests.  If it\n   is absent, the default port is 3478 for both
      UDP and TCP.  The\n   default port for STUN over TLS is 5349 as per Section
      9 of [RFC5389].\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The \"stun\" and \"stuns\" URI schemes do not
    introduce any specific\n   security issues beyond the security considerations
    discussed in\n   [RFC3986].  These URI schemes are intended for use in specific\n
    \  environments that involve NAT traversal.  Users of the scheme need to\n   carefully
    consider the security properties of the context in which\n   they are using them.\n
    \  Although a \"stun\" or \"stuns\" URI does not itself include the username\n
    \  or password that will be used to authenticate the STUN client, in\n   certain
    environments, such as WebRTC, the username and password will\n   almost certainly
    be provisioned remotely by an external agent at the\n   same time as a \"stuns\"
    URI is sent to that client.  Thus, in such\n   situations, if the username and
    password were received in the clear,\n   there would be little or no benefit to
    using a \"stuns\" URI.  For this\n   reason, a STUN client MUST ensure that the
    username, password,\n   \"stuns\" URI, and any other security-relevant parameters
    are received\n   with equivalent security before using the \"stuns\" URI.  Receiving\n
    \  those parameters over another TLS session can provide the appropriate\n   level
    of security if both TLS sessions are similarly parameterized,\n   e.g., with commensurate
    strength ciphersuites.\n"

    suffix \"s\" on the URI\n      scheme and to move the secure option to a parameter
    (e.g.,\n      \";proto=tls\").  We decided against this idea because the need
    for\n      \";proto=\" for the STUN URI cannot be sufficiently explained, and\n
    \     supporting it would render an incomplete specification.  This\n      would
    also result in lost symmetry between the TURN and STUN URIs.\n   o  Following
    the advice of Section 2.2 of [RFC4395], and because the\n      STUN URI does not
    describe a hierarchical structure, the STUN URIs\n      are opaque.\n"
