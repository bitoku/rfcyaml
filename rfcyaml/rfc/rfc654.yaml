  - "2. Command meanings\n   In the following, we are discussing a simplex connection,\
    \ as described in \n   the NAOL and NAOP Telnet options.\n      IAC DO NAOHTD\n\
    \         The data sender requests or agrees to negotiate about output \n    \
    \     horizontal tab character disposition with the data receiver.  In the \n\
    \         case where agreement has been reached and in the absence of further\
    \ \n         subnegotiations, the data receiver is assumed to be handling output\
    \ \n         horizontal tab character considerations.\n      IAC DON'T NAOHTD\n\
    \         The data sender refuses to negotiate about output horizontal tab \n\
    \         characters with the data receiver, or demands a return to the \n   \
    \      unnegotiated default mode.\n      IAC WILL NAOHTD\n         The data receiver\
    \ requests or agrees to negotiate about output\n         horizontal tab characters\
    \ with the sender. In the case where\n         agreement has been reached and\
    \ in the absence of further\n         subnegotiations, the data receiver alone\
    \ is assumed to be handling\n         output horizontal tab character considerations.\n\
    \      IAC WON'T NAOHTD\n         The data receiver refuses to negotiate about\
    \ output horizontal tab \n         characters, or demands a return to the unnegotiated\
    \ default mode. \n      IAC SB NAOHTD DS <8-bit value> IAC SE\n         The data\
    \ sender specifies, with the 8-bit value, which party should\n         handle\
    \ output horizontal tab characters and what their disposition\n         should\
    \ be.  The code for DS is 1.\n      IAC SB NAOHTD DR <8-bit value> IAC SE\n  \
    \       The data receiver specifies, with the 8-bit value, which party\n     \
    \    should handle output horizontal tab characters and what their\n         disposition\
    \ should be.  The code for DR is 0.\n"

  - "3. Default\n   DON'T NAOHTD/WON'T NAOHTD.\n      In the default absence of negotiations\
    \ concerning which party, data\n      sender or data receiver, is handling output\
    \ horizontal tab character\n      considerations, neither party is required to\
    \ handle horizontal tab\n      characters and neither party is prohibited from\
    \ handling them; but it\n      is appropriate if at least the data receiver handles\
    \ horizontal tab\n      character considerations, albeit primitively.\n   DS and\
    \ DR SB commands as follows:\n      8-bit value                      Meaning \
    \                      \n      0            Command sender suggests that he alone\
    \ will handle  \n                   horizontal tab characters, for the connection.\
    \     \n      1 to 250     Command sender suggests that the other party alone\
    \ \n                   should handle horizontal tab characters, but       \n \
    \                  suggests that a delay of the indicated value be    \n     \
    \              used. The value is the number of character-times   \n         \
    \          to wait or number of NULs to insert in the data    \n             \
    \      stream before sending the next data character. \n      251          Command\
    \ sender suggests that the other party alone \n                   handle horizontal\
    \ tabs, but suggests that each     \n                   occurrence of the character\
    \ be replaced by a space. \n      252          Command sender suggests that the\
    \ other party alone \n                   handle horizontal tabs, but suggests\
    \ that they be  \n                   discarded.                              \
    \           \n      253          Command sender suggests that the other party\
    \ alone \n                   should handle horizontal tab characters, but    \
    \   \n                   suggests that tabbing be simulated.                \n\
    \      254          Command sender suggests that the other party alone \n    \
    \               should handle horizontal tab characters, but       \n        \
    \           suggests that waiting for a character to be        \n            \
    \       transmitted (on the other simplex connection)      \n                \
    \   before sending more data. Note that, due to the    \n                   assynchrony\
    \ of the two simplex connections, phase  \n                   problems can occur\
    \ with this option.               \n      255          Command sender suggests\
    \ that the other party alone \n                   should handle output horizontal\
    \ tabs and suggests  \n                   nothing about how it should be done.\n\
    \   The guiding rules are that: \n      1) if neither data receiver nor data sender\
    \ wants to handle output \n      horizontal tab characters, the data receiver\
    \ must do it, and\n      2) if both data receiver and data sender wants to handle\
    \ output \n      horizontal tab characters, the data sender gets to do it. \n\
    \   The reasoning for the former rule is that if neither wants to do it, then\n\
    \   the default in the NAOHTD option dominates.  If both want to do it, the\n\
    \   sender, who is presumed to have special knowledge about the data, should\n\
    \   be allowed to do it, taking into account any suggestions the receiver may\n\
    \   make.  Simulation is defined as the replacement of the horizontal tab\n  \
    \ character by enough spaces to move the printer head (or line-pointer) to\n \
    \  the next horizontal tab stop.\n   Note that delays, controlled by the data\
    \ sender, must consist of NUL\n   characters inserted immediately after the horizontal\
    \ tab character.  This\n   is necessary due to the assynchrony of network transmissions.\
    \  As with\n   all option negotiations, neither party should suggest a state already\
    \ in\n   effect except to refuse to negotiate; changes should be acknowledged;\
    \ and\n   once refused, an option should not be resuggested until \"something\n"
