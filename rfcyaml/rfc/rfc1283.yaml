  - "1.  Background\n   The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as defined in\
    \ [1] is\n   now used as an integral part of the network management framework\
    \ for\n   TCP/IP-based internets.  Together, with its companions standards,\n\
    \   which define the Structure of Management Information (SMI) [2], and\n   the\
    \ Management Information Base (MIB) [3], the SNMP has received\n   widespread\
    \ deployment in many operational networks running the\n   Internet suite of protocols.\n\
    \   It should not be surprising that many of these sites might acquire\n   OSI\
    \ capabilities and may wish to leverage their investment in SNMP\n   technology\
    \ towards managing those OSI components.  This memo\n   addresses these concerns\
    \ by defining a framework for running the SNMP\n   in an environment which supports\
    \ the OSI transport services.\n   In OSI, there are two such services, a connection-oriented\
    \ transport\n   services (COTS) as defined in [4], and a connectionless-mode\n\
    \   transport service (CLTS) as defined in [5].  Although the primary\n   deployment\
    \ of the SNMP is over the connectionless-mode transport\n   service provided by\
    \ the Internet suite of protocols (i.e., the User\n   Datagram Protocol or UDP\
    \ [6]), a design goal of the SNMP was to be\n   able to use either a CO-mode or\
    \ CL-mode transport service.  As such,\n   this memo describes mappings from the\
    \ SNMP onto both the COTS and the\n   CLTS.\n"
- title: 1.1.  A Digression on User Interfaces
  contents:
  - "1.1.  A Digression on User Interfaces\n   It is likely that user-interfaces to\
    \ the SNMP will be developed that\n   support multiple transport backings.  In\
    \ an environment such as this,\n   it is often important to maintain a consistent\
    \ addressing scheme for\n   users.  Since the mappings described in this memo\
    \ are onto the OSI\n   transport services, use of the textual scheme described\
    \ in [7], which\n   describes a string encoding for OSI presentation addresses,\
    \ is\n   recommended.  The syntax defined in [7] is equally applicable towards\n\
    \   transport addresses.\n   In this context, a string encoding usually appears\
    \ as:\n      [<t-selector>/]<n-provider><n-address>[+<n-info>]\n      where:\n\
    \      (1)  <t-selector> is usually either an ASCII string enclosed\n        \
    \   in double-quotes (e.g., \"snmp\"), or a hexadecimal number\n           (e.g.,\
    \ '736e6d70'H);\n      (2)  <n-provider> is one of several well-known providers\
    \ of a\n           connectivity-service, one of: \"Internet=\" for a\n       \
    \    transport-service from the Internet suite of protocols,\n           \"Int-X25=\"\
    \ for the 1980 CCITT X.25 recommendation, or\n           \"NS+\" for the OSI network\
    \ service;\n      (3)  <n-address> is an address in a format specific to the\n\
    \           <n-provider>; and,\n      (4)  <n-info> is any additional addressing\
    \ information in a\n           format specific to the <n-provider>.\n   It is\
    \ not the purpose of this memo to provide an exhaustive\n   description of string\
    \ encodings such as these.  Readers should\n   consult [7] for detailed information\
    \ on the syntax.  However, this\n   memo recommends that, as an implementation\
    \ option, user-interfaces to\n   the SNMP that support multiple transport backings\
    \ SHOULD implement\n   this syntax.\n"
- title: 1.1.1.  Addressing Conventions for UDP-based service
  contents:
  - "1.1.1.  Addressing Conventions for UDP-based service\n   In the context of a\
    \ UDP-based transport backing, addresses would be\n   encoded as:\n          \
    \                 Internet=<host>+161+2\n   which says that the transport service\
    \ is from the Internet suite of\n   protocols, residing at <host>, on port 161,\
    \ using the UDP (2).  The\n   token <host> may be either a domain name or a dotted-quad,\
    \ e.g., both\n                     Internet=cheetah.nyser.net+161+2\n   and\n\
    \                        Internet=192.52.180.1+161+2\n   are both valid.  Note\
    \ however that if domain name \"cheetah.nyser.net\"\n   maps to multiple IP addresses,\
    \ then this implies multiple transport\n   addresses.  The number of addresses\
    \ examined by the application (and\n   the order of examination) are specific\
    \ to each application.\n   Of course, this memo does not require that other interface\
    \ schemes\n   not be used.  Clearly, use of a simple hostname is preferable to\
    \ the\n   string encoding above.  However, for the sake of uniformity, for\n \
    \  those user-interfaces to the SNMP that support multiple transport\n   backings,\
    \ it is strongly RECOMMENDED that the syntax in [7] be\n   adopted and even the\
    \ mapping for UDP-based transport be valid.\n"
- title: 1.2.  A Digression of Layering
  contents:
  - "1.2.  A Digression of Layering\n   Although other frameworks view network management\
    \ as an application,\n   extensive experience with the SNMP suggests otherwise.\
    \  In essense,\n   network management is a function unlike any other user of a\
    \ transport\n   service.  The citation [8] develops this argument in full.  As\
    \ such,\n   it is inappropriate to map the SNMP onto the OSI application layer.\n\
    \   Rather, it is mapped to OSI transport services, in order to build on\n   the\
    \ proven success of the Internet network management framework.\n"
- title: 2.  Mapping onto CLTS
  contents:
  - "2.  Mapping onto CLTS\n   Mapping the SNMP onto the CLTS is straight-forward.\
    \  The elements of\n   procedure are identical to that of using the UDP, with\
    \ one exception:\n   a slightly different Trap PDU is used.  Further, note that\
    \ the CLTS\n   and the service offered by the UDP both transmit packets of\n \
    \  information which contain full addressing information.  Thus, mapping\n   the\
    \ SNMP onto the CLTS, a \"transport address\" in the context of [1],\n   is simply\
    \ a transport-selector and network address.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Addressing Conventions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Addressing Conventions\n   Unlike the Internet suite of protocols, OSI\
    \ does not use well-known\n   ports.  Rather demultiplexing occurs on the basis\
    \ of \"selectors\",\n   which are opaque strings of octets, which have meaning\
    \ only at the\n   destination.  In order to foster interoperable implementations\
    \ of the\n   SNMP over the CLTS, it is necessary define a selector for this\n\
    \   purpose.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Conventions for CLNP-based service
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Conventions for CLNP-based service\n   When the CLTS is used to provide\
    \ the transport backing for the SNMP,\n   demultiplexing will occur on the basis\
    \ of transport selector.  The\n   transport selector used shall be the four ASCII\
    \ characters\n                                   snmp\n   Thus, using the string\
    \ encoding of [7], such addresses may be\n   textual, described as:\n        \
    \                     \"snmp\"/NS+<nsap>\n   where:\n   (1)  <nsap> is a hex string\
    \ defining the nsap, e.g.,\n                     \"snmp\"/NS+4900590800200038bafe00\n\
    \   Similarly, SNMP traps are, by convention, sent to a manager listening\n  \
    \ on the transport selector\n                                 snmp-trap\n   which\
    \ consists of nine ASCII characters.\n"
- title: 3.  Mapping onto COTS
  contents:
  - "3.  Mapping onto COTS\n   Mapping the SNMP onto the COTS is more difficult as\
    \ the SNMP does not\n   specifically require an existing connection.  Thus, the\
    \ mapping\n   consists of establishing a transport connection, sending one or\
    \ more\n   SNMP messages on that connection, and then releasing the transport\n\
    \   connection.  Further, a slightly different Trap PDU is used.\n   Consistent\
    \ with the SNMP model, the initiator of a connection should\n   not require that\
    \ responses to a request be returned on that\n   connection.  However, if a responder\
    \ to a connection sends SNMP\n   messages on a connection, then these MUST be\
    \ in response to requests\n   received on that connection.\n   Ideally, the transport\
    \ connection SHOULD be released by the\n   initiator, however, note that the responder\
    \ may release the\n   connection due to resource limitations.  Further note, that\
    \ the\n   amount of time a connection remains established is implementation-\n\
    \   specific.  Implementors should take care to choose an appropriate\n   dynamic\
    \ algorithm.\n   Also consistent with the SNMP model, the initiator should not\n\
    \   associate any reliability characteristics with the use of a\n   connection.\
    \  Issues such as retransmission of SNMP messages, etc.,\n   always remain with\
    \ the SNMP application, not with the transport\n   service.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Conventions for TP4/CLNP-based service\n   When a COTS based on the TP4/CLNP\
