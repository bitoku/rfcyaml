Abstract RFC 6598 specifies that "Reverse DNS queries for Shared Address Space addresses [100.64.0.0/10]
MUST NOT be forwarded to the global DNS infrastructure.
This document formally directs IANA to add the associated zones to the "IPv4 Locally Served DNS Zones Registry" to prevent such queries from accidentally leaking to the global DNS infrastructure.
Introduction [RFC6598] specifies that "Reverse DNS queries for Shared Address Space addresses [100.64.0.0/10] MUST NOT be forwarded to the global DNS infrastructure."
[RFC6303] provides guidance on handling such queries.
This document directs the IANA to add the IPv4 reverse zones corresponding to 100.64.0.0/10, a netblock reserved in [RFC6598], to the "IPv4 Locally Served DNS Zone Registry" established in [RFC6303].
Unlike the addresses described in [RFC1918], which are not expected to be seen by other parties, the addresses defined by [RFC6598] are expected to be seen by parties other than those deploying the addresses.
Therefore, it is more crucial that recursive nameservers default to serving these zones locally.
Changes to the IPv4 Locally Served DNS Zones Registry
IANA has added the zones listed in "RFC 6598 Zones" (Section 2.1) to the "IPv4 Locally Served DNS Zone Registry".

IANA Considerations Per this document, IANA has added the zones listed in "RFC 6598 Zones" (Section 2.1) to the "IPv4 Locally Served DNS Zone Registry".
IANA is reminded that an insecure delegation for these zones is required for compliance with [RFC6303] to break the DNSSEC chain of trust.
This document does not present additional security risks to the Internet than those described in [RFC6303] and [RFC6598].
