  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a set of enhancements to the Network News\n
    \  Transfer Protocol (NNTP) that allow a client to request extended\n   information
    from NNTP servers regarding server status, policy, and\n   other aspects of local
    configuration.  These enhancements are made as\n   new keywords to the existing
    LIST capability described in RFC 3977.\n   This memo updates and formalizes the
    LIST DISTRIBUTIONS and LIST\n   SUBSCRIPTIONS commands defined in RFC 2980.  It
    also adds the LIST\n   COUNTS, LIST MODERATORS, and LIST MOTD commands, and specifies\n
    \  additional values returned by the existing LIST ACTIVE command for\n   the
    status of a newsgroup.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The NNTP specification [RFC3977] defines the LIST capability
    and a\n   few keywords that can be used with that command: ACTIVE,\n   ACTIVE.TIMES,
    DISTRIB.PATS, HEADERS, NEWSGROUPS, and OVERVIEW.FMT.\n   Other variants of the
    LIST command are in use, but with limited or\n   absent documentation.  These
    variants are formalized in this\n   document.\n   The DISTRIBUTIONS and SUBSCRIPTIONS
    variants were originally\n   documented in [RFC2980].  The LIST DISTRIBUTIONS
    command is sent by a\n   news client to obtain a list of relevant distributions
    known by a\n   news server along with their descriptions.  The LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS\n
    \  command is sent by a news client when first connecting to a news\n   server
    so as to obtain a list of recommended newsgroups available on\n   it.  Both of
    these commands are intended to be used in place of hard-\n   coding news clients
    to use specific distributions or look for\n   specific default newsgroups.\n   The
    MOTD variant was originally documented in [NNTP_LIST] (which also\n   describes
    the SUBSCRIPTIONS variant).  The LIST MOTD command is sent\n   by a news client
    to obtain a \"message of the day\" from the server\n   administrator regarding
    the current state of a news server.\n   The COUNTS and MODERATORS variants have
    not been documented before.\n   The LIST COUNTS command is similar to LIST ACTIVE,
    except that it\n   also returns an estimated number of articles in each newsgroup.
    \ The\n   LIST MODERATORS command is sent by a news client to obtain a list of\n
    \  associations between a moderated newsgroup and its submission address\n   template.\n
    \  The ACTIVE variant was formalized in [RFC3977], but the meanings of\n   only
    three status field values in LIST ACTIVE responses have been\n   specified: \"y\",
    \"n\", and \"m\".  These statuses are particularly useful\n   for readers, since
    they describe local posting rights.  However,\n   several other statuses are in
    use that are primarily useful for peers\n   as they mainly describe how remote
    articles coming from peers are\n   locally handled by a given news server.  This
    memo defines three\n   other values for the status field in LIST ACTIVE responses:
    \"x\", \"j\",\n   and \"=\" followed by the name of a newsgroup.\n   This specification
    should be read in conjunction with the NNTP base\n   specification [RFC3977].
    \ In the case of a conflict between these two\n   documents, [RFC3977] takes precedence.\n"

    - "1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The notational conventions used
      in this document are the same as\n   those in [RFC3977], and any term not defined
      in this document has the\n   same meaning as it does in that one.\n   The key
      words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\",
      \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document
      are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n   When a hexadecimal correspondence
      is given to an octet in this\n   document, the value is in US-ASCII [ASCII]
      (for instance, \".\", noted\n   %x2E).\n   In the examples, commands from the
      client are indicated with [C], and\n   responses from the server are indicated
      with [S].  The client is the\n   initiator of the NNTP connection; the server
      is the other endpoint.\n"

  - "2.  New LIST Variants\n   The LIST capability is defined in Section 7.6 of [RFC3977].
    \ It\n   allows the server to provide useful information to the client in\n   multi-line
    blocks.\n   This document provides five new keywords to the LIST capability:\n
    \  COUNTS, DISTRIBUTIONS, MODERATORS, MOTD, and SUBSCRIPTIONS.\n   Each keyword
    is OPTIONAL and corresponds to the same-named variant of\n   the LIST command.\n"

    - "2.1.  Advertising the New LIST Variants\n   When a news server implements a
      variant of the LIST command as\n   described in this specification, it advertises
      the corresponding\n   feature in the LIST capability.  Where one of these new
      LIST keywords\n   is advertised, it MUST have the meaning given in this specification.\n
      \  For instance, if a news server implements the SUBSCRIPTIONS variant,\n   it
      will add the SUBSCRIPTIONS keyword to the LIST capability in\n   response to
      the CAPABILITIES command (see Section 5.2 of [RFC3977]):\n      [C] CAPABILITIES\n

      \     [S] .\n   For each of the new LIST variants described in this specification,
      an\n   empty response can be sent to the client:\n      [C] LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS\n
      \     [S] 215 List of recommended newsgroups follows\n      [S] .\n   This means
      that the information is maintained by the news server but\n   that it is voluntarily
      empty.  Frequently, the news server maintains\n   the information in a configuration
      file.  This file can be empty or\n   contain only commented or blank lines,
      indicating a voluntary absence\n   of information.\n   When the news server
      software implements one of these LIST variants\n   but a particular server does
      not maintain the information (for\n   instance, when the configuration file
      does not exist), the 503\n   response code MUST be returned:\n      [C] LIST
      SUBSCRIPTIONS\n      [S] 503 No list of recommended newsgroups available\n"

      - "2.2.2.  Description\n   See Section 7.6.1 of [RFC3977] for general requirements
        of the LIST\n   command.\n   The LIST COUNTS command returns a list of valid
        newsgroups carried by\n   the news server along with associated information,
        the \"counts list\",\n   and is similar to LIST ACTIVE.\n   The information
        is returned as a multi-line data block following the\n   215 response code
        and contains one line per newsgroup.  Each line of\n   this list MUST consist
        of five fields separated from each other by\n   one or more spaces (the usual
        practice is a single space) in the\n   following order:\n   o  The name of
        the newsgroup.\n   o  The reported high water mark for the group.\n   o  The
        reported low water mark for the group.\n   o  The estimated number of articles
        in the group.\n   o  The current status of the group on this server.\n   The
        reported high and low water marks, and the estimated number of\n   articles,
        are as described in the GROUP command (see Section 6.1.1 of\n   [RFC3977]),
        but note that they are in the opposite order to the 211\n   response (that
        is, number low high group) to the GROUP command.  The\n   current status of
        the group is as described in the LIST ACTIVE\n   command (see Section 7.6.3
        of [RFC3977], as well as Section 3 of this\n   document).  Also note that,
        similarly to the LIST ACTIVE command, TAB\n   characters are not valid separators
        for the LIST COUNTS command.\n   The order of newsgroups in the counts list
        is not significant.  The\n   server need not consistently return the same
        order or the same\n   results if this command is used more than once in a
        session.\n   The same newsgroup SHOULD NOT appear twice in the output of this\n
        \  command.\n   The counts list is newsgroup-based, and a wildmat MAY be specified,\n
        \  in which case the response is limited to only the groups, if any,\n   whose
        names match the wildmat.  If no wildmat is specified, the\n   server MUST
        include every newsgroup that the client is permitted to\n   select with the
        GROUP command (see Section 6.1.1 of [RFC3977]).\n   The counts list MAY be
        empty.  If the server does not maintain the\n   information, a 503 response
        code MUST be returned.  (However, note\n   that a news server that supports
        this command usually maintains the\n   information.)\n   The client MAY use
        LIST COUNTS in order to obtain an estimate of the\n   number of articles in
        every newsgroup the server carries, which\n   enables it to provide the end
        user with this information.  This\n   provides a simpler mechanism for a client
        to obtain the estimated\n   number of articles in newsgroups, compared with
        a sequence of\n   individual GROUP commands.\n"

    - contents:
      - "2.4.2.  Description\n   See Section 7.6.1 of [RFC3977] for general requirements
        of the LIST\n   command.\n   The \"moderators list\" is maintained by some
        NNTP servers to make\n   clients aware of how the news server will generate
        a submission\n   e-mail address when an article is locally posted to a moderated\n
        \  newsgroup.\n   The information is returned as a multi-line data block following
        the\n   215 response code.  Each line of this list MUST consist of two fields\n
        \  separated from each other by a colon (\":\" or %x3A).  The first field\n
        \  is a wildmat (which may be a simple newsgroup name), and the second\n   field
        is the submission address template for newsgroups matching that\n   wildmat.
        \ There are no leading or trailing whitespaces in a line.\n   The submission
        template MAY contain colons (\":\").\n   The submission template is essentially
        an e-mail address (see the\n   definition of \"addr-spec\" in Section 3.4.1
        of [RFC5322]), except with\n   certain modifications.  The case-sensitive
        string \"%s\" (%x25.73) MUST\n   occur either zero or one time in the template.
        \ If there is to be a\n   literal \"%\" in the submission address, it MUST
        be written as \"%%\" in\n   the template, even if not followed by an \"s\".
        \ The character \"%\" MUST\n   NOT occur in the submission template, except
        as part of \"%s\" or \"%%\".\n   The order of lines in the moderators list
        is significant: the first\n   matching line is used.  Consequently, specific
        patterns should be\n   listed before general patterns.  Every moderated newsgroup
        name\n   SHOULD be matched by at least one line in the list; often this is\n
        \  achieved by having a default pattern at the bottom, but other\n   approaches
        are acceptable, and news server software MAY leave this up\n   to the server
        administrator rather than enforcing it\n   programmatically.\n   When an article
        without an Approved header field is locally posted to\n   a moderated newsgroup,
        the server generates a submission address from\n   the corresponding submission
        template (that is, the second field of\n   the first matching line in the
        moderators list) by replacing the\n   \"%s\", if present, with the name of
        the matching newsgroup after each\n   period (\".\" or %x2E) in the name has
        been changed to a dash (\"-\" or\n   %x2D).  In addition, any \"%%\" is changed
        back to \"%\".  The server\n   then forwards the submitted article to the
        moderator at the resulting\n   submission address (see Section 3.5.1 of [RFC5537]).\n
        \     NOTE: The creation and maintenance of submission addresses is\n      outside
        the scope of this specification.\n   The moderators list is not newsgroup-based,
        and an argument MUST NOT\n   be specified.  Otherwise, a 501 response code
        MUST be returned.\n   The moderators list MAY be empty.  If the server does
        not maintain\n   the information, a 503 response code MUST be returned, although
        these\n   situations should not occur if the news server is an injecting agent\n
        \  that carries moderated newsgroups.\n"

        a \"%s\" pattern template cannot be used for\n      the moderation submission
        addresses for those groups, and explicit\n      entries without a pattern
        will be required.\n      Similarly, it is not recommended to use a \"%s\"
        pattern rule for\n      the moderation submission template for two moderated
        newsgroups\n      whose names differ only by the case of their characters,
        because\n      e-mail systems frequently treat the left-hand side of e-mail\n
        \     addresses as case-sensitive.  See also Section 3.1.4 of [RFC5536]\n

        of the LIST\n   command.\n   The \"motd\" contains a \"message of the day\"
        relevant to the news\n   server.  It is intended to provide notification and
        communication\n   between the news administrator and the news user.  For instance,\n
        \  notification of upcoming downtime or information about new facilities\n
        \  available on the news server can be communicated via the LIST MOTD\n   command.\n
        \  The information is returned as a multi-line data block following the\n

        format although, like all multi-line data blocks, it is\n   \"dot-stuffed\".\n
        \  The server need not return the same information if this command is\n   used
        more than once in a session.  It MAY indeed send a different\n   message of
        the day depending on the state of the session.  For\n   instance, on a mode-switching
        news server, the information can be\n   different between its transit mode
        and its reader mode, or between an\n   authenticated session and an unauthenticated
        session.\n   The information MUST be in UTF-8 [RFC3629].\n   The motd is not
        newsgroup-based, and an argument MUST NOT be\n   specified.  Otherwise, a
        501 response code MUST be returned.\n   The motd MAY be empty.  If the server

        \  to the user.  No timestamp or date of last modification is provided\n   programmatically,
        although the news administrator may include one in\n   the text of the motd.
        \ The client MAY cache a local copy or\n   fingerprint of the motd so that
        it can display the message to the\n   user only upon modification.  If the
        client caches the information,\n   it MAY take into account only the motd
        obtained after reaching the\n   intended state of the session.  Nonetheless,
        in case a privacy\n   extension is used, the client MUST NOT cache any motd
        obtained before\n   that extension took effect.\n      NOTE: Though the client
        MAY cache the results of this command, it\n      MUST NOT rely on the correctness
        of any cached results, whether\n      from earlier in the session or from
        a previous session.  If the\n      motd is cached, the client SHOULD provide
        a way to force the\n      cached information to be refreshed.\n"

    - "3.1.  New Status Field Values\n   The LIST ACTIVE command is defined in Section
      7.6.3 of [RFC3977].\n   The fourth field of each line of this list indicates
      the current\n   status of the newsgroup whose name is specified in the first
      field.\n   Three status field values are defined in [RFC3977]:\n   \"y\"  Posting
      is permitted.\n   \"n\"  Posting is not permitted.\n   \"m\"  Postings will
      be forwarded to the newsgroup moderator.\n   This document defines three other
      case-sensitive status field values\n   that can also be used:\n   \"x\"  Postings
      and articles from peers are not permitted.\n   \"j\"  Only articles from peers
      are permitted; no articles are locally\n      filed.\n   \"=other.group\"  Only
      articles from peers are permitted, and are filed\n      under the newsgroup
      named \"other.group\".\n   The server SHOULD use these values when these meanings
      are required\n   and MUST NOT use them with any other meaning.\n   A newsgroup
      with status \"x\" is a newsgroup with status \"n\", except\n   that articles
      from peers are not accepted.  A newsgroup with status\n   \"x\" is considered
      as closed: no new articles will arrive in such a\n   group.  On the contrary,
      articles from peers will arrive in a\n   newsgroup with status \"n\".  Local
      postings are not allowed in a\n   newsgroup with either of these two status
      field values.\n   A newsgroup with status \"j\" is a newsgroup with status \"y\",
      except\n   that (1) local postings are not accepted, (2) articles received from\n
      \  a peer that are crossposted to one or more valid groups are filed\n   only
      into those valid groups, and (3) articles received from a peer\n   that are
      not crossposted to any valid groups are not filed into any\n   newsgroup, but
      are still propagated to other peers, if appropriate.\n      NOTE: Instead of
      not filing at all an article posted to a\n      newsgroup with status \"j\",
      a news server MAY file it under a\n      catch-all group if no valid group is
      applicable.  When a news\n      server uses a catch-all group to file the articles
      posted to\n      newsgroups with status \"j\", this catch-all group SHOULD be
      named\n      \"junk\".  (The first letter of the \"junk\" newsgroup explains
      why\n      this status has been called \"j\".)\n      Consequently, when a news
      server carries the \"junk\" newsgroup and\n      uses it for the purpose of
      the \"j\" status, the \"junk\" newsgroup\n      contains all postings not filed
      under another newsgroup,\n      regardless of the status of the \"junk\" newsgroup.
      \ (However, an\n      article posted explicitly to \"junk\" is treated according
      to the\n      status of the \"junk\" newsgroup.)\n      The \"junk\" newsgroup
      may be available to news readers and is often\n      used by a news server as
      a way to locally store an article that\n      will be transmitted to peers (which
      may carry some of the\n      newsgroups the article was posted to even if the
      local server does\n      not).  In addition, instead of rejecting an article
      that contains\n      an invalid Newsgroups header field or that is posted to
      newsgroups\n      it does not carry, a news server may accept such an article
      and\n      file it under the catch-all newsgroup.\n      Depending on the configuration
      of the news server, mentioning a\n      newsgroup with status \"j\" is different
      than simply not listing the\n      group, since articles arriving for unknown
      newsgroups may be\n      rejected.\n   When the status field value begins with
      an equal sign (\"=\" or %x3D),\n   a newsgroup name on the news server MUST
      immediately follow the sign.\n   If the status of \"foo.bar\" is \"=other.group\",
      it means that \"foo.bar\"\n   is an alias for \"other.group\".  These two newsgroups
      are distinct;\n   they do not share their articles or their article numbers.
      \ Local\n   postings to \"foo.bar\" are not allowed, but articles from peers
      are\n   accepted for \"foo.bar\" and filed into \"other.group\", regardless
      of\n   the status of \"other.group\".  The contents of their Newsgroups header\n
      \  fields MUST NOT be altered.\n   Alias groups are typically used during a
      transition between two\n   newsgroups, including but not limited to a renaming
      of a group, or a\n   correction of a misspelled group name.\n   The status of
      the newsgroup an alias points to MUST NOT be taken into\n   account when an
      article arrives in an alias newsgroup.  In\n   particular, it means that unapproved
      articles arriving from peers in\n   an alias pointing to a moderated newsgroup
      are accepted and filed\n   into this moderated newsgroup.  Therefore, an alias
      SHOULD NOT point\n   to a moderated newsgroup, since it allows bypassing of
      the\n   moderation.\n   An alias SHOULD NOT point to itself or another alias
      group.  The\n   newsgroup an alias points to SHOULD exist on the news server,
      and be\n   visible to any client that can see the original group.  However,
      when\n   a client issues a LIST ACTIVE command with a wildmat including the\n
      \  original group, the newsgroup it points to is not listed in the\n   response
      (unless of course the second newsgroup also matches the\n   wildmat).\n      NOTE:
      If a server files newsgroups with status \"j\" into \"junk\", a\n      newsgroup
      with status \"j\" and a newsgroup with status \"=junk\" are\n      different.
      \ An article fed by a peer, and crossposted to a group\n      with status \"j\",
      will result in the article being filed only in\n      \"junk\" if there are
      no other groups with which to file it, or\n      otherwise only in other valid
      newsgroups it is crossposted to.  On\n      the other hand, an article fed by
      a peer, and crossposted to a\n      group with status \"=junk\", will result
      in the article being filed\n      in \"junk\" and in other valid newsgroups
      it is crossposted to.\n   The following table summarizes what usually happens

  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   This section gives a formal definition of this extension
    as required\n   by Section 3.3.3 of [RFC3977] for the IANA registry.  It extends
    the\n   LIST capability label defined in Section 7.6 of [RFC3977].\n   o  This
    extension provides additional keywords to the pre-existing\n      LIST capability
    defined in Section 7.6 of [RFC3977].  New status\n      field values are also
    added to the ACTIVE variant of the LIST\n      command.\n   o  The capability
    label that this extension extends is \"LIST\".\n   o  This extension adds five
    optional arguments to the \"LIST\"\n      capability label: \"COUNTS\", \"DISTRIBUTIONS\",
    \"MODERATORS\", \"MOTD\",\n      and \"SUBSCRIPTIONS\", indicating which new variants
    of the LIST\n      command are supported.  Consequently, this extension associates\n
    \     these new arguments with the pre-existing \"LIST\" NNTP command.\n   o  This
    extension defines five new commands, LIST COUNTS, LIST\n      DISTRIBUTIONS, LIST
    MODERATORS, LIST MOTD, and LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS,\n      whose behavior, arguments,
    and responses are defined in\n      Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6, respectively.\n
    \  o  This extension does not associate any new responses with pre-\n      existing
    NNTP commands.\n   o  This extension does not affect the maximum length of commands
    or\n      initial response lines.\n   o  This extension does not alter pipelining.
    \ The LIST COUNTS, LIST\n      DISTRIBUTIONS, LIST MODERATORS, LIST MOTD, and
    LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS\n      commands can be pipelined.\n   o  Use of this extension
    does not alter the capabilities list.\n   o  This extension does not cause any
    pre-existing command to produce\n      a 401, 480, or 483 response.\n   o  This
    extension is unaffected by any use of the MODE READER\n      command.\n   o  This
    extension does not affect the overall behavior of a server or\n      client other
    than via the new commands.\n   o  Published Specification: This document.\n   o
