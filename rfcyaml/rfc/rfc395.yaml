  - "                    SWITCH SETTINGS ON IMPS AND TIPS\nThis note provides a description\
    \ of the switches on the front panel of\nIMPs and TIPs that are important to the\
    \ correct operation of the\nnetwork software.  We have had some difficulty in\
    \ the past when\ncertain of these switches were set incorrectly, This RFC will\
    \ be\nupdated as necessary, to notify site personnel of changes to the\nsettings.\n\
    A.  516 IMPs\n    --------\nThe IMP at your site is a model 516 if it has a gray\
    \ cabinet and two\nrows of indicator lights on the front panel.  The correct switch\n\
    settings are:\n     1.   Sense switches 1,2,3 and 4:  OFF (DOWN)\n     2.   PFI/PFH:\
    \  PFI (UP)\n     3.   HALT INH:  OFF (DOWN)\n     4.   W.D.T.:  OFF (DOWN)\n\
    \     5.   AUTO RSTRT:  ON (UP)\n     6.   MEMORY PRTCT:  OFF (DOWN)\nB.  316\
    \ IMPs and TIPs\n    -----------------\nThe IMP at your site is a model 316 if\
    \ it is a TIP or if it is in a\nblack cabinet and has one row of indicator lights\
    \ on the front panel.\n     1.  Sense switches 1,2,3,4 OFF  (top half depressed)\n\
    Site personnel are requested to keep a copy of this RFC near the IMP\nand to check\
    \ the switch settings at their IMP.  In addition, the\nHoneywell field engineers\
    \ who perform preventive maintenance have been\nrequested to use this note as\
    \ a checklist.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry\
    \ ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n      \
