  - "Abstract\n   This document defines extensions to the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol\n
    \  (L2TP) for enhanced support of link-specific Point to Point Protocol\n   (PPP)
    options.  PPP endpoints typically have direct access to the\n   common physical
    media connecting them and thus have detailed\n   knowledge about the media that
    is in use.  When the L2TP is used, the\n   two PPP peers are no longer directly
    connected over the same physical\n   media.  Instead, L2TP inserts a virtual connection
    over some or all\n   of the PPP connection by tunneling PPP frames over a packet
    switched\n   network such as IP.  Under some conditions, an L2TP endpoint may
    need\n   to negotiate PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) options at a location\n
    \  which may not have access to all of the media information necessary\n   for
    proper participation in the LCP negotiation.  This document\n   provides a mechanism
    for communicating desired LCP options between\n   L2TP endpoints in advance of
    PPP LCP negotiation at the far end of an\n   L2TP tunnel, as well as a mechanism
    for communicating the negotiated\n   LCP options back to where the native PPP
    link resides.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   L2TP [RFC2661] provides a very limited amount of guidance
    to the LNS\n   as to what type of interface a tunneled PPP session arrived on
    at an\n   LAC.  Such information is limited to whether the interface was\n   \"synchronous\"
    or \"asynchronous\", \"digital\" or \"analog.\"  These\n   indications provide
    some guidance when negotiating PPP LCP at the\n   LNS, but they are not as robust
    as they could be.\n   This document defines a more robust way to inform the LAC
    of LCP\n   negotiated options, and provides guidance to the LNS on the limits\n
    \  and values that the LAC requires during LCP negotiation.  Deep\n   knowledge
    of PPP [RFC1661] and L2TP [RFC2661] are expected for the\n   remainder of this
    document.\n   L2TP Proxy LCP allows options to be negotiated where the native
    PPP\n   link resides, thus circumventing issues with ACCM, Alternate FCS, and\n
    \  other LCP Options that the LNS would not necessarily know how to\n   properly
    negotiate without access to the physical media for the\n   native PPP connection,
    interface type, or configuration.  However,\n   use of Proxy LCP introduces other
    problems as well as there are\n   options within LCP PPP negotiation which should
    be set or adjusted by\n   the LNS, such as the PPP Authentication Type and MRU.
    \ Finally, the\n   PPP Client may reinitiate LCP negotiation at any time, and
    unless the\n   LAC is sniffing every PPP data packet it forwards, it would not
    be\n   aware that this is even occurring.\n   LCP options may be classified into
    roughly three different categories\n   with respect to their affect on L2TP; (1)
    options which affect\n   framing in a way that the LAC may need to know about
    or handle\n   specifically (e.g., ALT-FCS, ACCM, MRU), (2) options that are mostly\n
    \  transparent to the LAC (e.g., AUTH-TYPE), and (3) options that the\n   LAC
    may wish to influence because they are dependent on the media\n   type (ACFC,
    PFC).  We are most concerned with options that fall into\n   category (1) and
    (3).\n   This document defines new AVPs to allow the LAC and the LNS to\n   communicate
    complete LCP information in order to react accordingly.\n   LCP option information
    is structured in the same way as the Proxy LCP\n   AVPs are in [RFC2661].  This
    essentially involves encapsulation of a\n   PPP LCP Configure-Request or Configure-Ack
    packet within an L2TP AVP.\n"

  - "2. LCP Options From LAC to LNS\n   The LAC may utilize the following AVPs within
    an ICCN or OCCN message\n   in order to influence the LNS to negotiate LCP in
    a specific manner.\n   If these AVPs are supported by the LNS, they should override
    any\n   suggestions for LCP options implied by the Bearer Type or Framing\n   Type
    AVPs.\n   These AVPs may coexist with the Proxy LCP and Proxy Authentication\n
    \  AVPs (Proxy AVPs) defined in the base L2TP specification.  If Proxy\n   AVPs
    are received, the LNS may choose to accept these parameters, or\n   renegotiate
    LCP with the options suggested by the AVPs defined in\n   this document.  If the
    LAC wishes to force negotiation of LCP by the\n   LNS, it should simply omit all
    Proxy AVPs during call initialization.\n   By default, the AVPs defined in this
    document are not mandatory (M-\n   bit is set to zero).  However, if an implementation
    needs to strongly\n   enforce adherence to the options defined within the AVPs,
    it MAY set\n   the M-bit to 1, thus forcing the peer to discontinue the session
    if\n   it does not support this AVP.  This is NOT recommended unless it is\n   known
    that the result of operating without these extensions is\n   completely unacceptable.\n
    \  If the AVPs in sections 2.1 and 2.2 are sent to the LNS, the LAC MUST\n   be
    prepared to accept the AVPs as defined in section 2.3.\n"
