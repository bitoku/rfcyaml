- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In certain networks, there is dependency on the edge-to-edge Label\n\
    \   Switched Paths (LSPs) setup by the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP),\n  \
    \ e.g., networks that are used for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\n   Virtual\
    \ Private Network (VPN) applications.  For such applications,\n   it is not possible\
    \ to rely on Internet Protocol (IP) forwarding if\n   the MPLS LSP is not operating\
    \ appropriately.  Blackholing of labeled\n   traffic can occur in situations where\
    \ the Interior Gateway Protocol\n   (IGP) is operational on a link on which LDP\
    \ is not.  While the link\n   could still be used for IP forwarding, it is not\
    \ useful for MPLS\n   forwarding, for example, MPLS VPN applications or Border\
    \ Gateway\n   Protocol (BGP) route-free cores.  This document describes a mechanism\n\
    \   to avoid traffic loss due to this condition without introducing any\n   protocol\
    \ changes.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   LDP [RFC5036] establishes MPLS LSPs along the shortest path\
    \ to a\n   destination as determined by IP forwarding.  In a common network\n\
    \   design, LDP is used to provide Label Switched Paths throughout the\n   complete\
    \ network domain covered by an IGP such as Open Shortest Path\n   First (OSPF)\
    \ [RFC2328] or Intermediate System to Intermediate System\n   (IS-IS) [ISO.10589.1992];\
    \ i.e., all links in the domain have IGP as\n   well as LDP adjacencies.\n   A\
    \ variety of services a network provider may want to deploy over an\n   LDP-enabled\
    \ network depend on the availability of edge-to-edge label\n   switched paths.\
    \  In a layer 2 (L2) or layer 3 (L3) VPN scenario, for\n   example, a given Provider-Edge\
    \ (PE) router relies on the availability\n   of a complete MPLS forwarding path\
    \ to the other PE routers for the\n   VPNs it serves.  This means that all the\
    \ links along the IP shortest\n   path from one PE router to the other need to\
    \ have operational LDP\n   sessions, and the necessary label binding must have\
    \ been exchanged\n   over those sessions.  If only one link along the IP shortest\
    \ path is\n   not covered by an LDP session, a blackhole exists and services\n\
    \   depending on MPLS forwarding will fail.  This might be a transient or\n  \
    \ a persistent error condition.  Some of the reasons for this could be:\n   -\
    \ A configuration error.\n   - An implementation bug.\n   - The link has just\
    \ come up and has an IGP adjacency but LDP has\n     either not yet established\
    \ an adjacency or session, or has not yet\n     distributed all the label bindings.\n\
    \   The LDP protocol has currently no way to correct the issue.  LDP is\n   not\
    \ a routing protocol; it cannot re-direct traffic to an alternate\n   IGP path.\n"

- title: 2.  Proposed Solution
  contents:
  - "2.  Proposed Solution\n   The problem described above exists because LDP is tied\
    \ to\n   IP-forwarding decisions but no coupling between the IGP and LDP\n   operational\
    \ state on a given link exists.  If IGP is operational on a\n   link but LDP is\
    \ not, a potential network problem exists.  So the\n   solution described by this\
    \ document is to discourage a link from\n   being used for IP forwarding as long\
    \ as LDP is not fully operational.\n   This has some similarity to the mechanism\
    \ specified in [RFC3137],\n   which allows an OSPF router to advertise that it\
    \ should not be used\n   as a transit router.  One difference is that [RFC3137]\
    \ raises the\n   link costs on all (stub) router links, while the mechanism described\n\
    \   here applies on a per-link basis.\n   In detail: when LDP is not \"fully operational\"\
    \ (see below) on a given\n   link, the IGP will advertise the link with maximum\
    \ cost to avoid any\n   transit traffic over it.  In the case of OSPF, this cost\
    \ is\n   LSInfinity (16-bit value 0xFFFF), as proposed in [RFC3137].  In the\n\
    \   case of ISIS, the maximum metric value is 2^24-2 (0xFFFFFE).  Indeed,\n  \
    \ if a link is configured with 2^24-1 (the maximum link metric per\n   [RFC5305]),\
    \ then this link is not advertised in the topology.  It is\n   important to keep\
    \ the link in the topology to allow IP traffic to use\n   the link as a last resort\
    \ in case of massive failure.\n   LDP is considered fully operational on a link\
    \ when an LDP hello\n   adjacency exists on it, a suitable associated LDP session\
    \ (matching\n   the LDP Identifier of the hello adjacency) is established to the\
    \ peer\n   at the other end of the link, and all label bindings have been\n  \
    \ exchanged over the session.  At the present time, the latter\n   condition cannot\
    \ generally be verified by a router and some\n   estimation may have to be used.\
    \  A simple implementation strategy is\n   to use a configurable hold-down timer\
    \ to allow LDP session\n   establishment before declaring LDP fully operational.\
    \  The default\n   timer is not defined in this document due to concerns of the\
    \ large\n   variations of the Label Information Base (LIB) table size and\n  \
    \ equipment capabilities.  In addition, there is a current work in\n   progress\
    \ on LDP End-of-LIB as specified in [End-of-LIB], which\n   enables the LDP speaker\
    \ to signal the completion of its initial\n   advertisement following session\
    \ establishment.  When LDP End-of-LIB\n   is implemented, the configurable hold-down\
    \ timer is no longer needed.\n   The neighbor LDP session is considered fully\
    \ operational when the\n   End-of-LIB notification message is received.\n   This\
    \ is typically sufficient to deal with the link when it is being\n   brought up.\
    \  LDP protocol extensions to indicate the complete\n   transmission of all currently\
    \ available label bindings after a\n   session has come up are conceivable, but\
    \ not addressed in this\n   document.\n   The mechanism described in this document\
    \ does not entail any protocol\n   changes and is a local implementation issue.\n\
    \   The problem space and solution specified in this document have also\n   been\
    \ discussed in an IEEE Communications Magazine paper\n   [LDP-Fail-Rec].\n"
- title: 3.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability\n   In general, the proposed procedure is applicable in networks\
    \ where\n   the availability of LDP-signaled MPLS LSPs and avoidance of\n   blackholes\
    \ for MPLS traffic are more important than always choosing\n   an optimal path\
    \ for IP-forwarded traffic.  Note however that non-\n   optimal IP forwarding\
    \ only occurs for a short time after a link comes\n   up or when there is a genuine\
    \ problem on a link.  In the latter case,\n   an implementation should issue network\
    \ management alerts to report\n   the error condition and enable the operator\
    \ to address it.\n   Example network scenarios that benefit from the mechanism\
    \ described\n   here are MPLS VPNs and BGP-free core network designs where traffic\n\
    \   can only be forwarded through the core when LDP forwarding state is\n   available\
    \ throughout.\n   The usefulness of this mechanism also depends on the availability\
    \ of\n   alternate paths with sufficient bandwidth in the network should one\n\
    \   link be assigned to the maximum cost due to the unavailability of LDP\n  \
    \ service over it.\n   On broadcast links with more than one IGP/LDP peer, the\
    \ cost-out\n   procedure can only be applied to the link as a whole and not to\
    \ an\n   individual peer.  So a policy decision has to be made whether the\n \
    \  unavailability of LDP service to one peer should result in the\n   traffic\
    \ being diverted away from all the peers on the link.\n"
- title: 4.  Interaction with TE Tunnels
  contents:
  - "4.  Interaction with TE Tunnels\n   In some networks, LDP is used in conjunction\
    \ with RSVP-TE, which sets\n   up traffic-engineered tunnels.  The path computation\
    \ for the TE\n   tunnels is based on the TE link cost that is flooded by the IGP\
    \ in\n   addition to the regular IP link cost.  The mechanism described in\n \
    \  this document should only be applied to the IP link cost to prevent\n   unnecessary\
    \ TE tunnel reroutes.\n   In order to establish LDP LSPs across a TE tunnel, a\
    \ targeted LDP\n   session between the tunnel endpoints needs to exist.  This\
    \ presents a\n   problem very similar to the case of a regular LDP session over\
    \ a link\n   (the case discussed so far): when the TE tunnel is used for IP\n\
    \   forwarding, the targeted LDP session needs to be operational to avoid\n  \
    \ LDP connectivity problems.  Again, raising the IP cost of the tunnel\n   while\
    \ there is no operational LDP session will solve the problem.\n   When there is\
    \ no IGP adjacency over the tunnel and the tunnel is not\n   advertised as a link\
    \ into the IGP, this becomes a local issue of the\n   tunnel headend router.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack that brings\
    \ down LDP service on a\n   link or prevents it from becoming operational on a\
    \ link could be one\n   possible cause of LDP-related traffic blackholing.  This\
    \ document\n   does not address how to prevent LDP session failure.  The mechanism\n\
    \   described here prevents the use of the link where LDP is not\n   operational\
    \ while IGP is.  Assigning the IGP cost to maximum on such\n   a link should not\
    \ introduce new security threats.  The operation is\n   internal to the router\
    \ to allow LDP and IGP to communicate and react.\n   Making many LDP links unavailable,\
    \ however, is a security threat that\n   can cause dropped traffic due to limited\
    \ available network capacity.\n   This may be triggered by operational error or\
    \ implementation error.\n   These errors are considered general security issues\
    \ and implementors\n   should follow the current best security practice [MPLS-GMPLS-Sec].\n"
