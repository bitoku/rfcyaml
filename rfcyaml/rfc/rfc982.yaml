  - "Status of This Memo\n   The following is a RFC edition of the ANSI \"Guidelines\
    \ for the\n   Specification of the Structure of the Domain Specific Part (DSP)\
    \ of\n   the ISO Standard NSAP Address\".  It should be understood that this\n\
    \   ANSI working document is in a draft state and subject to change.\n   These\
    \ Guidelines are an important prerequirement to allow IP\n   addressing within\
    \ the ISO connectionless protocol (CLNS), which\n   itself is necessary to allow\
    \ the coexistance of the IP and the CLNS\n   in the Arpanet attached gateways.\n\
    \   A RFC to specify a suitable IP addressing method for ISOgrams is\n   currently\
    \ worked on in Internet Task Forces and should be expected as\n   an RFC shortly.\n\
    \   This RFC is for informational purposes only  and  it's distribution\n   is\
    \ unlimited. It does not specify a standard for the Arpa-Internet.\n"

  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   There is a substantial amount of interest in providing guidance\
    \ to\n   private address administration authorities on preferred formats and\n\
    \   semantics for the Domain Specific Part (DSP) of an NSAP address.  In\n   particular\
    \ it is felt that use of a limited number of preferred DSP\n   formats would allow\
    \ organizations to easily use intermediate and end\n   systems from a variety\
    \ of suppliers.  This technical report specifies\n   the way in which the DSP\
    \ may be constructed so as to facilitate\n   efficient address assignment.\n"

  - "5.  Addressing Principles\n   This section provides a summary of the major points\
    \ contained in DIS\n   8348/DAD2, as they are relevant to this technical report.\n\
    \   Network addresses are defined to be hierarchical.  An authority may\n   either\
    \ assign a complete address, or else may identify a subdomain of\n   its own addressing\
    \ domain within which addresses may be further\n   assigned by an identified authority\
    \ for the subdomain.  This is done\n   in such a way that all addresses are unique.\n\
    \   When an authority identifies a subdomain, this creates in effect a\n   prefix\
    \ which applies to all addresses assigned within the subdomain.\n   Certain methods\
    \ of assigning authority are recognized within the body\n   of DIS 8348/DAD 2.\
    \  These take account of existing addressing\n   standards such as X.121.  The\
    \ abstract structure of an address is\n   shown in Figure 1.\n"
