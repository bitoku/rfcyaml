Abstract This document specifies encoding of extensions to the IS IS routing protocol in support of Generalized Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS).
This document specifies extensions to the IS IS routing protocol in support of carrying link state information for Generalized Multi  Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS).
The set of required enhancements to IS IS are outlined in [GMPLS ROUTING].
Support for unnumbered interfaces assumes support for the "Point to Point Three Way Adjacency
" IS IS Option type [ISIS 3way].
In this section we define the enhancements to the Traffic Engineering (TE) properties of GMPLS TE links that can be announced in IS IS Link State Protocol Data Units.
In this document, we enhance the sub TLVs for the extended IS reachability TLV (see [ISIS TE]) in support of GMPLS.
Specifically, we add the following sub TLVs:
We further add one new TLV to the TE TLVs:
variable  Shared Risk Link Group
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
Local Interface Identifiers is a sub TLV of the extended IS reachability TLV.
The type of this sub TLV is 4, and length is eight octets.
The value field of this sub TLV contains four octets of Link Local Identifier followed by four octets of Link Remote Identifier (see Section "Support for unnumbered links" of [GMPLS ROUTING]).
If the Link Remote Identifier is unknown, it is set to 0.
The following illustrates encoding of the Value field of the Link Local/Remote Identifiers sub TLV. 0
The Link Local/Remote Identifiers sub TLV MUST NOT occur more than once within the extended IS reachability TLV.
If the Link Local/Remote Identifiers sub TLV occurs more than once within the extended IS reachability TLV, the receiver SHOULD ignore all these sub TLVs.
The Link Protection Type is a sub TLV (of type 20) of the extended IS reachability TLV, with length two octets.
The following illustrates encoding of the Value field of the Link Protection Type sub TLV. 0
1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5    Protection Cap
The first octet is a bit vector describing the protection capabilities of the link (see Section "Link Protection Type" of [GMPLS ROUTING]).
The second octet SHOULD be set to zero by the sender, and SHOULD be ignored by the receiver.
The Link Protection Type sub
TLV MUST NOT occur more than once within the extended IS reachability TLV.
If the Link Protection Type sub  TLV occurs more than once within the extended IS reachability TLV, the receiver SHOULD ignore all these sub TLVs.
Interface Switching Capability Descriptor The Interface Switching Capability Descriptor is a sub TLV (of type 21) of
the extended IS reachability TLV.
The length is the length of value field in octets.
The following illustrates encoding of the Value field of the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor sub TLV. 0
(L2SC) 100   Time Division Multiplex Capable (TDM)
The Encoding field contains one of the values specified in Section 3.1.1 of [GMPLS SIG].
Maximum LSP Bandwidth is encoded as a list of eight 4 octet fields in the IEEE floating point format [IEEE], with priority 0 first and priority 7 last.
The units are bytes (not bits!)
The content of the Switching Capability specific information field depends on the value of the Switching Capability field.
The Minimum LSP Bandwidth is encoded in a 4 octets field in the IEEE floating point format.
The units are bytes (not bits!)
The Interface MTU is encoded as a 2 octets integer, and carries the MTU value in the units of bytes.
When the Switching Capability field is L2SC, there is no Switching Capability specific information field present.
The Minimum LSP Bandwidth is encoded in a 4 octets field in the IEEE floating point format.
The units are bytes (not bits!)
The indication whether the interface supports Standard or Arbitrary SONET/SDH is encoded as 1 octet.
The value of this octet is 0 if the interface supports Standard SONET/SDH, and 1 if the interface supports Arbitrary SONET/SDH.
When the Switching Capability field is LSC, there is no Switching Capability specific information field present.
To support interfaces that have more than one Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (see Section "Interface Switching Capability Descriptor" of [GMPLS ROUTING])
the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor sub TLV MAY occur more than once within the extended IS reachability TLV.
Shared Risk Link Group TLV
The SRLG TLV (of type 138) contains a data structure consisting of: 6 octets of System ID 1 octet of Pseudonode Number 1
octet Flag 4 octets of IPv4 interface address or 4 octets of a Link Local Identifier 4 octets of IPv4 neighbor address or 4 octets of a Link Remote Identifier (variable) list of SRLG values, where each element in the list has 4 octets.
The following illustrates encoding of the Value field of the SRLG TLV. 0
Shared Risk Link Group Value
Shared Risk Link Group Value
The neighbor is identified by its System Id (6 octets), plus one octet to indicate the pseudonode number if the neighbor is on a LAN interface.
The Least Significant Bit of the Flag octet indicates whether the interface is numbered (set to 1), or unnumbered (set to 0).
All other bits are reserved and should be set to 0.
The length of this TLV is 16
This TLV carries the Shared Risk Link Group information (see Section "Shared Risk Link Group Information" of [GMPLS ROUTING]).
The SRLG TLV MAY occur more than once within the IS
IS Link State Protocol Data Units.
Link Identifier for Unnumbered Interfaces Link Identifiers are exchanged in the Extended Local Circuit ID field of the "Point to Point Three Way Adjacency
" IS IS Option type [ISIS 3way].
The restarting node SHOULD follow the ISIS restart procedures [ISIS RESTART], and the RSVP TE restart procedures [GMPLS RSVP].
When the restarting node is going to originate its IS IS Link State Protocol data units for TE links, these Link State Protocol data units SHOULD be originated with 0 unreserved bandwidth, Traffic Engineering Default metric set to 0xffffff, and if the link has LSC or FSC as its Switching Capability then also with 0 as Max LSP Bandwidth, until the node is able to determine the amount of unreserved resources taking into account the resources reserved by the already established LSPs that have been preserved across the restart.
Once the restarting node determines the amount of unreserved resources, taking into account the resources reserved by the already established LSPs that have been preserved across the restart,
the node SHOULD advertise these resources in its Link State Protocol data units.
In addition, in the case of a planned restart prior to restarting, the restarting node SHOULD originate the IS IS Link State Protocol data units for TE links with 0 as unreserved bandwidth, and if the link has LSC or FSC as its Switching Capability then also with 0 as Max LSP Bandwidth.
This would discourage new LSP establishment through the restarting router.
Neighbors of the restarting node SHOULD continue to advertise the actual unreserved bandwidth on the TE links from the neighbors to that node.

This document specifies the contents of GMPLS TE TLVs in ISIS.
As these TLVs are not used for SPF computation or normal routing, the extensions specified here have no direct effect on IP routing.
Tampering with GMPLS TE TLVs may have an effect on the underlying transport (optical and/or SONET SDH) network.
Mechanisms to secure ISIS Link State PDUs and/or the TE TLVs [ISIS HMAC] can be used to secure the GMPLS TE TLVs as well.
This document defines the following new ISIS TLV type that needs to be reflected in the ISIS TLV code point registry:
Shared Risk Link Group    n
