- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Structured Query Language (SQL) has been in use for\
    \ over 30 years\n   with various types of database technologies.  However, there\
    \ is no\n   current media type registered for SQL.  Therefore, this document\n\
    \   seeks to formally register the application/sql media type to be used\n   for\
    \ SQL with IANA.\n"

- title: 3.  Media Type Registration Application
  contents:
  - "3.  Media Type Registration Application\n   This section provides the media type\
    \ registration application for\n   this media type (see [RFC6838], Section 5.6)\n\
    \   Type name: application\n   Subtype name: sql\n   Required parameters: N/A\n\
    \   Optional parameters:\n      \"charset\" -- indicates the character set to\
    \ be used.  When not\n      specified, a default value MUST NOT be assumed without\
    \ inspection\n      of the content.\n      Implementors should be aware that SQL\
    \ may carry character set\n      information in-band.  In such cases, the \"charset\"\
    \ parameter MUST\n      NOT be used in order to avoid conflict.  In cases where\
    \ no\n      character set information is supplied in-band, and the character\n\
    \      set is known, implementors SHOULD use the \"charset\" parameter.  If\n\
    \      no in-band or out-of-band character set information is available,\n   \
    \   implementors MUST NOT specify the \"charset\" parameter.\n   Encoding considerations:\n\
    \      If the \"charset\" parameter is used, the corresponding 7-bit,\n      8-bit,\
    \ or binary encoding may be used.  If the \"charset\" parameter\n      is not\
    \ used, binary encoding may be required.\n   Security considerations:\n      Being\
    \ that SQL is a full-fledged programming language and may\n      include embedded\
    \ source code for other programming languages,\n      there is a risk of it being\
    \ used to transfer malware, viruses, and\n      other malicious payloads.  Implementors\
    \ and users are encouraged\n      only to exchange SQL files among trusted parties\
    \ and utilize all\n      available security measures, such as restricted access,\
    \ virus\n      scanners, etc., to minimize risk.\n      Implementors should be\
    \ aware that guessing character sets,\n      encodings, and possible conflicts\
    \ between in-band and out-of-band\n      character set information may lead to\
    \ the similar security issues\n      as described above.\n      Implementors should\
    \ also be aware that SQL does not provide or\n      guarantee any sort of confidentiality\
    \ and integrity checking, and\n      SQL files can expose account information\
    \ or private information\n      about database structure and contents.  It is\
    \ therefore important\n      for applications to provide confidentiality and protection\
    \ against\n      modification by malicious third parties while in transit.\n \
    \  Interoperability considerations:\n      While a single standard exists ([ISO.9075.2011]),\
    \ vendor\n      implementations of the standard vary significantly.  Implementors\n\
    \      and users should make sure that the exchanged SQL files match to\n    \
    \  the specific database/tool and version that they are using.\n   Published specification:\n\
    \      The most recent specification of SQL is available in\n      [ISO.9075.2011].\n\
    \   Applications that use this media type:\n      Databases and related tools\n\
    \   Fragment identifier considerations: N/A\n   Additional information:\n    \
    \  Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A\n      Magic number(s): N/A\n   \
    \   File extension(s): sql\n      Macintosh File Type Code(s): N/A\n   Person\
    \ & email address to contact for further information:\n      Yakov Shafranovich\

    \ tree only): N/A\n"
