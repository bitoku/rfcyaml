    \                          Scheme\n   There have been several proposals for schemes\
    \ to allow the use of a\n   single Internet network number to refer to a collection\
    \ of physical\n   networks under common administration which are reachable from\
    \ the rest\n   of the Internet by a common route.  Such schemes allow a simplified\
    \ view\n   of an otherwise complicated topology from hosts and gateways outside\
    \ of\n   this collection.  They allow the complexity of the number and  type of\n\
    \   these networks, and routing to them, to be localized.  Additions and\n   changes\
    \ in configuration thus cause no detectable change, and no\n   interruption of\
    \ service, due to slow propagation of routing and other\n   information outside\
    \ of the local environment.  These schemes also\n   simplify the administration\
    \ of the network, as changes do not require\n   allocation of new network numbers\
    \ for each new cable installed.  This\n   proposal discusses an alternative scheme,\
    \ one that has been in use at\n   the University of California, Berkeley since\
    \ April 1984.  This RFC\n   suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet\
    \ community, and\n   requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n"

    \ to new\n   recipients, without a decapsulation process (which this memo terms\n\

    \   because they can not be distributed, forwarded, replied-to, or otherwise\n\
    \   processed as separate individual messages. In order to burst a message\n \
    \  it is necessary to know how the component messages were encapsulated in\n \

    \ of treating a set of local area networks (LANs) as one\n   Internet network\
    \ has generated some interest and concern.  It is\n   inappropriate to give each\
    \ LAN within an site a distinct Internet\n   network number.  It is desirable\
    \ to hide the details of the\n   interconnections between the LANs within an site\
    \ from people, gateways,\n   and hosts outside the site.  The question arises\
    \ on how to best do this,\n   and even how to do it at all.  In RFC-917 Jeffery\
    \ Mogul makes a case for\n   the use of \"explicit subnets\" in a multi-LAN environment.\
    \  The explicit\n   subnet scheme is a call to recursively apply the mechanisms\
    \ the Internet\n   uses to manage networks to the problem of managing LANs within\
    \ one\n   network.  In this note I urge another approach: the use of \"transparent\n\

    \ convenient to be able to bootstrap a computer system from a\n   communications\
    \ network.  This RFC proposes the use of the IP TFTP\n   protocol for bootstrap\
    \ loading in this case.\n"

    \ address (e.g., their attached physical network address).\n   This RFC specifies\

    \ of this memo is to explain how protocol standards are\n   adopted for the ARPA-Internet\
    \ and the DARPA research community.  There\n   are three important aspects to\
    \ be discussed:  the process, the\n   authority, and the complex relationship\
    \ between the DARPA community and\n   the DDN community.  This memo is a policy\
    \ statement on how protocols\n   become official standards for the ARPA-Internet\
    \ and the DARPA research\n   community.  This is an official policy statement\
    \ of the ICCB and the\n   DARPA.\n"
