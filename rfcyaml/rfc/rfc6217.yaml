- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 919 [1] defines a method for broadcasting packets to\
    \ a local\n   network.  It assumes that data link layers support efficient\n \
    \  broadcasting.  In the years since RFC 919 was written, Local Area\n   Networks\
    \ have grown exponentially in size, and frequently they are\n   not geographically\
    \ local.\n   This RFC proposes a new data link layer that scales efficiently to\
    \ a\n   geographically local network and, depending on visibility, to an\n   entire\
    \ Metropolitan Area Network.  By using a different transmission\n   medium, the\
    \ broadcast traffic does not impact current inter- or\n   intra-network routed\
    \ traffic.  It also makes use of a widely\n   available infrastructure that is\
    \ in use in all major cities and,\n   surprisingly, rural and under-developed\
    \ locations as well.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119.\n"
- title: 3.  Limitations
  contents:
  - "3.  Limitations\n   This RFC does not propose solutions to all problems.  Just\
    \ as RFC 919\n   was unconcerned with reliability, we also do not guarantee that\
    \ hosts\n   receive datagrams sent.  Hosts may not receive packets for a variety\n\
    \   of reasons, among them weather conditions, line of sight, sleep\n   patterns,\
    \ and distraction.  A best-effort delivery approach is taken.\n   These limitations\
    \ do impact the usefulness of the proposal, but\n   organizations serious about\
    \ distributing information in this fashion\n   can overcome these obstacles with\
    \ relatively little difficulty.\n"
- title: 4.  Physical Layer
  contents:
  - "4.  Physical Layer\n   The physical layer used is made up primarily of nitrogen\
    \ and oxygen,\n   at a pressure of 101.3 kilopascal at sea level, but dropping\
    \ to about\n   half that pressure at operating altitudes.  Microscopic residue\
    \ or\n   trace elements may exist in the transmission medium, depending on\n \
    \  local formation properties.\n   This residue may include argon, carbon dioxide,\
    \ neon, helium,\n   chloride anions, sulfur dioxide, and other molecules occurring\
    \ at\n   very low mixtures.  It is common for there to be some degree of\n   gaseous\
    \ dihydrogen monoxide present.  These trace molecules usually\n   do not impede\
    \ the broadcast, although further details on datagram\n   transmission follow.\n"
- title: 5.  Frame Format in the OSI Model
  contents:
  - "5.  Frame Format in the OSI Model\n   It is always a challenge to design a protocol\
    \ that allows enough\n   flexibility for future adaptation while keeping it efficient\
    \ in size\n   -- and for this medium, size and complexity of the header are of\n\
    \   particular concern.  For this reason, this RFC proposes\n   recommendations\
    \ for the Data Link, Network, and Transport Layers.\n   Implementations MAY use\
    \ any protocol that fits their needs for the\n   Network and Transport Layers.\
    \  They SHOULD consider how different\n   protocols may be interpreted by recipients\
    \ of the message and choose\n   the most effective protocol available.  The protocols\
    \ defined have\n   been designed to allow maximum ease of interpretation, so their\
    \ use\n   is encouraged.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Data Link Layer
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Data Link Layer\n   The Data Link Layer is primarily concerned with transmitting\n\
    \   datagrams between adjacent nodes, and it is unnecessary here since we\n  \
    \ only support broadcast transmission.  Implementers MUST NOT\n   encapsulate\
    \ packets in a link layer protocol.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Network Layer
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Network Layer\n   When designing a protocol for the Network Layer, it makes\
    \ sense to\n   consider existing protocols in this layer and reference their\n\
    \   strengths and weaknesses.  Looking at IPv4/6, we can see their header\n  \
    \ structures include several fields unnecessary for our purposes:\n   Destination,\
    \ TTL (Time to Live), DSCP (Diffserv Code Point), ECN\n   (Explicit Congestion\
    \ Notification), Hop Limits, and so on.  We can\n   design a much more compact\
    \ protocol thusly:\n      +-------------------------------+-----------------------------+\n\
    \      |            Content            |           Source            |\n     \

    \           Figure 1: Layout of the Datagram\n   Content - A variable-length field\
    \ containing the encapsulation of\n   higher-level protocols.\n   Source - The\
    \ sender of the message.  A transmission MUST choose one\n   of the following\
    \ representations of the source:\n      - IPv4 address in dot-decimal notation\
    \ (e.g., 192.168.1.1)\n      - IPv6 address in standard notation (RFC 5952 [2])\n\
    \      - telephone number in E.123 notation\n      - electronic mail address in\
    \ E.123 notation\n      - Uniform Resource Identifier (RFC 3986 [3])\n      -\
    \ geographic address\n   The Source field MUST be present -- to send a message\
    \ anonymously, a\n   sender MUST use one of the reserved entries of the different\
    \ types.\n   Reserved Entries for telephone numbers vary by region; for example,\n\
    \   in North America they are 555-0100 to 555-0199.  Reserved entries for\n  \
    \ IPv4 (RFC 5735 [4]), IPv6 (RFC 5156 [5]), and URIs (RFC 2606 [6]) may\n   be\
    \ found in their respective RFCs.  The concept of a region defined\n   by homogeneous\
    \ communication characteristics has been put forward\n   already in [7], so geographic\
    \ addressing ambiguities may be resolved\n   by community standards.\n   Because\
    \ the message is sent to a specific geographical region, more\n   leniency is\
    \ available in source addressing, but requirements may be\n   imposed by higher-level\
    \ protocols.\n   We call this protocol the Asynchronous Dumb Visual Exchange of\
    \ Raw\n   Transmissions or ADVERT.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Transport Layer
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Transport Layer\n   Similar to the Network Layer, a Transport Layer protocol\
    \ is able to\n   omit several constructs that are used in existing Transport Layer\n\
    \   protocols.  Consider TCP -- sequence, acknowledgement, and many of\n   the\
    \ flags are discarded as there will be no SYN, SYN/ACK, or ACK\n   handshake in\
    \ a broadcast message.  Likewise, fields such as Window\n   Size and Urgent --\
    \ created primarily as a benefit to router\n   manufacturers -- are unnecessary\
    \ in this medium.\n   In fact, in the event of a plain text message, content SHOULD\
    \ be\n   embedded directly in the ADVERT Protocol without the need of a\n   transport\
    \ protocol.  Consider the following packet:\n              Content           \
    \               Source\n   +------------------------------------------------------------+\n\

    \                 Figure 2: Example ADVERT Datagram\n   For UTF-encoded payloads,\
    \ one SHOULD use the default UTF-encoding so\n   the packet is human-readable.\
    \  This will minimize accidental\n   misinterpretation.  This transmission structure\
    \ lends itself most\n   easily to human-parsable messages.\n   For messages intended\
    \ to be responded to by a computer (for example,\n   binary content), a Transport\
    \ Layer protocol MUST be used, and an\n   implementer SHOULD use UDP, as it is\
    \ one of the more compact\n   protocols available in this layer.  An implementer\
    \ SHOULD encode the\n   UDP ports, length, and checksum in base-10 (leading zeros\
    \ omitted)\n   and the data in Base64 encoding.  The Base64 encoding, combined\
    \ with\n   the UDP checksum, resolves ambiguities with trailing whitespace or\n\
    \   non-printable characters.\n   The usage of UDP or other protocols that compute\
    \ a checksum over\n   source and destination addresses necessitates the use of\
    \ either an\n   IPv4 or IPv6 address as the Source in the ADVERT Protocol.  The\n\
    \   Destination address 255.255.255.255 MUST be used in the calculation\n   of\
    \ an IPv4-based checksum, as it has already been specified as a\n   local hardware\
    \ broadcast that must not be forwarded (RFC 919).  For\n   IPv6, the All Nodes\
    \ link-local multicast destination\n   FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 MUST be used, defined\

- title: 6.  Reception
  contents:
  - "6.  Reception\n   Upon receipt, the datagram should be optically scanned into\
    \ an\n   electronically transmittable form, similar to the methods used in RFC\n\
    \   1149 [9].  If present, any checksums SHOULD be computed and compared\n   with\
    \ supplied values.  If the checksum does not match, the packet\n   MUST be discarded.\n\
    \   Physical layers always have advantages and disadvantages depending on\n  \
    \ their condition, maintenance, prevalence, and economic factors; the\n   atmosphere\
    \ is no different.  The protocols defined herein do not\n   specify a TTL specifically\
    \ because it is often out of their control,\n   and dependent on the conditions\
    \ present.  The intrinsic TTL produces\n   a curve of error rates where, after\
    \ time, meaning cannot be\n   deciphered from the datagram either because of a\
    \ non-matching\n   checksum or, in the absence of a checksum (such as the ADVERT\n\
    \   protocol), because of an unintelligible transmission.  If the Source\n   field\
    \ is sufficiently distinguishable, the recipient MAY contact the\n   sender for\
    \ message clarification.  RFC 919 is in agreement in stating\n   that broadcasts\
    \ MUST NOT be assumed to have been reliably delivered.\n   Reconsidering Figure\
    \ 3, a broadcast HTTP Request is sent, and\n   recipients should return the request\
    \ from each of their computer\n   systems that are listening on the requisite\
    \ port.  It is important to\n   remember the security implications of the systems'\
    \ acceptance of data\n   from unknown senders.  It is the responsibility of each\
    \ organization\n   to utilize host-protection mechanisms and egress filtering\
    \ to avoid\n   exposing their systems to undue risk or exposing internal or NAT-ed\n\
    \   devices.\n   Although it may be easy for an operator to silently discard the\n\
    \   packet, it would be inappropriate for a network operator to\n   unilaterally\
    \ discard data, in the absence of policy.  RFC 1087 [10]\n   classifies an action\
    \ that destroys the integrity of computer-based\n   information as unethical and\
    \ unacceptable; and the Code of Ethics of\n   SAGE, USENIX, and LOPSA recognize\
    \ the important of maintaining\n   integrity, reliability, and availability.\n"
