- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Various extensions and companion specifications to the OAuth\
    \ 2.0\n   Authorization Framework [OAUTH-V2] utilize URIs to identify the\n  \
    \ extension in use or other relevant context.  This document creates\n   and registers\
    \ an IETF URN Sub-namespace, as documented in RFC 3553\n   [RFC3553], for use\
    \ with such specifications.  The new 'oauth' Sub-\n   namespace is urn:ietf:params:oauth,\
    \ and OAuth relevant parameters\n   will be established underneath it.\n"
- title: 2.  Registration Template
  contents:
  - "2.  Registration Template\n   If a registrant wishes to have an OAuth URI registered,\
    \ then a URN of\n   the form urn:ietf:params:oauth:<value> will be requested where\n\
    \   <value> is a suitable representation of the functionality or concept\n   being\
    \ registered.\n   The registration procedure for new entries requires a request\
    \ in the\n   form of the following template and is \"Specification Required\"\
    \ per\n   RFC 5226 [RFC5226].\n   URN:\n      The URI that identifies the registered\
    \ functionality.\n   Common Name:\n      The name by which the functionality being\
    \ registered is generally\n      known.\n   Change Controller:  For Standards\
    \ Track RFCs, state \"IETF\".  For\n      others, give the name of the responsible\
    \ party.  Other details\n      (e.g., postal address, email address, and home\
    \ page URI) may also\n      be included.\n   Specification Document(s):  Reference\
    \ to the document that specifies\n      the URI, preferably including a URI that\
    \ can be used to retrieve a\n      copy of the document.  An indication of the\
    \ relevant sections may\n      also be included but is not required.\n   The registration\
    \ request for the urn:ietf:params:oauth URN Sub-\n   namespace is found in the\
    \ IANA Considerations section of this\n   document (Section 4).\n"
- title: 2.1.  Example Registration Request
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Example Registration Request\n   The following is an example registration\
    \ request for a URI underneath\n   the urn:ietf:params:oauth Sub-namespace.  The\
    \ requested URI\n   represents a new OAuth 2.0 grant type.\n   This is a request\
    \ to IANA to please register the value\n   \"grant-type:example\" in the registry\
    \ urn:ietf:params:oauth\n   established in an IETF URN Sub-namespace for OAuth.\n\
    \   o  URN: urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:example\n   o  Common Name: An Example\
    \ Grant Type for OAuth 2.0\n   o  Change controller: IETF\n   o  Specification\
    \ Document: [the document URI]\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   There are no additional security considerations\
    \ beyond those already\n   inherent to using URNs.  Security considerations for\
    \ URNs in general\n   can be found in RFC 2141 [RFC2141].\n   Any work that is\
    \ related to OAuth would benefit from familiarity with\n   the security considerations\
    \ of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework\n   [OAUTH-V2].\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has created the following:\n   o  The registration\
    \ of a new IANA URN Sub-namespace,\n      urn:ietf:params:oauth:, per RFC 3553\
    \ [RFC3553].  The registration\n      request can be found in Section 4.1 below.\n\
    \   o  A new registry called the \"OAuth URI\" registry for URNs\n      subordinate\
    \ to urn:ietf:params:oauth.  The registry \"OAuth URI\"\n      has been added\
    \ to a new top-level registry called \"OAuth\n      Parameters\" as defined by\
    \ [OAUTH-V2].  Instructions for a\n      registrant to request the registration\
    \ of such a URN are in\n      Section 2.\n"
- title: 4.1.  IETF URN Sub-Namespace Registration urn:ietf:params:oauth
  contents:
  - "4.1.  IETF URN Sub-Namespace Registration urn:ietf:params:oauth\n   Per RFC 3553\
    \ [RFC3553], IANA has registered a new URN Sub-namespace,\n   urn:ietf:params:oauth.\n\
    \   o  Registry name: oauth\n   o  Specification: [this document]\n   o  Repository:\
    \ [The registry created in Section 2.]\n   o  Index value: values subordinate\
    \ to urn:ietf:params:oauth are of\n      the form urn:ietf:params:oauth:<value>\
    \ with <value> as the index\n      value.  It is suggested that <value> include\
    \ both a \"class\" and an\n      \"identifier-within-class\" component, with the\
    \ two components being\n      separated by a colon (\":\"); other compositions\
    \ of the <value> may\n      also be used.\n"
