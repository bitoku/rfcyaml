  - "1.  Introduction\n   With rising energy costs and an increasing awareness of\
    \ the\n   ecological impact of running information technology equipment, Energy\n\
    \   Management (EMAN) functions and interfaces are becoming an additional\n  \
    \ basic requirement for network management systems and devices\n   connected to\
    \ a network.\n   This document defines requirements for standards specifications\
    \ for\n   Energy Management, both monitoring functions and control functions.\n\
    \   Energy Management functions focus mainly on devices and their\n   components\
    \ that receive and provide electrical energy.  Devices such\n   as hosts, routers,\
    \ and middleboxes may have an IP address or may be\n   connected indirectly to\
    \ the Internet via a proxy with an IP address\n   providing a management interface\
    \ for the device, for example, devices\n   in a building infrastructure using\
    \ non-IP protocols and a gateway to\n   the Internet.\n   These requirements are\
    \ concerned with the standards specification\n   process and not the implementation\
    \ of specified standards.  All\n   requirements in this document must be reflected\
    \ by standards\n   specifications to be developed.  However, which of the features\n\
    \   specified by these standards will be mandatory, recommended, or\n   optional\
    \ for compliant implementations is to be defined by Standards\n   Track document(s)\
    \ and not in this document.\n   Section 3 elaborates on a set of general needs\
    \ for Energy Management.\n   Requirements for an Energy Management standard are\
    \ specified in\n   Sections 4 through 8.\n   Sections 4 through 6 contain conventional\
    \ requirements specifying\n   information on entities and control functions.\n\
    \   Sections 7 and 8 contain requirements specific to Energy Management.\n   Due\
    \ to the nature of power supply, some monitoring and control\n   functions are\
    \ not conducted by interacting with the entity of\n   interest but rather with\
    \ other entities, for example, entities\n   upstream in a power distribution tree.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Conventional Requirements for Energy Management
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Conventional Requirements for Energy Management\n   The specification of\
    \ requirements for an Energy Management standard\n   starts with Section 4, which\
    \ addresses the identification of entities\n   and the granularity of reporting\
    \ of energy-related information.  A\n   standard must support the unique identification\
    \ of entities,\n   reporting per entire device, and reporting energy-related information\n\
    \   on individual components of a device or attached devices.\n   Section 5 specifies\
    \ requirements related to the monitoring of\n   entities.  This includes general\
    \ (type, context) information and\n   specific information on Power States, Power\
    \ Inlets, Power Outlets,\n   power, energy, and batteries.  The control of Power\
    \ State and power\n   supply by entities is covered by requirements specified\
    \ in Section 6.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Specific Requirements for Energy Management
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Specific Requirements for Energy Management\n   While the conventional\
    \ requirements summarized above seem to be all\n   that would be needed for Energy\
    \ Management, there are significant\n   differences between Energy Management\
    \ and most well-known network\n   management functions.  The most significant\
    \ difference is the need\n   for some devices to report on other entities.  There\
    \ are three major\n   reasons for this.\n   o  For monitoring a particular entity,\
    \ it is not always sufficient to\n      communicate only with that entity.  When\
    \ the entity has no\n      instrumentation for determining power, it might still\
    \ be possible\n      to obtain power values for the entity via communication with\
    \ other\n      entities in its power distribution tree.  A simple example of this\n\
    \      would be the retrieval of power values from a power meter at the\n    \
    \  power line into the entity.  A Power Distribution Unit (PDU) and a\n      Power\
    \ over Ethernet (PoE) switch are common examples.  Both supply\n      power to\
    \ other entities at sockets or ports, respectively, and are\n      often instrumented\
    \ to measure power per socket or port.\n   o  Similar considerations apply to\
    \ controlling the power supply of an\n      entity that often needs direct or\
    \ indirect communications with\n      another entity upstream in the power distribution\
    \ tree.  Again, a\n      PDU and a PoE switch are common examples, if they have\
    \ the\n      capability to switch power on or off at their sockets or ports,\n\
    \      respectively.\n   o  Energy Management often extends beyond entities with\
    \ IP network\n      interfaces to non-IP building systems accessed via a gateway\n\
    \      (sometimes called an Energy Management System or controller).\n      Requirements\
    \ in this document do not cover the details of these\n      networks and energy\
    \ devices but specify means for opening IP\n      network management towards them.\n\
    \   These specific issues of Energy Management, as well as other issues,\n   are\
    \ covered by requirements specified in Sections 7 and 8.\n   The requirements\
    \ in these sections need a new Energy Management\n   framework that deals with\
    \ the specific nature of Energy Management.\n   The actual standards documents,\
    \ such as MIB module specifications,\n   address conformance by specifying which\
    \ features must, should, or may\n   be implemented by compliant implementations.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The terms specified in the terminology section are capitalized\n\
    \   throughout the document; the exceptions are the well-known terms\n   \"energy\"\
    \ and \"power\".  These terms are generic and are used in\n   generated terms\
    \ such as \"energy-saving\", \"low-power\", etc.\n   Energy\n      Energy is the\
    \ capacity of a system to do work.  As used by\n      electric utilities, it is\
    \ generally a reference to electrical\n      energy and is measured in kilowatt-hours\
    \ (kWh) [IEEE-100].\n   Power\n      Power is the time rate at which energy is\
    \ emitted, transferred, or\n      received; power is usually expressed in watts\
    \ (or in joules per\n      second) [IEEE-100].  (The term \"power\" does not refer\
    \ to the\n      concept of demand, which is an averaged power value.)\n   Power\
    \ Attributes\n      Power Attributes are measurements of electric current, voltage,\n\
    \      phase, and frequencies at a given point in an electrical power\n      system\
    \ (adapted from [IEC.60050]).\n      NOTE: Power Attributes are not intended to\
    \ be \"judgmental\" with\n      respect to a reference or technical value and\
    \ are independent of\n      any usage context.\n   Energy Management\n      Energy\
    \ Management is a set of functions for measuring, modeling,\n      planning, and\
    \ optimizing networks to ensure that the network\n      elements and attached\
    \ devices use energy efficiently and in a\n      manner appropriate to the nature\
    \ of the application and the cost\n      constraints of the organization [ITU-M.3400].\n\
    \   Energy Management System\n      An Energy Management System is a combination\
    \ of hardware and\n      software used to administer a network with the primary\
    \ purpose\n      being Energy Management.\n   Energy Monitoring\n      Energy\
    \ Monitoring is a part of Energy Management that deals with\n      collecting\
    \ or reading information from network elements and\n      attached devices and\
    \ their components to aid in Energy Management.\n   Energy Control\n      Energy\
    \ Control is a part of Energy Management that deals with\n      controlling energy\
    \ supply and Power State of network elements, as\n      well as attached devices\
    \ and their components.\n   Power Interface\n      A Power Interface is an interface\
    \ at which a device is connected\n      to a power transmission medium, at which\
    \ it can in turn receive\n      power, provide power, or both.\n   Power Inlet\n\
    \      A Power Inlet is a Power Interface at which a device can receive\n    \
    \  power from other devices.\n   Power Outlet\n      A Power Outlet is a Power\
    \ Interface at which a device can provide\n      power to other devices.\n   Power\
    \ State\n      A Power State is a condition or mode of a device that broadly\n\
    \      characterizes its capabilities, power consumption, and\n      responsiveness\
    \ to input [IEEE-1621].\n"
- title: 3.  General Considerations Related to Energy Management
  contents:
  - "3.  General Considerations Related to Energy Management\n   The basic objective\
    \ of Energy Management is to operate sets of\n   devices using minimal energy,\
    \ while maintaining a certain level of\n   service.  [EMAN-STATEMENT] presents\
    \ the applicability of the EMAN\n   framework to a variety of scenarios and also\
    \ lists use cases and\n   target devices.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Power States
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Power States\n   Entities can be set to an operational state that results\
    \ in the\n   lowest power level that still meets the service-level performance\n\
    \   objectives.  In principle, there are three basic types of Power\n   States\
    \ for an entity or for a whole system:\n   o  full Power State\n   o  sleep state\
    \ (not functional but immediately available)\n   o  off state (may require significant\
    \ time to become operational)\n   In specific devices, the number of Power States\
    \ and their properties\n   vary considerably.  Simple entities may only have the\
    \ extreme states:\n   full Power State and off state.  Many devices have three\
    \ basic Power\n   States: on, off, and sleep.  However, more finely grained Power\n\
    \   States can be implemented.  Examples are various operational low\n   Power\
    \ States in which a device requires less energy than in the full\n   power \"\
    on\" state, but -- compared to the sleep state -- is still\n   operational with\
    \ reduced performance or functionality.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Saving Energy versus Maintaining Service Level
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Saving Energy versus Maintaining Service Level\n   One of the objectives\
    \ of Energy Management is to reduce energy\n   consumption.  While this objective\
    \ is clear, attaining that goal is\n   often difficult.  In many cases, there\
    \ is no way to reduce power\n   without the consequence of a potential service\
    \ (performance or\n   capacity) degradation.  In this case, a trade-off needs\
    \ to be made\n   between service-level objectives and energy minimization.  In\
    \ other\n   cases, a reduction of power can easily be achieved while still\n \
    \  maintaining sufficient service-level performance, for example, by\n   switching\
    \ entities to lower Power States when higher performance is\n   not needed.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Local versus Network-Wide Energy Management
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Local versus Network-Wide Energy Management\n   Many energy-saving functions\
    \ are executed locally by an entity; it\n   monitors its usage and dynamically\
    \ adapts its power according to the\n   required performance.  It may, for example,\
    \ switch to a sleep state\n   when it is not in use, or outside of scheduled business\
    \ hours.  An\n   Energy Management System may observe an entity's Power State\
    \ and\n   configure its power-saving policies.\n   Energy savings can also be\
    \ achieved with policies implemented by a\n   network management system that controls\
    \ Power States of managed\n   entities.  Information about the power received\
    \ and provided by\n   entities in different Power States may be required in order\
    \ to set\n   such policies.  Often, this information is best acquired through\n\
    \   monitoring.\n   Network-wide and local Energy Management methods both have\
    \ advantages\n   and disadvantages, and it is often desirable to combine them.\n\
    \   Central management is often favorable for setting Power States of a\n   large\
    \ number of entities at the same time, for example, at the\n   beginning and end\
    \ of business hours in a building.  Local management\n   is often preferable for\
    \ power-saving measures based on local\n   observations, such as the high or low\
    \ functional load of an entity.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Energy Monitoring versus Energy Saving
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Energy Monitoring versus Energy Saving\n   Monitoring energy, power, and\
    \ Power States alone does not reduce the\n   energy needed to run an entity. \
    \ In fact, it may even increase it\n   slightly due to monitoring instrumentation\
    \ that needs energy.\n   Reporting measured quantities over the network may also\
    \ increase\n   energy use, though the acquired information may be an essential\
    \ input\n   to control loops that save energy.\n   Monitoring energy and Power\
    \ States can also be required for other\n   purposes, including:\n   o  investigating\
    \ energy-saving potential\n   o  evaluating the effectiveness of energy-saving\
    \ policies and\n      measures\n   o  deriving, implementing, and testing power\
    \ management strategies\n   o  accounting for the total power received and provided\
    \ by an entity,\n      a network, or a service\n   o  predicting an entity's reliability\
    \ based on power usage\n   o  choosing the time of the next maintenance cycle\
    \ for an entity\n"

  contents:
  - "3.5.  Overview of Energy Management Requirements\n   The following basic management\
    \ functions are required:\n   o  monitoring Power States\n   o  monitoring power\
    \ (energy conversion rate)\n   o  monitoring (accumulated) received and provided\
    \ energy\n   o  monitoring Power Attributes\n   o  setting Power States\n   Power\
    \ control is complementary to other energy-saving measures, such\n   as low-power\
    \ electronics, energy-saving protocols, energy-efficient\n   device design (for\
    \ example, low-power modes for components), and\n   energy-efficient network architectures.\
    \  Measurement of received and\n   provided energy can provide useful data for\
    \ developing these\n   technologies.\n"
- title: 4.  Identification of Entities
  contents:
  - "4.  Identification of Entities\n   Entities must be capable of being uniquely\
    \ identified within the\n   context of the management system.  This includes entities\
    \ that are\n   components of managed devices as well as entire devices.\n   Entities\
    \ that report on or control other entities must identify the\n   entities they\
    \ report on or control: see Section 7 or Section 8,\n   respectively, for the\
    \ detailed requirements.\n   An entity may be an entire device or a component\
    \ of it.  Examples of\n   components of interest are a hard drive, a battery,\
    \ or a line card.\n   The ability to control individual components to save energy\
    \ may be\n   required.  For example, server blades can be switched off when the\n\
    \   overall load is low, or line cards at switches may be powered down at\n  \
    \ night.\n   Identifiers for devices and components are already defined in\n \
    \  standard MIB modules, such as the Link Layer Discovery Protocol\n   (LLDP)\
    \ MIB module [IEEE-802.1AB] and the Link Layer Discovery\n   Protocol -- Media\
    \ Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-MED) MIB module\n   [ANSI-TIA-1057] for devices, and\
    \ the Entity MIB module [RFC6933] and\n   the power Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] for\
    \ components of devices.  Energy\n   Management needs a means to link energy-related\
    \ information to such\n   identifiers.\n   Instrumentation for measuring the received\
    \ and provided energy of a\n   device is typically more expensive than instrumentation\
    \ for\n   retrieving its Power State.  Many devices may provide Power State\n\
    \   information for all individual components separately, while reporting\n  \
    \ the received and provided energy only for the entire device.\n"

    \ or an outlet.  Some Power\n   Interfaces change over time from being an inlet\
    \ to being an outlet\n   and vice versa.  However, most Power Interfaces never\
    \ change.\n   Devices have Power Inlets at which they are supplied with electric\n\
    \   power.  Most devices have a single Power Inlet, while some have\n   multiple\
    \ inlets.  Different Power Inlets on a device are often\n   connected to separate\
    \ power distribution trees.  For Energy\n   Monitoring, it is useful to retrieve\
    \ information on the number of\n   inlets of a device, the availability of power\
    \ at inlets, and which\n   inlets are actually in use.\n   Devices can have one\
    \ or more Power Outlets for supplying other\n   devices with electric power.\n\
    \   For identifying and potentially controlling the source of power\n   received\
    \ at an inlet, identifying the Power Outlet of another device\n   at which the\
    \ received power is provided may be required.\n   Analogously, for each outlet,\
    \ it is of interest to identify the Power\n   Inlets that receive the power provided\
    \ at a certain outlet.  Such\n   information is also required for constructing\
    \ the wiring topology of\n   electrical power distribution to devices.\n   Static\
    \ properties of each Power Interface are required information\n   for Energy Management.\
    \  Static properties include the kind of\n   electric current (AC or DC), the\
    \ nominal voltage, the nominal AC\n   frequency, and the number of AC phases.\
    \  Note that the nominal\n   voltage is often not a single value but a voltage\
    \ range, such as, for\n   example, (100V-120V), (100V-240V), (100V-120V,220V-240V).\n"

  contents:
  - "5.7.  Time Series of Measured Values\n   For some network management tasks, obtaining\
    \ time series of measured\n   values from entities, such as power, energy, battery\
    \ charge, etc., is\n   required.\n   In general, time series measurements could\
    \ be obtained in many\n   different ways.  Means should be provided to either\
    \ push such values\n   from the location where they are available to the management\
    \ system\n   or to have them stored locally for a sufficiently long period of\
    \ time\n   such that a management system can retrieve the full time series.\n\
    \   The following issues are to be considered when designing time series\n   measurement\
    \ and reporting functions:\n   1.  Which quantities should be reported?\n   2.\
    \  Which time interval type should be used (total, delta, sliding\n       window)?\n\
    \   3.  Which measurement method should be used (sampled, continuous)?\n   4.\
    \  Which reporting model should be used (push or pull)?\n   The most discussed\
    \ and probably most needed quantity is energy.  But\n   a need for others, such\
    \ as power and battery charge, can be\n   identified as well.\n   There are three\
    \ time interval types under discussion for accumulated\n   quantities such as\
    \ energy.  They can be reported as total values,\n   accumulated between the last\
    \ restart of the measurement and a certain\n   timestamp.  Alternatively, energy\
    \ can be reported as delta values\n   between two consecutive timestamps.  Another\
    \ alternative is reporting\n   values for sliding windows as specified in [IEC.61850-7-4].\n\
    \   For non-accumulative quantities, such as power, different measurement\n  \
    \ methods are considered.  Such quantities can be reported using values\n   sampled\
    \ at certain timestamps or, alternatively, by mean values for\n   these quantities\
    \ averaged between two (consecutive) timestamps or\n   over a sliding window.\n\
    \   Finally, time series can be reported using different reporting\n   models,\
    \ particularly push-based or pull-based.  Push-based reporting\n   can, for example,\
    \ be realized by reporting power or energy values\n   using the IP Flow Information\
    \ Export (IPFIX) protocol [RFC7011]\n   [RFC7012].  The Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3411]\n   is an example of a protocol that can be used for\
    \ realizing pull-based\n   reporting of time series.\n   For reporting time series\
    \ of measured values, the following\n   requirements have been identified.  Further\
    \ decisions concerning\n   issues discussed above need to be made when developing\
    \ concrete\n   Energy Management standards.\n"

  - "7.5.  Content of Reports on Other Entities\n   For entities that report on one\
    \ or more other entities, the standard\n   must provide means for indicating what\
    \ type or types of energy-\n   related information can be reported, and for which\
    \ entities.\n"
- title: 8.  Controlling Other Entities
  contents:
  - "8.  Controlling Other Entities\n   This section specifies requirements for controlling\
    \ Power States and\n   power supply of entities by communicating with other entities\
    \ that\n   have the means for doing that control.\n"
- title: 8.1.  Controlling Power States of Other Entities
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Controlling Power States of Other Entities\n   Some entities have control\
    \ over Power States of other entities.  For\n   example, a gateway to a building\
    \ system may have the means to control\n   the Power State of entities in the\
    \ building that do not have an IP\n   interface.  For this scenario and other\
    \ similar cases, a way to make\n   this control accessible to the Energy Management\
    \ System is needed.\n   In addition, it is required that an entity that has its\
    \ state\n   controlled by other entities has the means to report the list of\n\
    \   these other entities.\n"
- title: 8.1.1.  Control of Power States of Other Entities
  contents:
  - "8.1.1.  Control of Power States of Other Entities\n   The standard must provide\
    \ means for an Energy Management System to\n   send Power State control commands\
    \ to an entity that controls the\n   Power States of entities other than the entity\
    \ to which the command\n   was sent.\n"
- title: 8.1.2.  Identity of Other Power State Controlled Entities
  contents:
  - "8.1.2.  Identity of Other Power State Controlled Entities\n   The standard must\
    \ provide means for reporting the identities of the\n   entities for which the\
    \ reporting entity has the means to control\n   their Power States.  Note that,\
    \ in some situations, a manual\n   configuration might be required to populate\
    \ this information.\n"
- title: 8.1.3.  List of All Power State Controlled Entities
  contents:
  - "8.1.3.  List of All Power State Controlled Entities\n   The standard must provide\

    \ control the Power State.\n"
- title: 8.1.4.  List of All Power State Controllers
  contents:
  - "8.1.4.  List of All Power State Controllers\n   The standard must provide means\
    \ for an entity that receives commands\n   controlling its Power State from other\
    \ entities to report the list of\n   all those entities.\n"
- title: 8.2.  Controlling Power Supply
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Controlling Power Supply\n   Some entities may have control of the power\
    \ supply of other entities,\n   for example, because the other entity is supplied\
    \ via a Power Outlet\n   of the entity.  For this and similar cases, means are\
    \ needed to make\n   this control accessible to the Energy Management System.\
    \  This need\n   is already addressed by the requirement in Section 6.2.\n   In\
    \ addition, it is required that an entity that has its supply\n   controlled by\
    \ other entities has the means to report the list of\n   these other entities.\
    \  This need is already addressed by requirements\n   in Sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.4.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Controlling Power State and power supply of entities\
    \ are considered\n   highly sensitive actions, since they can significantly affect\
    \ the\n   operation of directly and indirectly connected devices.  Therefore,\n\
    \   all control actions addressed in Sections 6 and 8 must be\n   sufficiently\
    \ protected through authentication, authorization, and\n   integrity protection\
    \ mechanisms.\n   Entities that are not sufficiently secure to operate directly\
    \ on the\n   public Internet do exist and can be a significant cause of risk,\
    \ for\n   example, if the remote control functions described in Sections 6 and\n\
    \   8 can be exercised on those devices from anywhere on the Internet.\n   The\
    \ standard needs to provide means for dealing with such cases.  One\n   solution\
    \ is providing means that allow the isolation of such devices,\n   e.g., behind\
    \ a sufficiently secured gateway.  Another solution is to\n   allow compliant\
    \ implementations to disable sensitive functions, or to\n   not implement such\
    \ functions at all.\n   The monitoring of energy-related quantities of an entity\
    \ as addressed\n   in Sections 5 through 8 can be used to derive more information\
    \ than\n   just the received and provided energy; therefore, monitored data\n\
    \   requires protection.  This protection includes authentication and\n   authorization\
    \ of entities requesting access to monitored data as well\n   as confidentiality\
    \ protection during transmission of monitored data.\n   Privacy of stored data\
    \ in an entity must be taken into account.\n   Monitored data may be used as input\
    \ to control, accounting, and other\n   actions, so integrity of transmitted information\
    \ and authentication\n   of the origin may be needed.\n"

  contents:
  - "9.1.  Secure Energy Management\n   The standard must provide privacy, integrity,\
    \ and authentication\n   mechanisms for all actions addressed in Sections 5 through\
    \ 8.  The\n   security mechanisms must meet the security requirements detailed\
    \ in\n   Section 1.4 of [RFC3411].\n"
- title: 9.2.  Isolation of Insufficiently Secure Entities
  contents:
  - "9.2.  Isolation of Insufficiently Secure Entities\n   The standard must provide\
    \ means to allow the isolation of entities\n   that are not sufficiently secure\
    \ to operate on the public Internet,\n   e.g., behind a gateway that implements\
    \ sufficient security that the\n   vulnerable entities are not directly exposed\
    \ to the Internet.\n"
- title: 9.3.  Optional Restriction of Functions
  contents:
  - "9.3.  Optional Restriction of Functions\n   The standard must allow compliant\
    \ implementations to disable\n   sensitive functions, or to not implement such\
    \ functions at all, when\n   operating in environments that are not sufficiently\
    \ secured.  This\n   applies particularly to the control functions described in\
    \ Sections 6\n   and 8.\n"
