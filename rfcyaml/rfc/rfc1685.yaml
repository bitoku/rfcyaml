- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   There is a need for human beings who use X.400 systems to\
    \ be able to\n   write down O/R names in a uniform way.\n   There has been a preexisting\
    \ recommendation on how to write O/R names\n   for human consumption in the RARE\
    \ community. Now that the ISO/ITU has\n   adopted a recommendation on how to do\
    \ this [1], RARE needs to update\n   its recommendation on writing O/R names to\
    \ take this standard into\n   account.\n"
- title: 2. Recommendations on writing O/R names
  contents:
  - "2. Recommendations on writing O/R names\n   RARE recommends that the ISO standard\
    \ be followed when writing O/R\n   names. The ISO/ITU standard contains a number\
    \ of options. RARE makes\n   the following recommendations:\n      -    The \"\
    main\" abbreviations, G, I, S, O, OU1, OU2, P, A and C\n           are used. They\
    \ should be written using UPPER CASE.\n      -    The separation character should\
    \ be semicolon (;).\n      -    The ADMD value \"blank\" is expressed by omitting\
    \ the\n           attribute. No other interpretation of a missing ADMD\n     \
    \      attribute is allowed.\n      -    The recommended sequence is G=;I=;S=;O=;OU1=;OU2=;P=;A=;C=;\n\
    \   This means that the O, OU1 and so on will be in opposite order to the\n  \
    \ fields of an Internet domain name; the reason for choosing the\n   ISO/ITU order\
    \ is that this will be more common among users of X.400\n   services.\n"

    \   Final text for AMENDMENT, 7 February 1993\n   Annex to CCITT Rec. F.401 and\
    \ ISO/IEC 10021-2/Am.1\n   Annex F\n      Representation of O/R addresses for\
    \ human usage (This annex does\n      not form an integral part of this Recommendation|International\n\
    \      Standard)\n   F.1 Purpose\n      An O/R address (specified in clause 18)\
    \ consists of a set of\n      values of attributes taken from the list shown in\
    \ Table F.1. In\n      order to represent visually an address to a human user,\
    \ and to\n      enable the user to enter the address into a user interface, each\n\
    \      attribute value needs to be associated with the correct attribute\n   \
    \   type. Many of the names of the attribute types shown in Table F.1\n      are\
    \ too long for convenient usage on paper or a screen. There is a\n      need for\
    \ a format which allows attributes to be represented\n      concisely, e.g., on\
    \ a business card.\n      This annex specifies how addresses can be expressed\
    \ concisely\n      using labels to represent the attribute types. There are three\n\
    \      categories of attributes: those standard mnemonic attributes which\n  \
    \    are most likely to be found in O/R addresses represented for human\n    \
    \  usage (e.g., on business cards), those used in physical delivery\n      addresses,\
    \ and other specialised attributes (including domain\n      defined attributes).\
    \ In order to provide a format which is as\n      concise as possible, many of\
    \ the labels are single characters.\n      This also makes them less language\
    \ dependent.\n      Clause F.3 specifies the format for the representation of\n\
    \      addresses, and clause F.4 specifies the characteristics necessary\n   \
    \   for user interfaces which are intended to be used in conjunction\n      with\
    \ this format.\n   F.2 Scope\n      A labelled format for the communication of\
    \ O/R addresses to human\n      users is specified. The format consists of a set\
    \ of pairs of\n      labels and attribute-values. The characteristics of a user\n\
    \      interface which are necessary to accept addresses given in this\n     \
    \ format are also specified.\n      In addition a self-explanatory format suitable\
    \ for use where there\n      is more space, e.g., in printed material and in the\
    \ user\n      interface, is specified.\n   F.3 Format\n   F.3.1 General\n    \
    \  The objective of the labelled format is to enable O/R addresses to\n      be\
    \ represented in a format which is concise and which can be\n      accurately\
    \ transcribed by human users. This can be facilitated by\n      careful consideration\
    \ of which attributes and values are used to\n      form an O/R address.\n   \
    \   If the attributes of an O/R address include characters from an\n      extended\
    \ character set, human users who do not normally use the\n      same extended\
    \ character set may have difficulty representing the\n      O/R address or entering\
    \ it into their messaging system. In this\n      situation, an alias of the O/R\
    \ address should be provided which is\n      composed entirely of printable string\
    \ characters.\n   NOTES\n      1.   The policy for structuring O/R addresses needs\
    \ to be\n           carefully considered. Individual O/R addresses should be\n\
    \           allocated within an appropriate division of the address\n        \
    \   space to reduce to an acceptable level the probability that\n           2\
    \ users might expect to have the same O/R address. Use of\n           given name\
    \ or initials is usually sufficient to distinguish\n           between users.\
    \ It may be inappropriate to reflect too much\n           granularity in OUs particularly\
    \ if the organizational\n           structure is subject to frequent change, or\
    \ users move\n           between OUs.\n      2.   There may be a conflict between\
    \ the benefits of using long\n           values for attributes which are self\
    \ explanatory (such as\n           the full name of an organisation) and the benefits\
    \ of\n           shorter values (e.g., to concisely fit on a business card).\n\
    \           One solution to this problem is to provide an alternative\n      \
    \     short attribute value (such as the initials of the\n           organisation)\
    \ as an alias for the long value.\n      3.   If a human user might be uncertain\
    \ about the existence of a\n           space in an attribute value (particularly\
    \ when it is\n           typeset), aliases could be provided with and without\
    \ the\n           space (e.g., \"SNOMAIL400\" as an alias for \"SNOMAIL 400\"\
    \ and\n           \"Mac Donald\" as an alias for MacDonald).\n      4.   If an\
    \ alias is provided for an O/R address, it is desirable\n           that this\
    \ is implemented in such a way that a consistent\n           (preferred) form\
    \ of O/R address is generated for all\n           messages originated by the user.\n\
    \      Where national usage permits a single space value for the ADMD in\n   \
    \   an address, this is represented in the address either by omitting\n      the\
    \ ADMD attribute, or showing the ADMD attribute with no value or\n      the value\
    \ of a space.\n   F.3.2 Labelled format\n   F.3.2.1 Syntax\n      O/R addresses\
    \ in labelled format consist of delimited pairs of\n      labels and values in\
    \ the syntax <label>\"=\"<value>. The labels for\n      each attribute are specified\
    \ in Tables F.1, F.2 and F.3. (The\n      physical delivery attributes in Table\
    \ F.2 are included for\n      completeness.) The label and its value are either\
    \ separated by the\n      character \"=\", or by the space between two columns\
    \ in a table.\n      Labels may be represented in upper or lower case, but the\
    \ use of\n      uppercase is recommended as it is likely to be more visually\n\
    \      distinctive.\n      If label/value pairs appear in sequence on a line,\
    \ they are\n      separated by delimiters. Delimiters may optionally be followed\
    \ by\n      one or more spaces. The delimiter character may be either \";\" or\n\
    \      \"/\", but only one of these can be used in one O/R address. When\n   \
    \   the delimiter is \"/\" the first label is prefixed by \"/\". The use\n   \
    \   of a delimiter at the end of a line is optional. If the value of\n      any\
    \ attribute contains the delimiter character, this is\n      represented by a\
    \ pair of delimiter characters.\n      If an identifier is required to preface\
    \ a labelled address, it is\n      recommended that \"X.400\" is used.\n     \
    \ If an address is entirely composed of attributes contained in\n      Table F.1,\
    \ it is recommended that the sequence of attributes in\n      the address is that\
    \ given in Table F.1. If this sequence is\n      incompatible with normal cultural\
    \ conventions, an alternative\n      sequence may be adopted for representations\
    \ of addresses which are\n      primarily intended for use within that culture.\n\

    \   F.3.2.2 Terminal Type\n      There are currently six terminal types, and if\
    \ international\n      consistency is required the following specific abbreviations\n\
    \      should be used to represent the values for these types: tlx, ttx,\n   \
    \   g3fax, g4fax, ia5 and vtx.\n   F.3.2.3 Domain Defined Attribute\n      The\
    \ label for a DDA consists of \"DDA:\" followed by the DDA type.\n      If an\
    \ address includes more than one DDA of the same type, it is\n      assumed that\
    \ the DDAs are intended to be processed in the sequence\n      in which they are\
    \ represented.\n      EXAMPLE - DDA:RFC-822=fred(a)widget.co.uk; O=gateway; P=abc;\
    \ C=gb\n      If the <type> of a DDA type includes the character \"=\", it is\n\
    \      represented by \"==\".\n   F.3.3 Self-explanatory format\n      The self-explanatory\
    \ format may be used when space is available.\n      It consists of a list of\
    \ the attribute types, either in full or\n      abbreviated. The attribute types\
    \ or abbreviations may be in any\n      language, but each attribute type or abbreviation\
    \ in Table F.1 is\n      followed by the specified label. If English language\
    \ abbreviations\n      are used, they should be those given in Tables F.1, F.2\
    \ and F.3.\n      If an address is entirely composed of attributes contained in\n\
    \      Table F.1, it is recommended that the sequence of attributes in\n     \
    \ the address is that given in Table F.1. If this sequence is\n      incompatible\
    \ with normal cultural conventions, an alternative\n      sequence may be adopted\
    \ for representations of addresses which are\n      primarily intended for use\
    \ within that culture.\n    EXAMPLE 1 - Using attribute types in the Norwegian\

    \           AQ\n   F.4 User interface\n      This clause specifies the characteristics\
    \ of a user interface\n      which are necessary to enable a user to input O/R\
    \ addresses\n      represented in either of the formats specified in clause F.3.\n\
    \      It is necessary for the user interface to be able to accept any\n     \
    \ valid combination of attributes from Tables F.1, F.2 and F.3.\n      If the\
    \ user interface lists the attributes given in Table F.1, it\n      is recommended\
    \ that either the sequence used in Table F.1 should\n      be used, or if this\
    \ sequence is incompatible with normal cultural\n      conventions, the alternative\
    \ sequence adopted within a particular\n      culture.\n      If the user supplies\
    \ a value for the PRMD attribute but omits the\n      ADMD attribute, or omits\
    \ the value for the ADMD attribute, the\n      ADMD value to be used is a single\
    \ space.\n      Where an interface accepts an O/R address as a single string\n\
    \      (e.g., in a command line interface), it is necessary to accept any\n  \
    \    valid labelled format address allowing the user to enter either\n      delimiter.\
    \ The interface should not require the attributes to be\n      specified in any\
    \ particular order. The interface should accept\n      labels in upper or lower\
    \ case.\n      NOTE - For some existing command line interfaces it may be\n  \
    \    necessary to enclose the whole labelled format address in quotes.\n     \
    \ If any other type of interface is provided (e.g., a prompting or\n      form-fill\
    \ interface), it is necessary to provide a means which\n      enables the user\
    \ to easily associate the identity of each\n      attribute with the labels specified\
    \ in Tables F.1, F.2 and F.3.\n   NOTES\n      1.   One way to associate the identity\
    \ of each attribute with the\n           labels is to follow the attribute type\
    \ (or abbreviation) for\n           each attribute with the label in brackets,\
    \ for example:\n           Given name (G)\n           Initials (I)\n         \
    \  Surname (S)\n           Generation Qualifier (Q)\n           Common Name (CN)\n\

    \ (P)\n           Administration Management Domain Name (A)\n           Country\
    \ (C)\n      2.   Many users may have difficulty copying an address presented\n\
    \           as a table (either in labelled or self-explanatory format)\n     \
    \      into a command line interface which uses delimiters.\n      3.   For form-fill\
    \ style interfaces, user performance will be\n           optimised when the interface\
    \ most closely resembles the\n           format of the supplied address with the\
    \ same sequence of\n           attributes using the same attribute types or labels.\n\
    \    Examples of application\n      1.   The Norwegian user of a command line\
    \ interface receives a\n           business card containing the following O/R\
    \ address:\n           G=john; S=smith; O=a bank ltd; P=abl; A=snomail; C=aq\n\
    \           The command line interface enables the user to type in the\n     \
    \      address exactly as presented on the card.\n      2.   The Norwegian user\
    \ of a form fill interface receives the\n           same business card. The form\
    \ on the screen includes the\n           following field names:\n           Fornavn\
    \ (G)\n           Etternavn (S)\n           Organisasjon (O)\n           Privat\
    \ domene (P)\n           Administrasjonsdomene (A)\n           Land (C)\n    \
    \       The user is able to fill in the form by associating the\n           single\
    \ letter labels on the business card with the same\n           labels in brackets\
    \ after the Norwegian names of the\n           attributes on the screen. (For\
    \ form fill input the\n           delimiters are not used.)\n      3.   The English\
    \ speaking user of a command line interface\n           receives a document quoting\
    \ the following O/R address:\n           Fornavn (G)               Per\n     \
    \      Etternavn (S)             Hansen\n           Organisasjon (O)         \
    \ Teledir\n           Organisasjonsenhet (OU1)  Forskning\n           Privat domene\
    \ (P)         Tele\n           Administrasjonsdomene (A) Telemax\n           Land\
    \ (C)                  NO\n           The user knows how to transform the address\
    \ from self-\n           explanatory to labelled format. The user can choose to\
    \ enter\n           the address with either delimiter, e.g.,:\n          g=per;s=hansen;o=teledir;ou1=forskning;p=tele;a=telemax;c=no\n\
    \           or:\n         /g=per/s=hansen/o=teledir/ou1=forskning/p=tele/a=telemax/c=no\n"
