- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Network mobility support is concerned with managing the\
    \ mobility of\n   an entire network.  This arises when a router connecting a network\
    \ to\n   the Internet dynamically changes its point of attachment to the fixed\n\
    \   infrastructure, thereby causing the reachability of the entire\n   network\
    \ to be changed in relation to the fixed Internet topology.\n   Such a network\
    \ is referred to as a mobile network.  Without\n   appropriate mechanisms to support\
    \ network mobility, sessions\n   established between nodes in the mobile network\
    \ and the global\n   Internet cannot be maintained after the mobile router changes\
    \ its\n   point of attachment.  As a result, existing sessions would break and\n\
    \   connectivity to the global Internet would be lost.\n   This document defines\
    \ the specific terminology needed to describe the\n   problem space, the design\
    \ goals [1], and the solutions for network\n   mobility support.  This terminology\
    \ aims to be consistent with the\n   usual IPv6 terminology [2] and the generic\
    \ mobility-related terms\n   already defined in the Mobility Related Terminology\
    \ [3] and in the\n   Mobile IPv6 specification [4].  Some terms introduced in\
    \ this\n   document may only be useful for defining the problem scope and\n  \
    \ functional requirements of network mobility support.\n   Note that the abbreviation\
    \ NEMO stands for either \"a NEtwork that is\n   MObile\" or \"NEtwork MObility\"\
    .  The former (see Section 2.1) is used\n   as a noun, e.g., \"a NEMO\" meaning\
    \ \"a mobile network\".  The latter\n   (see Section 7) refers to the concept\
    \ of \"network mobility\", as in\n   \"NEMO Basic Support\", and is also the working\
    \ group's name.\n   Section 2 introduces terms to define the architecture, while\
    \ terms\n   needed to emphasize the distinct functionalities of those\n   architectural\
    \ components are described in Section 3.  Section 4,\n   Section 5, and Section\
    \ 6 describe terms pertaining to nested\n   mobility, multihoming, and different\
    \ configurations of mobile\n   networks at home, respectively.  The different\
    \ types of mobility are\n   defined in Section 7.  The last section lists miscellaneous\
    \ terms\n   that do not fit into any other section.\n"

  - "2.  Architectural Components\n   A mobile network is composed of one or more\
    \ mobile IP-subnets and is\n   viewed as a single unit.  This network unit is\
    \ connected to the\n   Internet by means of one or more mobile routers (MRs).\
    \  Nodes behind\n   the MR (referred to as MNNs) primarily comprise fixed nodes\
    \ (nodes\n   unable to change their point of attachment while maintaining ongoing\n\
    \   sessions), and possibly mobile nodes (nodes able to change their\n   point\
    \ of attachment while maintaining ongoing sessions).  In most\n   cases, the internal\
    \ structure of the mobile network will be stable\n   (no dynamic change of the\
    \ topology), but this is not always true.\n   Figure 1 illustrates the architectural\
    \ components involved in network\n   mobility and are defined in the following\
    \ paragraphs: Mobile Router\n   (MR), Mobile Network (NEMO), Mobile Network Node\
    \ (MNN), \"ingress\n   interface\", \"egress interface\", and Correspondent Node\
    \ (CN).  The\n   other terms, \"access router\" (AR), \"Fixed Node (FN)\", \"\
    Mobile Node\n   (MN)\", \"home agent\" (HA), \"home link\", and \"foreign link\"\
    , are not\n   terms specific to network mobility and thus are defined in [3].\n\

    \   mobility:\n   o  The attaching node is a single VMN (see Figure 4).  For instance,\n\
    \      when a passenger carrying a mobile phone gets Internet access from\n  \
    \    the public access network deployed on a bus.\n   o  The attaching node is\
    \ an MR with nodes behind it, i.e., a mobile\n      network (see Figure 5).  For\
