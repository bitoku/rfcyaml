Using the OSI Directory to Achieve User Friendly Naming
This proposal sets out some conventions for representing names in a friendly manner, and shows how this can be used to achieve really friendly naming.
This memo describes the state of standardization of protocols used in the Internet as determined by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).
A String Representation of Distinguished Names
The OSI Directory uses distinguished names as the primary keys to entries in the directory.
Distinguished Names are encoded in ASN.1.
When a distinguished name is communicated between to users not using a directory protocol (e.g., in a mail message), there is a need to have a user oriented string representation of distinguished name.
This specification defines a string format for representing names, which is designed to give a clean representation of commonly used names, whilst being able to represent any distinguished name.
The String Representation of Standard Attribute Syntaxes The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) requires that the contents of AttributeValue fields in protocol elements be octet strings.

The protocol described in this document is designed to provide access to the X.500 Directory while not incurring the resource requirements of the Directory Access Protocol (DAP).This protocol is specifically targeted at simple management applications and browser applications that provide simple read/write interactive access to the X.500 Directory, and is intended to be a complement to the DAP itself.

To Be "On" the Internet
The Internet permits different levels of access for consumers and providers of service.
The nature of those differences is quite important in the capabilities They afford.
Hence, it is appropriate to provide terminology that distinguishes among the range, so that the Internet community can gain some clarity when distinguishing whether a user (or an organization) is "on" the Internet.
This document suggests four terms, for distinguishing the major classes of access.
