  - "1.  Introduction\n   OSPF-MDR [RFC5614] specifies an extension of OSPF [RFC2328,\
    \ RFC5340]\n   to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) by specifying its\n\
    \   operation on the new OSPF interface of type MANET.  OSPF-MDR\n   generalizes\
    \ the Designated Router (DR) to a connected dominating set\n   (CDS) consisting\
    \ of a typically small subset of routers called MANET\n   Designated Routers (MDRs).\
    \  Similarly, the Backup Designated Router\n   (BDR) is generalized to a subset\
    \ of routers called Backup MDRs\n   (BMDRs).  MDRs achieve scalability in MANETs\
    \ similar to the way DRs\n   achieve scalability in broadcast networks:\n   o\
    \  MDRs have primary responsibility for flooding the Link State\n      Advertisements\
    \ (LSAs). Backup MDRs provide backup flooding when\n      MDRs temporarily fail.\n\
    \   o  MDRs allow the number of adjacencies to be dramatically reduced by\n  \
    \    requiring adjacencies to be formed only between MDR/BMDR routers\n      and\
    \ their neighbors.\n   In addition, OSPF-MDR has the following features:\n   o\
    \  MDRs and BMDRs are elected based on information obtained from\n      modified\
    \ Hello packets received from neighbors.\n   o  If adjacency reduction is used\
    \ (the default), adjacencies are\n      formed between MDRs so as to form a connected\
    \ subgraph.  An option\n      (AdjConnectivity = 2) allows for additional adjacencies\
    \ to be\n      formed between MDRs/BMDRs to produce a biconnected subgraph.\n\
    \   o  Each non-MDR router becomes adjacent with an MDR called its\n      Parent,\
    \ and optionally (if AdjConnectivity = 2) becomes adjacent\n      with another\
    \ MDR or BMDR called its Backup Parent.\n   o  Each router advertises connections\
    \ to its neighbor routers as\n      point-to-point links in its router-LSA.  Network-LSAs\
    \ are not\n      used.\n   o  In addition to full-topology LSAs, partial-topology\
    \ LSAs may be\n      used to reduce the size of router-LSAs.  Such LSAs are formatted\n\
    \      as standard LSAs, but advertise links to only a subset of\n      neighbors.\n\
    \   o  Optionally, differential Hellos can be used, which reduce overhead\n  \
    \    by reporting only changes in neighbor states.\n   This document describes\
    \ the use of OSPF-MDR in a single-hop broadcast\n   network, which is a special\
    \ case of a MANET in which each router is a\n   (one-hop) neighbor of each other\
    \ router.  An understanding of\n   [RFC5614] is assumed.  Unlike an OSPF broadcast\
    \ interface, such an\n   interface can have a different cost associated with each\
    \ neighbor.\n   An example use case is when the underlying radio system performs\n\
    \   layer-2 routing but has a different number of (layer-2) hops to\n   (layer-3)\
    \ neighbors.\n   The rationale for using this interface type for single-hop broadcast\n\
    \   networks, instead of a broadcast interface type, is to represent the\n   underlying\
    \ network in a point-to-multipoint manner, allowing each\n   router to advertise\
    \ different costs to different neighbors in its\n   router-LSA.  In this sense,\
    \ this document shows how the OSPF-MDR\n   interface type can be configured (and\
    \ simplified if desired) to\n   achieve the same goals as the OSPF Hybrid Broadcast\
    \ and\n   Point-to-Multipoint interface type [RFC6845].\n   Section 2 describes\
    \ the operation of OSPF-MDR in a single-hop\n   broadcast network with recommended\
    \ parameter settings.  Section 3\n   describes an alternative procedure that may\
    \ be used to decide which\n   neighbors on a single-hop broadcast network to advertise\
    \ in the\n   router-LSA.  Section 4 describes a simplified version of the MDR\n\
    \   selection algorithm for single-hop networks.\n   The alternative procedure\
    \ of Section 3 and the simplified algorithm\n   of Section 4 are optional and\
    \ MUST NOT be used if it is possible for\n   two routers in the network to be\
    \ more than one hop from each other.\n"

- title: 2.  Operation in a Single-Hop Broadcast Network
  contents:
  - "2.  Operation in a Single-Hop Broadcast Network\n   When OSPF-MDR is used in\
    \ a single-hop broadcast network, the\n   following parameter settings and options\
    \ (defined in [RFC5614])\n   should be used:\n   o  AdjConnectivity SHOULD be\
    \ equal to 2 (biconnected); this provides\n      the smoothest transition when\
    \ one router replaces another as MDR,\n      since the set of adjacencies forms\
    \ a biconnected network that\n      remains connected during the transition.\n\
    \   o  AdjConnectivity MAY be equal to 1 (uniconnected), resulting in a\n    \
    \  slightly less smooth transition, since adjacencies must be formed\n      between\
    \ the new MDR and all of its neighbors.\n   o  AdjConnectivity SHOULD NOT be equal\
    \ to 0 (full topology), since\n      this requires adjacencies to be formed between\
    \ all pairs of\n      routers, adding unnecessary message overhead.\n   o  An\
    \ adjacency SHOULD be eliminated if neither the router nor the\n      neighbor\
    \ is an MDR or BMDR (see Section 7.3 of [RFC5614]).\n   o  LSAFullness MUST be\
    \ equal to 4 or 5 if full-topology LSAs are\n      required. (The value 5 is defined\
    \ in Section 3 of this document.)\n   o  LSAFullness MAY be equal to 1 (min-cost\
    \ LSAs) if full-topology\n      LSAs are not required.  This option reduces the\
    \ number of\n      advertised links while still providing shortest paths.\n  \
    \ If AdjConnectivity equals 1 or 2 and full-topology LSAs are used,\n   OSPF-MDR\
    \ running on a single-hop broadcast network has the following\n   properties:\n\
    \   o  A single MDR is selected, which becomes adjacent with every other\n   \
    \   router, as in an OSPF broadcast network.\n   o  Two BMDRs are selected.  This\
    \ occurs because the MDR selection\n      algorithm ensures that the MDR/BMDR\
    \ backbone is biconnected.  If\n      AdjConnectivity = 2, every non-MDR/BMDR\
    \ router becomes adjacent\n      with one of the BMDRs in addition to the MDR.\n\
    \   o  When all adjacencies are fully adjacent, the router-LSA for each\n    \
    \  router includes point-to-point (type 1) links to all bidirectional\n      neighbors\
    \ (in state 2-Way or greater).\n"
- title: 3.  Originating Router-LSAs
  contents:
  - "3.  Originating Router-LSAs\n   A router running OSPF-MDR with LSAFullness =\
    \ 4 includes in its\n   router-LSA point-to-point (type 1) links for all fully\
    \ adjacent\n   neighbors, and for all bidirectional neighbors that are routable.\
    \  A\n   neighbor is routable if the SPF calculation has produced a route to\n\
    \   the neighbor and a flexible quality condition is satisfied.\n   This section\
    \ describes an alternative procedure that MAY be used\n   instead of the procedure\
    \ described in Section 6 of [RFC5614], to\n   decide which neighbors on a single-hop\
    \ broadcast network to advertise\n   in the router-LSA.  The alternative procedure\
    \ will correspond to\n   LSAFullness = 5, and is interoperable with the other\
    \ choices for\n   LSAFullness.  This procedure avoids the need to check whether\
    \ a\n   neighbor is routable, and thus avoids having to update the set of\n  \
    \ routable neighbors.\n   If LSAFullness = 5, then the Selected Advertised Neighbor\
    \ Set (SANS)\n   is the same as specified for LSAFullness = 4, and the following\
    \ steps\n   are performed instead of the first paragraph of Section 9.4 in\n \
    \  [RFC5614].\n   (1) The MDR includes in its router-LSA a point-to-point (type\
    \ 1) link\n       for each fully adjacent neighbor.  (Note that the MDR becomes\n\
    \       adjacent with all of its neighbors.)\n   (2) Each non-MDR router includes\
    \ in its router-LSA a point-to-point\n       link for each fully adjacent neighbor,\
    \ and, if the router is\n       fully adjacent with the MDR, for each bidirectional\
    \ neighbor j\n       such that the MDR's router-LSA includes a link to j.\n  \
    \ To provide rationale for the above procedure, let i and j be two\n   non-MDR\
    \ routers.  Since the SPF calculation (Section 16.1 of\n   [RFC2328]) allows router\
    \ i to use router j as a next hop only if\n   router j advertises a link back\
    \ to router i, routers i and j must\n   both advertise a link to each other in\
    \ their router-LSAs before\n   either can use the other as a next hop.  Therefore,\
    \ the above\n   procedure for non-MDR routers (Step 2) implies there must exist\
    \ a\n   path of fully adjacent links between i and j (via the MDR) in both\n \
    \  directions before this can happen.  The above procedure for non-MDR\n   routers\
    \ is similar to one described in Section 4.6 of [RFC6845] for\n   non-DR routers.\n"
- title: 4.  MDR Selection Algorithm
  contents:
  - "4.  MDR Selection Algorithm\n   The MDR selection algorithm of [RFC5614] simplifies\
    \ as follows in\n   single-hop networks.  The resulting algorithm is similar to\
    \ the DR\n   election algorithm of OSPF, but is slightly different (e.g., two\n\
    \   Backup MDRs are selected).  The following simplified algorithm is\n   interoperable\
    \ with the full MDR selection algorithm.\n   Note that lexicographic order is\
    \ used when comparing tuples of the\n   form (RtrPri, MDR Level, RID).  Also note\
    \ that each router will form\n   adjacencies with its Parents and dependent neighbors.\
    \  In the\n   following, the term \"neighbor\" refers to a bidirectional neighbor\
    \ (in\n   state 2-Way or greater).\n   Phase 1: Creating the neighbor connectivity\
    \ matrix is not required.\n   Phase 2: MDR Selection\n   (2.1) The set of Dependent\
    \ Neighbors is initialized to be empty.\n   (2.2) If the router has a larger value\
    \ of (RtrPri, MDR Level, RID)\n         than all of its (bidirectional) neighbors,\
    \ the router selects\n         itself as an MDR; selects its BMDR neighbors as\
    \ Dependent\n         Neighbors if AdjConnectivity = 2; then proceeds to Phase\
    \ 4.\n   (2.3) Otherwise, if the router's MDR Level is currently MDR, then it\n\
    \         is changed to BMDR before executing Phase 3.\n   Phase 3: Backup MDR\
    \ Selection\n   (3.1) Let Rmax be the neighbor with the largest value of (RtrPri,\
    \ MDR\n         Level, RID).\n   (3.2) Determine whether or not there exist two\
    \ neighbors, other than\n         Rmax, with a larger value of (RtrPri, MDR Level,\
    \ RID) than the\n         router itself.\n   (3.3) If there exist two such neighbors,\
    \ then the router sets its MDR\n         Level to MDR Other.\n   (3.4) Else, the\
    \ router sets its MDR Level to BMDR, and if\n         AdjConnectivity = 2, adds\
    \ Rmax and its MDR/BMDR neighbors as\n         Dependent Neighbors.\n   (3.5)\
    \ If steps 3.1 through 3.4 resulted in the MDR Level changing\n         from MDR\
    \ Other to BMDR, then execute Step 2.2 again before\n         proceeding to Phase\
    \ 4.  (This is necessary because running Step\n         2.2 again can cause the\
    \ MDR Level to change to MDR.)\n   Phase 4: Parent Selection\n   Each router selects\
    \ a Parent and (if AdjConnectivity = 2) a Backup\n   Parent for the single-hop\
    \ broadcast network.  The Parent for a\n   non-MDR router will be the MDR.  The\
    \ Backup Parent for an MDR Other,\n   if it exists, will be a BMDR.  Each non-MDR\
    \ router becomes adjacent\n   with its Parent and its Backup Parent, if it exists.\
    \  The Parent\n   selection algorithm is already simple, so a simplified version\
    \ is not\n   given here.\n   The Parent and Backup Parent are analogous to the\
    \ Designated Router\n   and Backup Designated Router interface data items in OSPF.\
    \  As in\n   OSPF, these are advertised in the DR and Backup DR fields of each\n\
    \   Hello sent on the interface.\n"
