- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes remote service discovery in the\
    \ Service\n   Location Protocol (SLP) [RFC2608] via DNS SRV [RFC2782].  We consider\n\
    \   remote service discovery as discovering desired services in given\n   remote\
    \ DNS domains, and local service discovery as discovering\n   desired services\
    \ within the local administrative domain.\n   SLP provides a scalable framework\
    \ for local service discovery and\n   selection.  In SLP, User Agents (UAs) discover\
    \ desired services in\n   the local administrative domain by querying all Service\
    \ Agents (SAs)\n   via multicast or querying a Directory Agent (DA) via unicast.\
    \  To\n   query a DA using unicast, a UA needs to first learn about the DA via\n\
    \   DHCP, static configuration or multicast (listening for DAAdvert\n   multicast\
    \ or issuing DA discovery SrvRqst multicast).\n   DNS SRV provides good support\
    \ for remote service discovery.  However,\n   if multiple servers are discovered\
    \ via DNS SRV for a service, only\n   priority and weight can be used to make\
    \ a selection.  If additional\n   service properties (such as cost, speed and\
    \ service quality) need to\n   be considered in the selection process, DNS SRV\
    \ becomes insufficient.\n   We propose that using SLP and DNS SRV together can\
    \ provide better\n   support for remote service discovery.  First, a UA uses DNS\
    \ SRV to\n   find SLP DAs at a remote DNS domain.  Then, the UA uses SLP to query\n\
    \   one of those DAs to discover desired services.  In this way, we can\n   avoid\
    \ the limitations in using SLP and DNS SRV separately.  On one\n   hand, without\
    \ DNS SRV, an SLP UA needs to depend on static\n   configuration to learn about\
    \ remote DAs because DHCP and multicast DA\n   discovery are not generally applicable\
    \ beyond the local\n   administrative domain.  On the other hand, without SLP,\
    \ DNS SRV has\n   limited support for service selection.\n   In this document,\
    \ we first define the DNS SRV Resource Records (RRs)\n   for SLP DA services,\
    \ which are used to map a given DNS domain to\n   remotely accessible (i.e., accessible\
    \ from the Internet) DAs in that\n   domain.  Then, we discuss various issues\
    \ in using SLP and DNS SRV\n   together for remote service discovery.  Finally,\
    \ we give the steps\n   for discovering services in remote DNS domains.\n"

- title: 2.  The DNS SRV RRs for SLP DA services
  contents:
  - "2.  The DNS SRV RRs for SLP DA services\n   According to RFC 2782 [RFC2782],\
    \ the DNS SRV RRs for SLP DA services\n   are defined as follows:\n   _slpda._Proto.Name\
    \ TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target\n   where \"slpda\" is the symbolic\
    \ name for SLP DA services, the Proto\n   field is either \"tcp\" or \"udp\",\
    \ and the Target field is the domain\n   name of an SLP DA.  Please refer to [RFC2782]\
    \ for detailed\n   explanation of each field in DNS SRV RRs.\n   Next we show\
    \ an example of using DNS SRV RRs to map a given DNS\n   domain to remotely accessible\
    \ DAs in that domain.  To discover\n   remotely accessible DAs in a remote domain\
    \ (say, example.com), a UA\n   makes a DNS query [RFC1034,RFC1035] for QNAME=_slpda._tcp.example.com\n\
    \   (or QNAME=_slpda._udp.example.com), QCLASS=IN, and QTYPE=SRV.  Then\n   the\
    \ UA will receive a list of DNS SRV RRs in a DNS reply, which gives\n   all remotely\
    \ accessible DAs in the domain example.com, such as:\n   ;;                  \
    \           Priority Weight Port Target\n   _slpda._tcp.example.com IN SRV 0 \
    \       0      427  da1.example.com\n   _slpda._tcp.example.com IN SRV 0     \
    \   0      427  da2.example.com\n"
- title: 3.  Remote Service Discovery in SLP via DNS SRV
  contents:
  - "3.  Remote Service Discovery in SLP via DNS SRV\n   SLP DAs can be discovered\
    \ in two ways: (1) using the mechanisms\n   described in RFC 2608, and (2) using\
    \ DNS SRV RRs as described in this\n   document.  The second approach is useful\
    \ for UAs to acquire service\n   information for remote DNS domains.  For example,\
    \ a mobile node\n   visiting a network (without the use of mobile IP) may want\
    \ to obtain\n   information about services in its home network.\n"
- title: 3.1.  The DNS Domain of Interest for Remote Service Discovery
  contents:
  - "3.1.  The DNS Domain of Interest for Remote Service Discovery\n   Using DNS SRV\
    \ RRs to discover SLP DAs requires knowledge of the\n   domain where SLP DAs are\
    \ registered.  For remote service discovery,\n   it is assumed that the DNS domain\
    \ of interest is known via a priori\n   knowledge.  For example, a UA is configured\
    \ with a domain name or the\n   user provides the domain name manually.\n   Note\
    \ that there is no implied \"search order\" of DNS domains in\n   finding remote\
    \ DAs.  For instance, if a UA is looking for remote DAs\n   in the domain foo.bar.example.com,\
    \ it SHOULD only look for\n   _slp._tcp.foo.bar.example.com (or _slp._udp.foo.bar.example.com),\
    \ and\n   MUST NOT fall back to look for _slp._tcp.bar.example.com,\n   _slp._tcp.example.com,\
    \ and so on.\n"
- title: 3.2.  SLP DAs for Remote Service Discovery
  contents:
  - "3.2.  SLP DAs for Remote Service Discovery\n   A UA discovers desired services\
    \ in a given remote DNS domain by\n   unicasting requests to DAs in that domain.\
    \  The UA uses remote DAs\n   according to these prioritized rules: (1) using\
    \ DAs which it has been\n   configured with, and (2) using DAs which it has discovered\
    \ via DNS\n   SRV.\n"
- title: 3.3.  SLP Scopes for Remote Service Discovery
  contents:
  - "3.3.  SLP Scopes for Remote Service Discovery\n   As SLP scopes are intended\
    \ to be used only within one administrative\n   domain, they are likely incomprehensible\
    \ to users outside of the\n   administrative domain.  Thus, any remotely accessible\
    \ service MUST be\n   registered in the \"default\" scope, but it MAY be registered\
    \ in other\n   scopes at the same time.  Similarly, all DAs advertised via DNS\
    \ SRV\n   MUST serve the \"default\" scope, but they MAY serve other scopes at\n\
    \   the same time.  As a result, users wishing to discover services at a\n   remote\
    \ DNS domain SHOULD only search the \"default\" scope.\n"
- title: 4.  Steps for Remote Service Discovery
  contents:
  - "4.  Steps for Remote Service Discovery\n   The steps for a User Agent U to discover\
    \ desired services in a remote\n   DNS domain D are as follows.\n   (1) U makes\
    \ a DNS query for QNAME=_slpda._tcp.D (or\n       QNAME=_slpda._udp.D), QCLASS=IN,\
    \ and QTYPE=SRV.  Then, U gets a\n       list of DNS SRV RRs (referred to as L)\
    \ in a DNS reply, which\n       gives all remotely accessible DAs in D.\n   (2)\
    \ U selects a DA X from L based on the priority and weight\n       information\
    \ per RFC 2782.\n   (3) U queries X in the \"default\" scope to discover desired\
    \ services\n       in D.\n   Note that the services discovered in the above steps\
    \ may not\n   necessarily be remotely accessible.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   To support remote service discovery, a domain\
    \ exposes its service\n   information to the Internet.  Standard SLP authentication\
    \ SHOULD be\n   used to protect valuable service information.  First, there is\
    \ a risk\n   that any SA could advertise any service on a DA accessible from the\n\
    \   Internet.  Such a DA SHOULD reject all registrations and\n   deregistrations\
    \ that cannot be authenticated.  Secondly, to avoid\n   disclosing unintended\
    \ service information to remote users, a DA\n   accessible from the Internet SHOULD\
    \ at least authenticate service\n   queries that are not in the \"default\" scope.\
    \  In addition, the\n   security considerations for DNS SRV [RFC2782] apply to\
    \ this document.\n   Also, the DNS security extensions [RFC 2535] SHOULD be used\
    \ to\n   provide origin authentication and integrity protection for DNS data.\n"
- title: 6.  Applicability Statements
  contents:
  - "6.  Applicability Statements\n   This specification describes remote service\
    \ discovery in SLP via DNS\n   SRV.  It facilitates discovering services at a\
    \ remote DNS domain if\n   the domain name is known via a priori knowledge.  However,\
    \ it does\n   not intend to solve the problem of Internet-wide service discovery.\n\
    \   Users should be aware of two constraints in using DNS SRV to discover\n  \
    \ SLP DAs: (1) they SHOULD only use DNS SRV to discover DAs in the\n   \"default\"\
    \ scope, and (2) an administrator may choose to register only\n   a subset of\
    \ all DAs in the \"default\" scope via DNS SRV.  Thus, to\n   discover local DAs,\
    \ implementations MUST use the standard SLP\n   mechanisms per RFC 2608.  In addition,\
    \ implementations supporting\n   this specification MAY use DNS SRV to discover\
    \ local DAs in the\n   \"default\" scope.\n   As SLP scopes are not intended to\
    \ be used outside the local\n   administrative domain, all remote service discovery\
    \ in SLP SHOULD be\n   carried only in the \"default\" scope.\n   Note that the\
    \ services discovered via DNS SRV and remote SLP DAs may\n   not necessarily be\
    \ remotely accessible.\n"
