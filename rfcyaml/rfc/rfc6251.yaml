- title: 1.  Introduction and Background
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and Background\n   This document describes how a Kerberos V5\
    \ [RFC4120] implementation\n   may upgrade communication between clients and Key\
    \ Distribution\n   Centers (KDCs) to use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246]\n\
    \   protocol.\n   The TLS protocol offers integrity- and privacy-protected exchanges\n\
    \   that can be authenticated using X.509 certificates, OpenPGP keys\n   [RFC6091],\
    \ and usernames and passwords via Secure Remote Password\n   (SRP) [RFC5054].\n\
    \   There are several reasons to use Kerberos V5 over TLS.\n   o  It prevents\
    \ downgrade attacks affecting, e.g., encryption types\n      and pre-auth data\
    \ negotiation.  The encryption type field in\n      KDC-REQ and the METHOD-DATA\
    \ field with the requested pre-auth\n      types from the server in KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED\
    \ errors in\n      KDC-REP are sent without integrity or privacy protection in\n\
    \      Kerberos V5.  This allows an active attacker to replace the\n      encryption\
    \ type with a compromised encryption type, e.g., 56-bit\n      DES, or request\
    \ that clients should use a broken pre-auth type.\n      Since clients in general\
    \ cannot know the encryption types other\n      servers support, or the pre-auth\
    \ types servers prefer or require,\n      it is difficult for the client to detect\
    \ if there was a man in the\n      middle or if the remote server simply did not\
    \ support a stronger\n      encryption type or preferred another pre-auth type.\n\
    \   o  Kerberos exchanges are privacy protected.  Parts of many Kerberos\n   \
    \   packets are transferred without privacy protection (i.e.,\n      encryption).\
    \  That part contains information, such as the client\n      principal name, the\
    \ server principal name, the encryption types\n      supported by the client,\
    \ the lifetime of tickets, etc.  Revealing\n      such information is, in some\
    \ threat models, considered a problem.\n   o  It provides additional authentication\
    \ against the KDC.  In some\n      situations, users are equipped with smart cards\
    \ with an RSA\n      authentication key.  In others, users have an OpenPGP client\
    \ on\n      their desktop, with a public OpenPGP key known to the server.\n  \
    \ o  It provides explicit server authentication of the KDC to the\n      client.\
    \  In traditional Kerberos V5, authentication of the KDC is\n      proved as a\
    \ side effect that the KDC knows your encryption key\n      (i.e., your password).\n\
    \   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\"\
    ,\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Kerberos V5 STARTTLS Extension
  contents:
  - "2.  Kerberos V5 STARTTLS Extension\n   The STARTTLS extension uses the Kerberos\
    \ V5 TCP extension mechanism\n   [RFC5021].  The extension uses bit 0 in the extension\
    \ bitmask.\n   The protocol is as follows.  The client requests the extension\
    \ by\n   setting the STARTTLS bit in the TCP extension mechanism bitmask.\n  \
    \ (How to deal with extension negotiation failures at this point is\n   described\
    \ in [RFC5021].)  After the server has sent the 4-octet value\n   0x00000000 to\
    \ indicate support of this extension, the stream will be\n   controlled by the\
    \ TLS protocol and its framing.  The TLS protocol is\n   initiated by the client.\n\
    \   Typically, the client initiates the TLS handshake protocol by sending\n  \
    \ a client hello, the server responds, and the handshake continues\n   until it\
    \ either succeeds or fails.\n   If, for any reason, the handshake fails, the STARTTLS\
    \ protocol will\n   also fail, and the TLS error is used as the error indication.\
    \  In\n   this case, no further messages can be exchanged over the same TCP\n\
    \   session.\n   If the handshake succeeds, the Kerberos V5 authentication protocol\
    \ is\n   performed within the protected TLS channel, like a normal TCP\n   Kerberos\
    \ V5 exchange.  In particular, this means that every Kerberos\n   V5 packet will\
    \ be prefixed by a 4-octet length field that indicates\n   the length of the Kerberos\
    \ V5 packet.\n   When no further Kerberos V5 messages need to be transferred in\
    \ the\n   TLS session, the TLS session MUST be shut down properly using the\n\
    \   close_notify alert.  When the TLS session is shut down, the TCP\n   connection\
    \ cannot be re-used to send any further data and MUST be\n   closed.\n"

- title: 5.  Server Certificates
  contents:
  - "5.  Server Certificates\n   The TLS protocol may be used in a mode that provides\
    \ server\n   authentication using, for example, X.509 and OpenPGP.\n   A goal\
    \ for the protocol described in this memo is that it should be\n   as easy to\
    \ implement and deploy on clients as support for UDP/TCP.\n   Since many client\
    \ environments do not have access to long-term\n   storage, or to long-term storage\
    \ that is sufficiently secure to\n   enable validation of server certificates,\
    \ the Kerberos V5 STARTTLS\n   protocol does not require clients to verify server\
    \ certificates.  If\n   server certification had been required, then environments\
    \ with\n   constrained clients such as those mentioned would be forced to\n  \
    \ disable TLS; this would arguably be worse than TLS without server\n   certificate\
    \ validation, as the use of TLS, even without server\n   certificate validation,\
    \ protects against some attacks that Kerberos\n   V5 over UDP/TCP does not.  For\
    \ example, even without server\n   certificate validation, TLS does protect against\
    \ passive network\n   sniffing aimed at tracking Kerberos service usage by a given\
    \ client.\n   However, note that the use of TLS without server certificate\n \
    \  verification opens up a range of active attacks such as man in the\n   middle.\n\
    \   When clients have the ability, they MUST validate the server\n   certificate.\
    \  For this reason, if a KDC presents an X.509 server\n   certificate over TLS,\
    \ it MUST contain an otherName Subject\n   Alternative Name (SAN) identified using\
    \ a type-id of\n   id-krb5starttls-san.  The intention is to bind the server certificate\n\
    \   to the Kerberos realm for the purpose of using Kerberos V5 STARTTLS.\n   The\
    \ value field of the otherName should contain the realm as the\n   \"Realm\" ASN.1\
    \ type.\n          id-krb5starttls-san OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=\n            { iso(1)\
    \ identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)\n              private(4) enterprise(1)\
    \ gnu(11591)\n              shishi(6) krb5starttls-san(1) }\n   To validate a\
    \ server certificate, the client MAY use local\n   configuration (e.g., a list\
    \ that maps the Kerberos realm to a copy of\n   the server's certificate) and\
    \ compare that with the authentication\n   information provided from the server\
    \ via TLS.  For illustration, the\n   server certificate could be an X.509 certificate\
    \ or an OpenPGP key.\n   In this mode, the client needs no processing related\
    \ to id-\n   krb5starttls-san.\n   When the server presents an X.509 server certificate,\
    \ clients MAY use\n   \"Certification Path Validation\" as described in [RFC5280]\
    \ to validate\n   the KDC server certificate.  In addition, unless the client\
    \ can\n   otherwise verify that the server certificate is bound to the KDC of\n\
    \   the target realm, the client MUST verify that the server certificate\n   contains\
    \ the id-krb5starttls-san SAN and that the value is identical\n   to the intended\
    \ Kerberos realm.\n"
