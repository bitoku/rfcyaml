  - "1.  Introduction\n   Segment Routing (SR) allows a flexible definition of end-to-end
    paths\n   within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological\n
    \  subpaths called \"segments\".  These segments are advertised by the\n   link-state
    routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF).  Prefix segments\n   represent an ECMP-aware
    shortest path to a prefix (or a node), as per\n   the state of the IGP topology.
    \ Adjacency segments represent a hop\n   over a specific adjacency between two
    nodes in the IGP.  A prefix\n   segment is typically a multi-hop path while an
    adjacency segment, in\n   most cases, is a one-hop path.  SR's control plane can
    be applied to\n   both IPv6 and MPLS data planes, and it does not require any\n
    \  additional signaling (other than IGP extensions).  The IPv6 data\n   plane
    is out of the scope of this specification; it is not applicable\n   to OSPFv2,
    which only supports the IPv4 address family.  When used in\n   MPLS networks,
    SR paths do not require any LDP or RSVP-TE signaling.\n   However, SR can interoperate
    in the presence of LSPs established with\n   RSVP or LDP.\n   There are additional
    segment types, e.g., Binding Segment Identifier\n   (SID) defined in [RFC8402].\n
    \  This document describes the OSPF extensions required for Segment\n   Routing.\n
    \  Segment Routing architecture is described in [RFC8402].\n   Segment Routing
    use cases are described in [RFC7855].\n"

    router capabilities to be\n   advertised to other routers in the area.\n   These
    SR capabilities are advertised in the Router Information Opaque\n   LSA (defined
    in [RFC7770]).  The TLVs defined below are applicable to\n   both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3;
    see also [RFC8666].\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  SR-Algorithm TLV\n   The SR-Algorithm TLV is a top-level TLV of the Router
      Information\n   Opaque LSA (defined in [RFC7770]).\n   The SR-Algorithm TLV
      is optional.  It SHOULD only be advertised once\n   in the Router Information
      Opaque LSA.  If the SR-Algorithm TLV is not\n   advertised by the node, such
      a node is considered as not being\n   Segment Routing capable.\n   An SR Router
      can use various algorithms when calculating reachability\n   to OSPF routers
      or prefixes in an OSPF area.  Examples of these\n   algorithms are metric-based
      Shortest Path First (SPF), various\n   flavors of Constrained SPF, etc.  The
      SR-Algorithm TLV allows a\n   router to advertise the algorithms currently used
      by the router to\n   other routers in an OSPF area.  The SR-Algorithm TLV has
      the\n   following format:\n    0                   1                   2                   3\n

      \     Algorithm:  Single octet identifying the algorithm.  The following\n         values
      are defined by this document:\n         0:    Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm
      based on link metric.\n               This is the standard shortest path algorithm
      as computed\n               by the OSPF protocol.  Consistent with the deployed\n
      \              practice for link-state protocols, Algorithm 0 permits\n               any
      node to overwrite the SPF path with a different path\n               based on
      its local policy.  If the SR-Algorithm TLV is\n               advertised, Algorithm
      0 MUST be included.\n         1:    Strict Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm
      based on link\n               metric.  The algorithm is identical to Algorithm
      0, but\n               Algorithm 1 requires that all nodes along the path will\n
      \              honor the SPF routing decision.  Local policy at the node\n               claiming
      support for Algorithm 1 MUST NOT alter the SPF\n               paths computed
      by Algorithm 1.\n   When multiple SR-Algorithm TLVs are received from a given
      router, the\n   receiver MUST use the first occurrence of the TLV in the Router\n
      \  Information Opaque LSA.  If the SR-Algorithm TLV appears in multiple\n   Router
      Information Opaque LSAs that have different flooding scopes,\n   the SR-Algorithm
      TLV in the Router Information Opaque LSA with the\n   area-scoped flooding scope
      MUST be used.  If the SR-Algorithm TLV\n   appears in multiple Router Information
      Opaque LSAs that have the same\n   flooding scope, the SR-Algorithm TLV in the
      Router Information (RI)\n   Opaque LSA with the numerically smallest Instance
      ID MUST be used and\n   subsequent instances of the SR-Algorithm TLV MUST be
      ignored.\n   The RI LSA can be advertised at any of the defined opaque flooding\n
      \  scopes (link, area, or Autonomous System (AS)).  For the purpose of\n   SR-Algorithm
      TLV advertisement, area-scoped flooding is REQUIRED.\n"

      \ The SID/Label advertised in the SID/Label\n   Sub-TLV represents the first

      the order in which the set of SID/\n      Label Range TLVs are advertised inside

      the order is the\n      same after a graceful restart (using checkpointing,

      \  ranges.\n   The originating router advertises the following ranges:\n         Range
      1: Range Size: 100   SID/Label Sub-TLV: 100\n         Range 1: Range Size: 100
      \  SID/Label Sub-TLV: 1000\n         Range 1: Range Size: 100   SID/Label Sub-TLV:
      500\n   The receiving routers concatenate the ranges and build the Segment\n
      \  Routing Global Block (SRGB) as follows:\n      SRGB = [100, 199]\n             [1000,

    SIDs for\n   multiple prefixes from a contiguous address range.\n   The OSPF Extended
    Prefix Range TLV, which is a top-level TLV of the\n   Extended Prefix LSA described

    the set of advertisements\n                  for the same Prefix Range:\n                     An
    ABR always prefers intra-area Prefix Range\n                     advertisements
    over inter-area advertisements.\n                     An ABR does not consider

    the offset in the\n            SID/Label space advertised by this router.\n            V-Flag
    is set to 1 and L-Flag is set to 1: The SID/Index/\n            Label field is
    a 3-octet local label where the 20 rightmost\n            bits are used for encoding
    the label value.\n            All other combinations of V-Flag and L-Flag are
    invalid and\n            any SID Advertisement received with an invalid setting
    for\n            V- and L-Flags MUST be ignored.\n   If an OSPF router advertises
    multiple Prefix-SIDs for the same\n   prefix, topology, and algorithm, all of
    them MUST be ignored.\n   When calculating the outgoing label for the prefix,
    the router MUST\n   take into account, as described below, the E-, NP-, and M-Flags\n
    \  advertised by the next-hop router if that router advertised the SID\n   for
    the prefix.  This MUST be done regardless of whether the next-hop\n   router contributes
    to the best path to the prefix.\n   The NP-Flag (No-PHP) MUST be set and the E-Flag
    MUST be clear for\n   Prefix-SIDs allocated to inter-area prefixes that are originated
    by\n   the ABR based on intra-area or inter-area reachability between areas\n
    \  unless the advertised prefix is directly attached to the ABR.\n   The NP-Flag
    (No-PHP) MUST be set and the E-Flag MUST be clear for\n   Prefix-SIDs allocated
    to redistributed prefixes, unless the\n   redistributed prefix is directly attached
    to the Autonomous System\n   Boundary Router (ASBR).\n   If the NP-Flag is not
    set, then:\n      Any upstream neighbor of the Prefix-SID originator MUST pop
    the\n      Prefix-SID.  This is equivalent to the penultimate hop-popping\n      mechanism
    used in the MPLS data plane.\n      The received E-Flag is ignored.\n   If the
    NP-Flag is set and the E-Flag is not set, then:\n      Any upstream neighbor of
    the Prefix-SID originator MUST keep the\n      Prefix-SID on top of the stack.
    \ This is useful when the\n      originator of the Prefix-SID needs to stitch
    the incoming packet\n      into a continuing MPLS LSP to the final destination.
    \ This could\n      occur at an ABR (prefix propagation from one area to another)
    or\n      at an ASBR (prefix propagation from one domain to another).\n   If both
    the NP-Flag and E-Flag are set, then:\n      Any upstream neighbor of the Prefix-SID
    originator MUST replace\n      the Prefix-SID with an Explicit NULL label.  This
    is useful, e.g.,\n      when the originator of the Prefix-SID is the final destination
    for\n      the related prefix and the originator wishes to receive the packet\n
    \     with the original EXP bits.\n   When the M-Flag is set, the NP-Flag and
    the E-Flag MUST be ignored on\n   reception.\n   As the Mapping Server does not
    specify the originator of a prefix\n   advertisement, it is not possible to determine
    PHP behavior solely\n   based on the Mapping Server Advertisement.  However, PHP
    behavior\n   SHOULD be done in the following cases:\n      The Prefix is intra-area
    type and the downstream neighbor is the\n      originator of the prefix.\n      The
    Prefix is inter-area type and the downstream neighbor is an\n      ABR, which
    is advertising prefix reachability and is also\n      generating the Extended
    Prefix TLV with the A-Flag set for this\n      prefix as described in Section
    2.1 of [RFC7684].\n      The Prefix is external type and the downstream neighbor
    is an\n      ASBR, which is advertising prefix reachability and is also\n      generating
    the Extended Prefix TLV with the A-Flag set for this\n      prefix as described
    in Section 2.1 of [RFC7684].\n   When a Prefix-SID is advertised in an Extended
    Prefix Range TLV, then\n   the value advertised in the Prefix-SID Sub-TLV is interpreted
    as a\n   starting SID/Label value.\n   Example 1: If the following router addresses
    (loopback addresses)\n   need to be mapped into the corresponding Prefix-SID indexes:\n
    \            Router-A: 192.0.2.1/32, Prefix-SID: Index 1\n             Router-B:
    192.0.2.2/32, Prefix-SID: Index 2\n             Router-C: 192.0.2.3/32, Prefix-SID:
    Index 3\n             Router-D: 192.0.2.4/32, Prefix-SID: Index 4\n   then the
    Prefix field in the Extended Prefix Range TLV would be set\n   to 192.0.2.1, Prefix
    Length would be set to 32, Range Size would be\n   set to 4, and the Index value
    in the Prefix-SID Sub-TLV would be set\n   to 1.\n   Example 2: If the following
    prefixes need to be mapped into the\n   corresponding Prefix-SID indexes:\n              192.0.2.0/30,
    Prefix-SID: Index 51\n              192.0.2.4/30, Prefix-SID: Index 52\n              192.0.2.8/30,

    Prefix-SID: Index 57\n   then the Prefix field in the Extended Prefix Range TLV
    would be set\n   to 192.0.2.0, Prefix Length would be set to 30, Range Size would

      5).\n   A Prefix-SID can also be advertised by the SR Mapping Servers (as\n
      \  described in [RFC8661]).  A Mapping Server advertises Prefix-SIDs for\n   remote
      prefixes that exist in the OSPFv2 routing domain.  Multiple\n   Mapping Servers
      can advertise Prefix-SIDs for the same prefix; in\n   which case, the same Prefix-SID
      MUST be advertised by all of them.\n   The flooding scope of the OSPF Extended
      Prefix Opaque LSA that is\n   generated by the SR Mapping Server could be either
      area scoped or AS\n   scoped and is determined based on the configuration of
      the SR Mapping\n   Server.\n   An SR Mapping Server MUST use the OSPF Extended
      Prefix Range TLV when\n   advertising SIDs for prefixes.  Prefixes of different
      route types can\n   be combined in a single OSPF Extended Prefix Range TLV advertised
      by\n   an SR Mapping Server.  Because the OSPF Extended Prefix Range TLV\n   doesn't
      include a Route-Type field, as in the OSPF Extended Prefix\n   TLV, it is possible
      to include adjacent prefixes from different route\n   types in the OSPF Extended
      Prefix Range TLV.\n   Area-scoped OSPF Extended Prefix Range TLVs are propagated
      between\n   areas.  Similar to propagation of prefixes between areas, an ABR
      only\n   propagates the OSPF Extended Prefix Range TLV that it considers to
      be\n   the best from the set it received.  The rules used to pick the best\n
      \  OSPF Extended Prefix Range TLV are described in Section 4.\n   When propagating
      an OSPF Extended Prefix Range TLV between areas,\n   ABRs MUST set the IA-Flag.
      \ This is used to prevent redundant\n   flooding of the OSPF Extended Prefix
      Range TLV between areas as\n   described in Section 4.\n"

    herein, OSPFv2\n   will now program the MPLS data plane [RFC3031] in addition
    to the IP\n   data plane.  Previously, LDP [RFC5036] or another label distribution\n
    \  mechanism was required to advertise MPLS labels and program the MPLS\n   data
    plane.\n   In general, the same types of attacks that can be carried out on the\n
    \  IP control plane can be carried out on the MPLS control plane\n   resulting
    in traffic being misrouted in the respective data planes.\n   However, the latter
    can be more difficult to detect and isolate.\n   Existing security extensions
    as described in [RFC2328] and [RFC7684]\n   apply to these Segment Routing extensions.
    \ While OSPF is under a\n   single administrative domain, there can be deployments
    where\n   potential attackers have access to one or more networks in the OSPF\n
    \  routing domain.  In these deployments, stronger authentication\n   mechanisms
    such as those specified in [RFC7474] SHOULD be used.\n   Implementations MUST
    assure that malformed TLVs and sub-TLVs defined\n   in this document are detected
    and do not provide a vulnerability for\n   attackers to crash the OSPFv2 router
    or routing process.  Reception\n   of malformed TLVs or sub-TLVs SHOULD be counted
    and/or logged for\n   further analysis.  Logging of malformed TLVs and sub-TLVs
    SHOULD be\n   rate limited to prevent a Denial of Service (DoS) attack (distributed\n
    \  or otherwise) from overloading the OSPF control plane.\n"
