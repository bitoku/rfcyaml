  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a set of extensions that instrument RADIUS\n \
    \  accounting server functions.  These extensions represent a portion of\n   the\
    \ Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management\n   protocols\
    \ in the Internet community.  Using these extensions,\n   IP-based management\
    \ stations can manage RADIUS accounting servers.\n   This memo obsoletes RFC 2621\
    \ by deprecating the MIB table containing\n   IPv4-only address formats and defining\
    \ a new table to add support for\n   version-neutral IP address formats.  The\
    \ remaining MIB objects from\n   RFC 2621 are carried forward into this document.\
    \  This memo also adds\n   UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.\n"

- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n   This document uses terminology from RFC 2865 [RFC2865] and\
    \ RFC 2866\n   [RFC2866].\n   This document uses the word \"malformed\" with respect\
    \ to RADIUS\n   packets, particularly in the context of counters of \"malformed\n\
    \   packets\".  While RFC 2866 does not provide an explicit definition of\n  \
    \ \"malformed\", malformed generally means that the implementation has\n   determined\
    \ the packet does not match the format defined in RFC 2866.\n   Those implementations\
    \ are used in deployments today, and thus set the\n   de facto definition of \"\
    malformed\".\n"
- title: 3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
  contents:
  - "3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
- title: 4.  Scope of Changes
  contents:
  - "4.  Scope of Changes\n   This document obsoletes RFC 2621 [RFC2621], RADIUS Accounting\
    \ Server\n   MIB, by deprecating the radiusAccClientTable table and adding a new\n\
    \   table, radiusAccClientExtTable, containing\n   radiusAccClientInetAddressType\
    \ and radiusAccClientInetAddress.  The\n   purpose of these added MIB objects\
    \ is to support version-neutral IP\n   addressing formats.  The existing table\
    \ containing\n   radiusAccClientAddress is deprecated.  The remaining MIB objects\
    \ from\n   RFC 2621 are carried forward into this document.  This memo also adds\n\
    \   UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.\n   RFC 4001 [RFC4001], which\
    \ defines the SMI Textual Conventions for\n   version-neutral IP addresses, contains\
    \ the following recommendation.\n   'In particular, when revising a MIB module\
    \ that contains IPv4\n   specific tables, it is suggested to define new tables\
    \ using the\n   textual conventions defined in this memo [RFC4001] that support\
    \ all\n   versions of IP.  The status of the new tables SHOULD be \"current\"\
    ,\n   whereas the status of the old IP version specific tables SHOULD be\n   changed\
    \ to \"deprecated\".  The other approach, of having multiple\n   similar tables\
    \ for different IP versions, is strongly discouraged.'\n"
- title: 5.  Structure of the MIB Module
  contents:
  - "5.  Structure of the MIB Module\n   The RADIUS accounting protocol, described\
    \ in RFC 2866 [RFC2866],\n   distinguishes between the client function and the\
    \ server function.\n   In RADIUS accounting, clients send Accounting-Requests,\
    \ and servers\n   reply with Accounting-Responses.  Typically, Network Access\
    \ Server\n   (NAS) devices implement the client function, and thus would be\n\
    \   expected to implement the RADIUS accounting client MIB, while RADIUS\n   accounting\
    \ servers implement the server function, and thus would be\n   expected to implement\
    \ the RADIUS accounting server MIB.\n   However, it is possible for a RADIUS accounting\
    \ entity to perform\n   both client and server functions.  For example, a RADIUS\
    \ proxy may\n   act as a server to one or more RADIUS accounting clients, while\n\
    \   simultaneously acting as an accounting client to one or more\n   accounting\
    \ servers.  In such situations, it is expected that RADIUS\n   entities combining\
    \ client and server functionality will support both\n   the client and server\
    \ MIBs.  The server MIB is defined in this\n   document, and the client MIB is\
    \ defined in [RFC4670].\n   This MIB module contains thirteen scalars as well\
    \ as a single table,\n   the RADIUS Accounting Client Table, which contains one\
    \ row for each\n   RADIUS accounting client with which the server shares a secret.\
    \  Each\n   entry in the RADIUS Accounting Client Table includes twelve columns\n\
    \   presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS accounting server.\n   This\
    \ MIB imports from [RFC2578], [RFC2580], [RFC3411], and [RFC4001].\n"
- title: 6.  Deprecated Objects
  contents:
  - "6.  Deprecated Objects\n   The deprecated table in this MIB is carried forward\
    \ from RFC 2621\n   [RFC2621].  There are two conditions under which it MAY be\
    \ desirable\n   for managed entities to continue to support the deprecated table:\n\
    \   1.  The managed entity only supports IPv4 address formats.\n   2.  The managed\
    \ entity supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address formats,\n       and the deprecated\
    \ table is supported for backwards compatibility\n       with older management\
    \ stations.  This option SHOULD only be used\n       when the IP addresses in\
    \ the new table are in IPv4 format and can\n       accurately be represented in\
    \ both the new table and the\n       deprecated table.\n   Managed entities SHOULD\
    \ NOT instantiate row entries in the deprecated\n   table, containing IPv4-only\
    \ address objects, when the RADIUS\n   accounting client address represented in\
    \ such a table row is not an\n   IPv4 address.  Managed entities SHOULD NOT return\
    \ inaccurate values\n   of IP address or SNMP object access errors for IPv4-only\
    \ address\n   objects in otherwise populated tables.  When row entries exist in\n\
    \   both the deprecated IPv4-only table and the new IP-version-neutral\n   table\
    \ that describe the same RADIUS accounting client, the row\n   indexes SHOULD\
    \ be the same for the corresponding rows in each table,\n   to facilitate correlation\
    \ of these related rows by management\n   applications.\n"

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are management objects (radiusAccServConfigReset)\
    \ defined in\n   this MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-\n\
    \   create.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in\n   some\
    \ network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-\n   secure environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative\n   effect on network operations.\
    \  These are:\n   radiusAccServConfigReset\n      This object can be used to reinitialize\
    \ the persistent state of\n      any server.  When set to reset(2), any persistent\
    \ server state\n      (such as a process) is reinitialized as if the server had\
    \ just\n      been started.  Depending on the server implementation details,\n\
    \      this action may or may not interrupt the processing of pending\n      request\
    \ in the server.  Abuse of this object may lead to a Denial\n      of Service\
    \ attack on the server.\n   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB\
    \ that may contain\n   sensitive information.  These are:\n   radiusAccClientIPAddress\n\
    \      This can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS accounting\n  \
    \    client with which the server is communicating.  This information\n      could\
    \ be useful in mounting an attack on the accounting client.\n   radiusAccClientInetAddress\n\
    \      This can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS accounting\n  \
    \    client with which the server is communicating.  This information\n      could\
    \ be useful in mounting an attack on the accounting client.\n   It is thus important\
    \ to control even GET access to these objects and\n   possibly to even encrypt\
    \ the values of these object when sending them\n   over the network via SNMP.\
    \  Not all versions of SNMP provide features\n   for such a secure environment.\n\
    \   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 do not provide a secure environment.\n   Even\
    \ if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   there is no\
    \ control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access and GET/SET\
    \ (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this\n   MIB.\n   It is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that implementers consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3\
    \ framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3\
    \ cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further,\
    \ deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead,\
    \ it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.\
    \  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity\
    \ giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to\
    \ give access to\n   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n\
    \   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
