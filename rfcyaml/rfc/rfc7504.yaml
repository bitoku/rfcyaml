  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines two Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) reply\n
    \  codes, 521 and 556.  The 521 code was originally described in an\n   Experimental
    RFC in 1995 and is in wide use, but has not previously\n   been formally incorporated
    into SMTP.  The 556 code was created to\n   support the new tests and actions
    specified in RFC 7505.  These codes\n   are used to indicate that an Internet
    host does not accept incoming\n   mail at all.  This specification is not applicable
    when the host\n   sometimes accepts mail but may reject particular messages, or
    even\n   all messages, under specific circumstances.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The SMTP specification [2] (referred to, along with its
    various\n   updates, as \"SMTP\" below) contains a list and discussion of reply\n
    \  codes.  This document updates that list with a new code, 521, for use\n   in
    response to an initial connection.  In that context, it\n   specifically denotes
    a system that does not receive mail or otherwise\n   handle SMTP mail or inquiry
    transactions.  That code differs from the\n   use of reply code 554, recommended
    by RFC 5321, because the latter\n   code can be used in a larger variety of situations,
    including mail\n   that is not accepted for, or from, particular sources, destinations,\n
    \  or addresses.  It also introduces a second reply code, 556, for use\n   when
    an SMTP client encounters a domain in a forward-pointing address\n   that it can
    determine (e.g., from the DNS \"null MX\" convention [5])\n   does not support
    receipt of mail and has to report that condition to\n   a host that delivered
    the message to it for further processing.\n   This specification updates RFC 5321
    to add the new codes.  The 521\n   code was first formally proposed in the Experimental
    RFC 1846 [4];\n   this document updates that specification to standardize the
    code and\n   provide more specific treatment of it.\n"

      \  familiarity with the SMTP specification in RFC 5321, particularly its\n   discussion
      of reply codes and their use and theory.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST
      NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",
      \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted

    title: 1.1.  Terminology
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   Many Internet hosts are not in a position -- whether technically,\n
    \  operationally, or administratively -- to offer mail service.  If an\n   SMTP
    client (sender) attempts to open a mail connection to a system\n   that does not
    have an SMTP server, the connection attempt will time\n   out.  SMTP requires
    that timeouts result in the client queuing the\n   message and retrying it for
    an extended period.  That behavior will\n   result in wasted resources and long
    delays in getting an error\n   message back to its originator.\n   One alternative
    is to run a dummy SMTP server on hosts that do not\n   receive mail under any
    circumstances and have that dummy server\n   return a fatal error reply code in
    response to any connection-opening\n   attempt.  Another is to determine, from
    a separate source such as a\n   DNS record, that the host does not receive mail.
    \ This document\n   specifies reply codes to be used for those purposes.\n"
  title: 2.  Background
- contents:
  - "3.  The 521 Reply Code\n   This specification adds the 521 reply code to the
    repertoire\n   specified in SMTP, reserving it for use at connection-opening time
    to\n   indicate that the host does not accept mail under any circumstances.\n
    \  It SHOULD be used for dummy SMTP servers whose sole purpose is to\n   notify
    systems that attempt to open mail connections that the host\n   never accepts
    mail.  It MAY be used in other situations where the\n   intent is to indicate
    that the host never accepts mail.  It SHOULD\n   NOT be used for situations in
    which the server rejects mail from\n   particular hosts or addresses or in which
    mail for a particular\n   destination host is not accepted.  As discussed in SMTP,
    reply code\n   554 is more appropriate for most of those conditions; an additional\n
    \  case, in which the determination that mail is not accepted is\n   determined
    outside the mail system, is covered in the next section\n   (Section 4).\n   \"Server
    does not accept mail\" (or a variant such as \"Host\", \"Domain\",\n   or a related
    term) is an acceptable message to accompany a 521 code\n   used for this purpose.\n
    \  Once the 521 reply code is returned instead of the usual 220, the\n   SMTP
    session proceeds normally.  If the SMTP client attempts to send\n   additional
    commands other than QUIT, the server MAY either continue\n   sending 521 reply
    codes or simply close the connection.  If the\n   purpose of running a dummy SMTP
    server that returns a 521 code is to\n   conserve resources, the latter will usually
    be preferable.\n"
  title: 3.  The 521 Reply Code
- contents:
  - "4.  The 556 Reply Code\n   This specification adds the 556 reply code to the
    repertoire\n   specified in SMTP.  When an intermediate SMTP system (typically
    a\n   relay) that would normally attempt to open a mail connection to a\n   host
    referred to in a forward-pointing address can determine that the\n   host does
    not accept mail connections, and do so without attempting\n   to open a connection
    to that target host, it is appropriate for it to\n   return a reply with a 556
    code to the system that sent it the message\n   for outbound transmission.  Interpretation
    of a special DNS record,\n   found when a lookup is performed in conjunction with
    a RCPT command\n   [5], is one such method (and the only standardized one at the
    time\n   this specification was written).\n   When an SMTP server returns a 556
    reply code after receiving a\n   command (such as RCPT, which contains a forward-pointing
    address)\n   because it has information (such as discussed above) that the mail\n
    \  will not be accepted, the SMTP client is expected to handle the\n   response
    like any other permanent negative completion reply to the\n   command.  This is
    consistent with the SMTP specification.\n"

      message \"Host does not accept\n   mail\", and the 556 code, with message \"Domain
      does not accept mail\",\n   to the function group and numerical lists (Sections
      4.2.2 and 4.2.3,\n   respectively) of RFC 5321.  It also adds the 521 code to
      the\n   \"CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT\" portion of Section 4.3.2 (\"Command-Reply\n
      \  Sequences\"), preceding the 554 code, and the 556 code to the \"RCPT\"\n

    has\n   updated the \"Enumerated Status Codes\" subregistry of the \"Simple Mail\n
    \  Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Enhanced Status Codes Registry\" [3] to\n   include
    these codes, specifically:\n   o  Added 521 to the list of codes associated with
    the enhanced code\n      entry for X.3.2, which now references this document.\n
    \  o  Added this document to the references associated with the enhanced\n      code
    entry for X.1.10 and reply code 556.  Note that, if a use for\n      556 arises
    that is not associated with null MX [5], it may be\n      necessary to add an
    additional enhanced code, but such action is\n      outside the scope of this

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Not running any SMTP server, or running an SMTP
    server that simply\n   emits fixed strings in response to incoming connections,
    should\n   provide significantly fewer opportunities for security problems than\n
    \  running a complete SMTP implementation.  See the Security\n   Considerations
    section of RFC 7505 [5] for a discussion of security\n   issues with that approach.
    \ Use of the specific codes provided here\n   provides more information to the
    client than a generic or arbitrarily\n   chosen 5yz code but should have no other
    effect on security.\n"
