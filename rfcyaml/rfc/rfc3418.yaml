  - "1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of
    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n
    \  It is the purpose of this document to define managed objects which\n   describe
    the behavior of an SNMP entity, as defined in the SNMP\n   architecture STD 62,
    [RFC3411].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119\n
    \  [RFC2119].\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may
    be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The\n
    \  support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n   protection
    can have a negative effect on network operations.\n   SNMPv1 by itself is not
    a secure environment.  Even if the network\n   itself is secure (for example by
    using IPSec), even then, there is no\n   control as to who on the secure network
    is allowed to access and\n   GET/SET (read/change) the objects in this MIB.\n
    \  It is recommended that the implementors consider the security\n   features
    as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use\n   of the User-based
    Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414] and the\n   View-based Access Control
    Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415] is\n   recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user
    responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance
    of this MIB is properly\n   configured to give access to the objects only to those
    principals\n   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change)\n
    \  them.\n"
