  - "1.  Introduction\n   In certain scenarios, a BGP speaker may maintain multiple
    VRFs\n   [RFC4364].  Under certain conditions, it is desirable for a route\n   reflector
    to be able to modify the RT list of a VPN route that the\n   route reflector distributes,
    enabling the route reflector to control\n   how a route originated within one
    VRF is imported into other VRFs.\n   Though it is possible to perform such control
    directly on the\n   originator, it may be operationally cumbersome in an autonomous\n
    \  system with a large number of border routers having complex BGP\n   policies.\n
    \  The technique of the route reflector modifying the RT list works\n   effectively
    as long as the VRF that exports the route is not on the\n   same PE as the VRF(s)
    that imports the route.  However, due to\n   constraints of BGP, it does not work
    if the two are on the same PE.\n   This is because, per the BGP specification
    [RFC4271], a BGP speaker\n   rejects received prefix advertisements that were
    originated by\n   itself.  In an autonomous system with route reflectors, the
    route\n   reflector attaches the ORIGINATOR_ID attribute to the UPDATE messages\n
    \  so that if such prefix advertisements reach the originator, the\n   originator
    can reject them by simply checking the ORIGINATOR_ID\n   attribute.  The BGP specification
    also mandates that a route should\n   not be accepted from a peer when the NEXT_HOP
    attribute matches the\n   receiver's own IP address.\n   This document proposes
    a modification to BGP's behavior by defining a\n   new community [RFC1997] value,
    in order to allow the technique of RT\n   list modification by the route reflector
    to be used in a standard\n   manner throughout an autonomous system, irrespective
    of whether or\n   not the VRFs are on the same or different PEs.\n"

  - "2.  ACCEPT_OWN Community\n   This memo defines ACCEPT_OWN, a new well-known BGP
    community in the\n   First Come First Served [RFC5226] range, whose value as assigned
    by\n   IANA is 0xFFFF0001.  Processing of the ACCEPT_OWN community SHOULD be\n
    \  controlled by configuration.  The functionality SHOULD default to\n   being
    disabled, as further specified in Section 2.3.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Route Acceptance\n   A router MAY accept a route whose ORIGINATOR_ID
      or NEXT_HOP value\n   matches that of the receiving speaker if all of the following
      are\n   true:\n   o  Processing of the ACCEPT_OWN community is enabled by\n
      \     configuration.\n   o  The route in question carries the ACCEPT_OWN community.\n
      \  o  The route in question originated from a source VRF on the router.\n      The
      source VRF is a VRF on the router whose configured Route\n      Distinguisher
      is equal to the Route Distinguisher carried in the\n      route.\n   o  The
      route in question is targeted to one or more destination VRFs\n      on the
      router (as determined by inspecting the Route Target(s)).\n   o  At least one
      destination VRF is different from the source VRF.\n   A route MUST NOT ever
      be accepted back into its source VRF, even if\n   it carries one or more RTs
      that match that VRF.\n"

    - "2.2.  Propagating ACCEPT_OWN between Address Families\n   The ACCEPT_OWN community
      controls propagation of routes that can be\n   associated with a source VRF
      by inspection of their Route\n   Distinguisher and with a target VRF by inspection
      of their Route\n   Target list (for example, VPN routes with a Subsequent Address
      Family\n   Identifier (SAFI) of 128).  As such, it SHOULD NOT be attached to
      any\n   routes that cannot be associated with a source VRF.  This implies\n
      \  that when propagating routes into a VRF, the ACCEPT_OWN community\n   SHOULD
      NOT be propagated.  Likewise, if a route carrying the\n   ACCEPT_OWN community
      is received in an address family that does not\n   allow the source VRF to be
      looked up, the ACCEPT_OWN community MUST\n   be discarded.  An OPTIONAL message
      may be logged in this case.\n"
    title: 2.2.  Propagating ACCEPT_OWN between Address Families
  - contents:
    - "2.3.  Configuration Control\n   ACCEPT_OWN handling SHOULD be controlled by
      configuration, and if\n   controlled by configuration, it MUST default to being
      disabled.  When\n   ACCEPT_OWN is disabled by configuration (either explicitly
      or by\n   default), the router MUST NOT apply the special route acceptance\n
      \  rules detailed in Section 2.1.  The router SHOULD still apply the\n   propagation
      rules detailed in Section 2.2.\n"

  - "3.  Decision Process\n   If a BGP speaker supports ACCEPT_OWN and is configured
    for the\n   extensions defined in this document, the following step is inserted\n
    \  after the LOCAL_PREF comparison step in the BGP decision process:\n      When
    comparing a pair of routes for a BGP destination, the route\n      with the ACCEPT_OWN
    community attached is preferred over the route\n      that does not have the community.\n
    \  In all other respects, the decision process remains unchanged.  This\n   extra
    step MUST only be invoked during the best path selection\n   process of VPN-IP
    routes [RFC4364] (i.e., it MUST NOT be invoked for\n   the best path selection
    of imported IP routes in a VRF).  The purpose\n   of this extra step is to allow
    the paths advertised by the route\n   reflector with ACCEPT_OWN community to be
    selected as best over other\n   paths that the BGP speaker may have received,
    hence enabling the\n   applications ACCEPT_OWN is designed for.\n"
  title: 3.  Decision Process
- contents:
  - "4.  Deployment Considerations\n   The ACCEPT_OWN community as described in this
    document is useful\n   within a single autonomous system that uses a single layer
    of route\n   reflectors.  Its use with hierarchical route reflectors would require\n
    \  further specification and is out of the scope of this document.\n   Likewise,
    its use across multiple autonomous systems is out of the\n   scope of this document.\n"
  title: 4.  Deployment Considerations
- contents:
  - "5.  Other Applications\n   This approach may also be relevant in other scenarios
    where a BGP\n   speaker maintains multiple routing contexts using an approach\n
    \  different from that of [RFC4364], as long as the specific approach in\n   use
    has the property that the BGP speaker originates and receives\n   routes within
    a particular context.  In such a case, \"VRF\" in this\n   document should be
    understood to mean whatever construct provides a\n   routing context in the specific
    technology under consideration.\n   Likewise, \"Route Distinguisher\" should be
    understood to mean whatever\n   construct allows a route's originator to associate
    that route with\n   its source context, and \"Route Target\" should be understood
    to mean\n   whatever construct allows a route to be targeted for import into a\n
    \  context other than its source.\n"
  title: 5.  Other Applications
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   ACCEPT_OWN as described in this document permits
    a router's own route\n   prefix to be advertised to a different VRF on that router.
    \ In this\n   respect, such a route is similar to any other BGP route and shares\n
    \  the same set of security vulnerabilities and concerns.  This\n   extension
    does not change the underlying security issues inherent in\n   BGP VPN [RFC4364].\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Local Extranet Application (Non-normative)\n   One of the applications
    for the BGP well-known community described in\n   this document is auto-configuration
    of extranets within MPLS VPN\n   networks.  Consider the following topology:\n
    \  CE1 --------+\n               |\n              (VRF 1, RD 1, RT 1)\n                       PE1
    ................... RR\n              (VRF 2, RD 2, RT 2)\n               |\n
    \  CE2 --------+\n                      Figure 1: Extranet Application\n   Within
    this topology, PE1 receives a prefix X from CE1.  Prefix X is\n   installed in
    VRF 1 and is advertised to the route reflector (RR) with\n   Route Distinguisher
    (RD) 1 and Route Target (RT) 1 as configured on\n   PE1.  The requirement is to
    import prefix X into VRF 2 and advertise\n   it to CE2 in support of extranet
    VPN connectivity between CE1/VRF1\n   and CE2/VRF2.  Current BGP mechanisms for
    MPLS VPNs [RFC4364] require\n   changing the import RT value and/or import policy
    for VRF 2 on PE1.\n   This is operationally cumbersome in a network with a large
    number of\n   border routers having complex BGP policies.\n   Alternatively, using
    the new ACCEPT_OWN community value, the route\n   reflector can simply re-advertise
    prefix X back to PE1 with RT 2\n   appended.  In this way, PE1 will accept prefix
    X despite its\n   ORIGINATOR_ID or NEXT_HOP value, import it into VRF 2 as a result
    of\n   the presence of RT 2 in the route's Extended Community path\n   attribute,
    and then determine the correct adjacency rewrite within\n   VRF 1 based on the
    RD value and the prefix.  Note that the presence\n   of RT 1 in the route's Extended
    Community path attribute will simply\n   be ignored since RT 1 is associated with
    the source VRF 1.  The same\n   operation also needs to happen in the reverse
    direction (VRF 1\n   learning a route from VRF 2) to achieve establishment of
    an extranet\n   VPN strictly via the route reflector without changing the BGP
    policy\n   of PE1 in any way.\n   A router performing such an extranet application
    can accept a route\n   with its own ORIGINATOR_ID or NEXT_HOP value only if the
    VRF in which\n   the router originated the route is different from the VRF in
    which\n   the router accepts the re-advertised route.\n"
