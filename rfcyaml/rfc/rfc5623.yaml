  - "1.  Introduction\n   A network may comprise multiple layers.  These layers may\
    \ represent\n   separations of technologies (e.g., packet switch capable (PSC),\
    \ time\n   division multiplex (TDM), or lambda switch capable (LSC)) [RFC3945],\n\
    \   separation of data plane switching granularity levels (e.g., PSC-1,\n   PSC-2,\
    \ VC4, or VC12) [RFC5212], or a distinction between client and\n   server networking\
    \ roles.  In this multi-layer network, Label Switched\n   Paths (LSPs) in a lower\
    \ layer are used to carry higher-layer LSPs\n   across the lower-layer network.\
    \  The network topology formed by\n   lower-layer LSPs and advertised as traffic\
    \ engineering links (TE\n   links) in the higher-layer network is called the Virtual\
    \ Network\n   Topology (VNT) [RFC5212].\n   It may be effective to optimize network\
    \ resource utilization\n   globally, i.e., taking into account all layers rather\
    \ than optimizing\n   resource utilization at each layer independently.  This\
    \ allows better\n   network efficiency to be achieved and is what we call inter-layer\n\
    \   traffic engineering.  Inter-layer traffic engineering includes using\n   mechanisms\
    \ that allow the computation of end-to-end paths across\n   layers (known as inter-layer\
    \ path computation) and mechanisms that\n   control and manage the Virtual Network\
    \ Topology (VNT) by setting up\n   and releasing LSPs in the lower layers [RFC5212].\n\
    \   Inter-layer traffic engineering is included in the scope of the Path\n   Computation\
    \ Element (PCE)-based architecture [RFC4655], and PCE can\n   provide a suitable\
    \ mechanism for resolving inter-layer path\n   computation issues.\n   PCE Communication\
    \ Protocol requirements for inter-layer traffic\n   engineering are set out in\
    \ [PCC-PCE].\n   This document describes a framework for applying the PCE-based\n\
    \   architecture to inter-layer traffic engineering.  It provides\n   suggestions\
    \ for the deployment of PCE in support of multi-layer\n   networks.  This document\
    \ also describes network models where PCE\n   performs inter-layer traffic engineering\
    \ as well as describing the\n   relationship between PCE and a functional component\
    \ in charge of the\n   control and management of the VNT, called the Virtual Network\n\
    \   Topology Manager (VNTM).\n"

    \ and Multi-Layer Networks [RFC5212].\n"
- title: 2.  Inter-Layer Path Computation
  contents:
  - "2.  Inter-Layer Path Computation\n   This section describes key topics of inter-layer\
    \ path computation in\n   MPLS and GMPLS networks.\n   [RFC4206] defines a way\
    \ to signal a higher-layer LSP that has an\n   explicit route and includes hops\
    \ traversed by LSPs in lower layers.\n   The computation of end-to-end paths across\
    \ layers is called inter-\n   layer path computation.\n   A Label Switching Router\
    \ (LSR) in the higher layer might not have\n   information on the topology of\
    \ the lower layer, particularly in an\n   overlay or augmented model deployment,\
    \ and hence may not be able to\n   compute an end-to-end path across layers.\n\
    \   PCE-based inter-layer path computation consists of using one or more\n   PCEs\
    \ to compute an end-to-end path across layers.  This could be\n   achieved by\
    \ a single PCE path computation, where the PCE has topology\n   information about\
    \ multiple layers and can directly compute an end-\n   to-end path across layers,\
    \ considering the topology of all of the\n   layers.  Alternatively, the inter-layer\
    \ path computation could be\n   performed as a multiple PCE computation, where\
    \ each member of a set\n   of PCEs has information about the topology of one or\
    \ more layers (but\n   not all layers) and the PCEs collaborate to compute an\
    \ end-to-end\n   path.\n       -----    -----                  -----    -----\n\

    \    -----\n            Figure 1: A Simple Example of a Multi-Layer Network\n\
    \   Consider, for instance, the two-layer network shown in Figure 1,\n   where\
    \ the higher-layer network (LSRs H1, H2, H3, and H4) is a\n   packet-based IP/MPLS\
    \ or GMPLS network, and the lower-layer network\n   (LSRs, H2, L1, L2, and H3)\
    \ is a GMPLS optical network.  An ingress\n   LSR in the higher-layer network\
    \ (H1) tries to set up an LSP to an\n   egress LSR (H4) also in the higher-layer\
    \ network across the lower-\n   layer network, and needs a path in the higher-layer\
    \ network.\n   However, suppose that there is no TE link in the higher-layer network\n\
    \   between the border LSRs located on the boundary between the higher-\n   layer\
    \ and lower-layer networks (H2 and H3).  Suppose also that the\n   ingress LSR\
    \ does not have topology visibility into the lower layer.\n   If a single-layer\
    \ path computation is applied in the higher-layer,\n   the path computation fails\
    \ because of the missing TE link.  On the\n   other hand, inter-layer path computation\
    \ is able to provide a route\n   in the higher-layer (H1-H2-H3-H4) and to suggest\
    \ that a lower-layer\n   LSP be set up between the border LSRs (H2-L1-L2-H3).\n\
    \   Lower-layer LSPs that are advertised as TE links into the higher-\n   layer\
    \ network form a Virtual Network Topology (VNT) that can be used\n   for routing\
    \ higher-layer LSPs.  Inter-layer path computation for end-\n   to-end LSPs in\
    \ the higher-layer network that span the lower-layer\n   network may utilize the\
    \ VNT, and PCE is a candidate for computing the\n   paths of such higher-layer\
    \ LSPs within the higher-layer network.\n   Alternatively, the PCE-based path\
    \ computation model can:\n   - Perform a single computation on behalf of the ingress\
    \ LSR using\n     information gathered from more than one layer.  This mode is\n\
    \     referred to as single PCE computation in [RFC4655].\n   - Compute a path\
    \ on behalf of the ingress LSR through cooperation\n     with PCEs responsible\
    \ for each layer.  This mode is referred to as\n     multiple PCE computation\
    \ with inter-PCE communication in [RFC4655].\n   - Perform separate path computations\
    \ on behalf of the TE-LSP head-\n     end and each transit border LSR that is\
    \ the entry point to a new\n     layer.  This mode is referred to as multiple\
    \ PCE computation\n     (without inter-PCE communication) in [RFC4655].  This\
    \ option\n     utilizes per-layer path computation, which is performed\n     independently\
    \ by successive PCEs.\n   Note that when a network consists of more than two layers\
    \ (e.g., MPLS\n   over SONET over Optical Transport Network (OTN)) and a path\n\
    \   traversing more than two layers needs to be computed, it is possible\n   to\
    \ combine multiple PCE-based path computation models.  For example,\n   the single\
    \ PCE computation model could be used for computing a path\n   across the SONET\
    \ layer and the OTN layer, and the multiple PCE\n   computation with inter-PCE\
    \ communication model could be used for\n   computing a path across the MPLS layer\
    \ (computed by higher-layer PCE)\n   and the SONET layer (computed by lower-layer\
    \ PCE).\n   The PCE invoked by the head-end LSR computes a path that the LSR can\n\
    \   use to signal an MPLS-TE or GMPLS LSP once the path information has\n   been\
    \ converted to an Explicit Route Object (ERO) for use in RSVP-TE\n   signaling.\
    \  There are two options.\n   - Option 1: Mono-Layer Path\n     The PCE computes\
    \ a \"mono-layer\" path, i.e., a path that includes\n     only TE links from the\
    \ same layer.  There are two cases for this\n     option.  In the first case,\
    \ the PCE computes a path that includes\n     already established lower-layer\
    \ LSPs or lower-layer LSPs to be\n     established on demand.  That is, the resulting\
    \ ERO includes\n     subobject(s) corresponding to lower-layer hierarchical LSPs\n\
    \     expressed as the TE link identifiers of the hierarchical LSPs when\n   \
    \  advertised as TE links in the higher-layer network.  The TE link\n     may\
    \ be a regular TE link that is actually established or a virtual\n     TE link\
    \ that is not established yet (see [RFC5212]).  If it is a\n     virtual TE link,\
    \ this triggers a setup attempt for a new lower-\n     layer LSP when signaling\
    \ reaches the head-end of the lower-layer\n     LSP.  Note that the path of a\
    \ virtual TE link is not necessarily\n     known in advance, and this may require\
    \ a further (lower-layer) path\n     computation.\n     The second case is that\
    \ the PCE computes a path that includes a\n     loose hop that spans the lower-layer\
    \ network.  The higher-layer\n     path computation selects which lower-layer\
    \ network to use and the\n     entry and exit points of that lower-layer network,\
    \ but does not\n     select the path across the lower-layer network.  A transit\
    \ LSR that\n     is the entry point to the lower-layer network is expected to\
    \ expand\n     the loose hop (either itself or relying on the services of a PCE).\n\
    \     The path expansion process on the border LSR may result either in\n    \
    \ the selection of an existing lower-layer LSP or in the computation\n     and\
    \ setup of a new lower-layer LSP.\n     Note that even if a PCE computes a path\
    \ with a loose hop expecting\n     that the loose hop will be expanded across\
    \ the lower-layer network,\n     the LSR (that is an entry point to the lower-layer\
    \ network) may\n     simply expand the loose hop in the same layer.  If more strict\n\
    \     control of how the LSR establishes the path is required, mechanisms\n  \
    \   such as Path Key [RFC5520] could be applied.\n   - Option 2: Multi-Layer Path\n\
    \     The PCE computes a \"multi-layer\" path, i.e., a path that includes\n  \
    \   TE links from distinct layers [RFC4206].  Such a path can include\n     the\
    \ complete path of one or more lower-layer LSPs that already\n     exist or that\
    \ are not yet established.  In the latter case, the\n     signaling of the higher-layer\
    \ LSP will trigger the establishment of\n     the lower-layer LSPs.\n"

  - "3.2.  Multiple PCE Inter-Layer Path Computation\n   In this model, there is at\
    \ least one PCE per layer, and each PCE has\n   topology visibility restricted\
    \ to its own layer.  Some providers may\n   want to keep the layer boundaries\
    \ due to factors such as\n   organizational and/or service management issues.\
    \  The choice for\n   multiple PCE computation instead of single PCE computation\
    \ may also\n   be driven by scalability considerations, as in this mode a PCE\
    \ only\n   needs to maintain topology information for one layer (resulting in\
    \ a\n   size reduction for the Traffic Engineering Database (TED)).\n   These\
    \ PCEs are called mono-layer PCEs.  Mono-layer PCEs collaborate\n   to compute\
    \ an end-to-end optimal path across layers.\n   Figure 3 shows multiple PCE inter-layer\
    \ computation with inter-PCE\n   communication.  There is one PCE in each layer.\
    \  The PCEs from each\n   layer collaborate to compute an end-to-end path across\
    \ layers.  PCE\n   Hi is responsible for computations in the higher layer and\
    \ may\n   \"consult\" with PCE Lo to compute paths across the lower layer.  PCE\n\
    \   Lo is responsible for path computation in the lower layer.  A simple\n   example\
    \ of cooperation between the PCEs could be as follows:\n   - LSR H1 sends a request\
    \ to PCE Hi for a path H1-H4.\n   - PCE Hi selects H2 as the entry point to the\
    \ lower layer and H3 as\n     the exit point.\n   - PCE Hi requests a path H2-H3\
    \ from PCE Lo.\n   - PCE Lo returns H2-L1-L2-H3 to PCE Hi.\n   - PCE Hi is now\
    \ able to compute the full path (H1-H2-L1-L2-H3-H4) and\n     return it to H1.\n\
    \   Of course, more complex cooperation may be required if an optimal\n   end-to-end\

    \ to perform inter-\n     layer path computation in the single PCE inter-layer\
    \ path\n     computation model may be less than that of the multiple PCE model\n\
    \     with cooperating mono-layer PCEs, because there is no requirement\n    \
    \ to exchange messages between cooperating PCEs.\n   - When TE topology for all\

    \ path computation model\n     may be adopted because a PCE is able to collect\
    \ all layers' TE\n     topologies by participating in only one routing domain.\n\
    \   - As the single PCE inter-layer path computation model uses more TE\n    \
    \ topology information in one computation than is used by PCEs in the\n     multiple\
    \ PCE path computation model, it requires more computation\n     power and memory.\n\
    \   When there are multiple candidate layer border nodes (we may say that\n  \

    \ Cooperation Model\n   A multi-layer network consists of higher-layer and lower-layer\n\
    \   networks.  LSRs H1, H2, H3, and H4 belong to the higher-layer\n   network,\
    \ and LSRs H2, L1, L2, and H3 belong to the lower-layer\n   network, as shown\
    \ in Figure 5.  The case of single PCE inter-layer\n   path computation is considered\
    \ here to explain the cooperation model\n   between PCE and VNTM, but multiple\
    \ PCE path computation with or\n   without inter-PCE communication can also be\
    \ applied to this model.\n   Consider that H1 requests the PCE to compute an inter-layer\
    \ path\n   between H1 and H4.  There is no TE link in the higher layer between\n\
    \   H2 and H3 before the path computation request, so the request fails.\n   But\
    \ the PCE may provide information to the VNT Manager responsible\n   for the lower-layer\
    \ network that may help resolve the situation for\n   future higher-layer LSP\
    \ setup.\n   The roles of PCE and VNTM are as follows.  PCE performs inter-layer\n\
    \   path computation and is unable to supply a path because there is no\n   TE\
    \ link between H2 and H3.  The computation fails, but PCE suggests\n   to VNTM\
    \ that a lower-layer LSP (H2-H3) could be established to\n   support future LSP\
    \ requests.  Messages from PCE to VNTM contain\n   information about the higher-layer\
    \ demand (from H2 to H3), and may\n   include a suggested path in the lower layer\
    \ (if the PCE has\n   visibility into the lower-layer network).  VNTM uses local\
    \ policy and\n   possibly management/configuration input to determine how to process\n\
    \   the suggestion from PCE, and may request an ingress LSR (e.g., H2) to\n  \
    \ establish a lower-layer LSP.  VNTM or the ingress LSR (H2) may\n   themselves\
    \ use a PCE with visibility into the lower layer to compute\n   the path of this\
    \ new LSP.\n   When the higher-layer PCE fails to compute a path and notifies\
    \ VNTM,\n   it may wait for the lower-layer LSP to be set up and advertised as\
    \ a\n   TE link.  PCE may have a timer.  After TED is updated within a\n   specified\
    \ duration, PCE will know a new TE link.  It could then\n   compute the complete\
    \ end-to-end path for the higher-layer LSP and\n   return the result to the PCC.\
    \  In this case, the PCC may be kept\n   waiting for some time, and it is important\
    \ that the PCC understands\n   this.  It is also important that the PCE and VNTM\
    \ have an agreement\n   that the lower-layer LSP will be set up in a timely manner,\
    \ or that\n   the PCE will be notified by the VNTM that no new LSP will become\n\
    \   available.  In any case, if the PCE decides to wait, it must operate\n   a\
    \ timeout.  An example of such a cooperative procedure between PCE\n   and VNTM\
    \ is as follows, using the example network in Figure 4.\n     Step 1:  H1 (PCC)\
    \ requests PCE to compute a path between H1 and H4.\n     Step 2:  The path computation\
    \ fails because there is no TE link\n              across the lower-layer network.\n\
    \     Step 3:  PCE suggests to VNTM that a new TE link connecting H2 and\n   \
    \           H3 would be useful.  The PCE notifies VNTM that it will be\n     \
    \         waiting for the TE link to be created.  VNTM considers\n           \
    \   whether lower-layer LSPs should be established, if\n              necessary\
    \ and acceptable within VNTM's policy constraints.\n     Step 4:  VNTM requests\
    \ an ingress LSR in the lower-layer network\n              (e.g., H2) to establish\
    \ a lower-layer LSP.  The request\n              message may include a lower-layer\
    \ LSP route obtained from\n              the PCE responsible for the lower-layer\
    \ network.\n     Step 5:  The ingress LSR signals to establish the lower-layer\
    \ LSP.\n     Step 6:  If the lower-layer LSP setup is successful, the ingress\n\
    \              LSR notifies VNTM that the LSP is complete and supplies\n     \
    \         the tunnel information.\n     Step 7:  The ingress LSR (H2) advertises\
    \ the new LSP as a TE link\n              in the higher-layer network routing\
    \ instance.\n     Step 8:  PCE notices the new TE link advertisement and recomputes\n\
    \              the requested path.\n     Step 9:  PCE replies to H1 (PCC) with\
    \ a computed higher-layer LSP\n              route.  The computed path is categorized\
    \ as a mono-layer\n              path that includes the already-established lower-layer\
    \ LSP\n              as a single hop in the higher layer.  The higher-layer\n\
    \              route is specified as H1-H2-H3-H4, where all hops are\n       \
    \       strict.\n     Step 10: H1 initiates signaling with the computed path H2-H3-H4\

    \ Trigger Model\n   Figure 6 shows the higher-layer signaling trigger model. \
    \ The case of\n   single PCE path computation is considered to explain the higher-\n\
    \   layer signaling trigger model here, but multiple PCE path computation\n  \
    \ with/without inter-PCE communication can also be applied to this\n   model.\n\
    \   As in the case described in Section 4.2.1, consider that H1 requests\n   PCE\
    \ to compute a path between H1 and H4.  There is no TE link in the\n   higher\
    \ layer between H2 and H3 before the path computation request.\n   PCE is unable\
    \ to compute a mono-layer path, but may judge that the\n   establishment of a\
    \ lower-layer LSP between H2 and H3 would provide\n   adequate connectivity. \
    \ If the PCE has inter-layer visibility, it may\n   return a path that includes\
    \ hops in the lower layer (H1-H2-L1-L2-H3-\n   H4), but if it has no visibility\
    \ into the lower layer, it may return\n   a path with a loose hop from H2 to H3\
    \ (H1-H2-H3(loose)-H4).  The\n   former is a multi-layer path, and the latter\
    \ a mono-layer path that\n   includes loose hops.\n   In the higher-layer signaling\
    \ trigger model with a multi-layer path,\n   the LSP route supplied by the PCE\
    \ includes the route of a lower-\n   layer LSP that is not yet established.  A\
    \ border LSR that is located\n   at the boundary between the higher-layer and\
    \ lower-layer networks (H2\n   in this example) receives a higher-layer signaling\
    \ message, notices\n   that the next hop is in the lower-layer network, and starts\
    \ to set up\n   the lower-layer LSP as described in [RFC4206].  Note that these\n\
    \   actions depend on a policy being applied at the border LSR.  An\n   example\
    \ procedure of the signaling trigger model with a multi-layer\n   path is as follows.\n\
    \     Step 1:  H1 (PCC) requests PCE to compute a path between H1 and H4.\n  \
    \            The request indicates that inter-layer path computation is\n    \
    \          allowed.\n     Step 2:  As a result of the inter-layer path computation,\
    \ PCE\n              judges that a new lower-layer LSP needs to be established.\n\
    \     Step 3:  PCE replies to H1 (PCC) with a computed multi-layer route\n   \
    \           including higher-layer and lower-layer LSP routes.  The\n        \
    \      route may be specified as H1-H2-L1-L2-H3-H4, where all\n              hops\
    \ are strict.\n     Step 4:  H1 initiates higher-layer signaling using the computed\n\
    \              explicit router of H2-L1-L2-H3-H4.\n     Step 5:  The border LSR\
    \ (H2) that receives the higher-layer\n              signaling message starts\
    \ lower-layer signaling to\n              establish a lower-layer LSP along the\
    \ specified lower-\n              layer route of H2-L1-L2-H3.  That is, the border\
    \ LSR\n              recognizes the hops within the explicit route that apply\n\
    \              to the lower-layer network, verifies with local policy\n      \
    \        that a new LSP is acceptable, and establishes the required\n        \
    \      lower-layer LSP.  Note that it is possible that a suitable\n          \
    \    lower-layer LSP has already been established (or become\n              available)\
    \ between the time that the computation was\n              performed and the moment\
    \ when the higher-layer signaling\n              message reached the border LSR.\
    \  In this case, the border\n              LSR may select such a lower-layer LSP\
    \ without the need to\n              signal a new LSP, provided that the lower-layer\
    \ LSP\n              satisfies the explicit route in the higher-layer signaling\n\
    \              request.\n     Step 6:  After the lower-layer LSP is established,\
    \ the higher-layer\n              signaling continues along the specified higher-layer\
    \ route\n              of H2-H3-H4 using hierarchical signaling [RFC4206].\n \
    \  On the other hand, in the signaling trigger model with a mono-layer\n   path,\
    \ a higher-layer LSP route includes a loose hop to traverse the\n   lower-layer\
    \ network between the two border LSRs.  A border LSR that\n   receives a higher-layer\
    \ signaling message needs to determine a path\n   for a new lower-layer LSP. \
    \ It applies local policy to verify that a\n   new LSP is acceptable and then\
    \ either consults a PCE with\n   responsibility for the lower-layer network or\
    \ computes the path by\n   itself, and initiates signaling to establish the lower-layer\
    \ LSP.\n   Again, it is possible that a suitable lower-layer LSP has already\n\
    \   been established (or become available).  In this case, the border LSR\n  \
    \ may select such a lower-layer LSP without the need to signal a new\n   LSP,\
    \ provided that the existing lower-layer LSP satisfies the\n   explicit route\
    \ in the higher-layer signaling request.  Since the\n   higher-layer signaling\
    \ request used a loose hop without specifying\n   any specifics of the path within\
    \ the lower-layer network, the border\n   LSR has greater freedom to choose a\
    \ lower-layer LSP than in the\n   previous example.\n   The difference between\
    \ procedures of the signaling trigger model with\n   a multi-layer path and a\
    \ mono-layer path is Step 5.  Step 5 of the\n   signaling trigger model with a\
    \ mono-layer path is as follows:\n     Step 5': The border LSR (H2) that receives\
    \ the higher-layer\n              signaling message applies local policy to verify\
    \ that a\n              new LSP is acceptable and then initiates establishment\
    \ of\n              a lower-layer LSP.  It either consults a PCE with\n      \
    \        responsibility for the lower-layer network or computes the\n        \
    \      route by itself to expand the loose hop route in the\n              higher-layer\
    \ path.\n   Finally, note that a virtual TE link may have been advertised into\n\
    \   the higher-layer network.  This causes the PCE to return a path H1-\n   H2-H3-H4,\
    \ where all the hops are strict.  But when the higher-layer\n   signaling message\
    \ reaches the layer border node H2 (that was\n   responsible for advertising the\
    \ virtual TE link), it realizes that\n   the TE link does not exist yet, and signals\
    \ the necessary LSP across\n   the lower-layer network using its own path determination\
    \ (just as for\n   a loose hop in the higher layer) before continuing with the\

    \ several options for the ERO when it reaches the last\n   LSR in the higher layer\
    \ higher-layer network (H2).\n   1. The next subobject is a loose hop to H3 (mono-layer\
    \ ERO).\n   2. The next subobject is a strict hop to L1, followed by a loose hop\n\
    \      to H3.\n   3. The next subobjects are a series of hops (strict or loose)\
    \ in the\n      lower-layer network, followed by H3.  For example, {L1(strict),\n\
    \      L3(loose), L5(loose), H3(strict)}.\n   In the first example, the lower\
    \ layer can utilize any LSP tunnel that\n   will deliver the end-to-end LSP to\
    \ H3.  In the third case, the lower\n   layer must select an LSP tunnel that traverses\
    \ L3 and L5.  However,\n   this does not mean that the lower layer can or should\
    \ use an LSP from\n   L1 to L3 and another from L3 to L5.\n"

    \ Cooperation Model (integrated flavor)\n   Figure 8 shows the NMS-VNTM cooperation\
    \ model (integrated flavor).\n   The case of single PCE path computation is considered\
    \ to explain the\n   NMS-VNTM cooperation model (integrated flavor) here, but\
    \ multiple PCE\n   path computation with inter-PCE communication can also be applied\
    \ to\n   this model.  Note that multiple PCE path computation without inter-\n\
    \   PCE communication does not fit in with this model.  For this model to\n  \
    \ have meaning, the VNTM and NMS are closely coupled.\n   The NMS sends the path\
    \ computation request to the PCE.  The PCE\n   returns the inter-layer path computation\
    \ result.  When the NMS\n   receives the path computation result, the NMS works\
    \ with the VNTM and\n   sends the request to LSR H2 to set up the lower-layer\
    \ LSP.  VNTM uses\n   local policy and possibly management/configuration input\
    \ to determine\n   how to process the computation result from PCE.\n   An example\
    \ procedure of the NMS-VNTM cooperation model (integrated\n   flavor) is as follows.\n\
    \     Step 1:  NMS requests PCE to compute a path between H1 and H4.  The\n  \
    \            request indicates that inter-layer path computation is\n        \
    \      allowed.\n     Step 2:  PCE computes a path.  The result (H1-H2-L1-L2-H3-H4)\
    \ is\n              sent back to the NMS.\n     Step 3:  NMS discovers that a\
    \ lower-layer LSP is needed.  NMS works\n              with VNTM to determine\
    \ whether the new TE LSP H2-L1-L2-H3\n              is permitted according to\
    \ policy, etc.\n     Step 4:  VNTM requests the ingress LSR in the lower-layer\
    \ network\n              (H2) to establish a lower-layer LSP.  The request message\n\
    \              includes the lower-layer LSP route obtained from PCE.\n     Step\
    \ 5:  H2 signals to establish the lower-layer LSP.\n     Step 6:  If the lower-layer\
    \ LSP setup is successful, H2 notifies\n              VNTM that the LSP is complete\
    \ and supplies the tunnel\n              information.\n     Step 7:  H2 advertises\
    \ the new LSP as a TE link in the higher-layer\n              network routing\
    \ instance.\n     Step 8:  VNTM notifies NMS that the underlying lower-layer LSP\
    \ has\n              been set up, and NMS notices the new TE link\n          \
    \    advertisement.\n     Step 9:  NMS requests H1 to set up a higher-layer LSP\
    \ between H1\n              and H4 with the path computed in Step 2.  The lower-layer\n\
    \              links are replaced by the corresponding higher-layer TE\n     \
    \         link.  Hence, the NMS sends the path H1-H2-H3-H4 to H1.\n     Step 10:\
    \ H1 initiates signaling with the path H2-H3-H4 to establish\n              the\
    \ higher-layer LSP.\n   o NMS-VNTM Cooperation Model (separate flavor)\n     \

    \  The\n   NMS manages the higher layer.  The case of multiple PCE computation\n\
    \   without inter-PCE communication is used to explain the NMS-VNTM\n   cooperation\
    \ model here, but single PCE path computation could also be\n   applied to this\
    \ model.  Note that multiple PCE path computation with\n   inter-PCE communication\
    \ does not fit in with this model.\n   The NMS requests a head-end LSR (H1 in\
    \ this example) to set up a\n   higher-layer LSP between head-end and tail-end\
    \ LSRs without\n   specifying any route.  The head-end LSR, which is a PCC, requests\
    \ the\n   higher-layer PCE to compute a path between head-end and tail-end\n \
    \  LSRs.  There is no TE link in the higher-layer between border LSRs\n   (H2\
    \ and H3 in this example).  When the PCE fails to compute a path,\n   it informs\
    \ the PCC (i.e., head-end LSR), which notifies the NMS.  The\n   notification\
    \ may include information about the reason for failure\n   (such as that there\
    \ is no TE link between the border LSRs or that\n   computation constraints cannot\
    \ be met).\n   Note that it is equally valid for the higher-layer PCE to be\n\
    \   consulted by the NMS rather than by the head-end LSR.  In this case,\n   the\
    \ result is the same -- the NMS discovers that an end-to-end LSP\n   cannot be\
    \ provisioned owing to the lack of a TE link between H2 and\n   H3.\n   The NMS\
    \ may now suggest (or request) to the VNTM that a lower-layer\n   LSP between\
    \ the border LSRs be established and be advertised as a TE\n   link in the higher\
    \ layer to support future higher-layer LSP requests.\n   The communication between\
    \ the NMS and the VNTM may be performed in an\n   automatic manner or in a manual\
    \ manner, and is a key interaction\n   between layers that may also be separate\
    \ administrative domains.\n   Thus, this communication is potentially a point\
    \ of application of\n   administrative, billing, and security policy.  The NMS\
    \ may wait for\n   the lower-layer LSP to be set up and advertised as a TE link,\
    \ or it\n   may reject the operator's request for the service that requires the\n\
    \   higher-layer LSP with a suggestion that the operator try again later.\n  \
    \ The VNTM requests the lower-layer PCE to compute a path, and then\n   requests\
    \ H2 to establish a lower-layer LSP.  Alternatively, the VNTM\n   may make a direct\
    \ request to H2 for the LSP, and H2 may consult the\n   lower-layer PCE.  After\
    \ the NMS is informed or notices that the\n   lower-layer LSP has been established,\
    \ it can request the head-end LSR\n   (H1) to set up the higher-layer end-to-end\
    \ LSP between H1 and H4.\n   Thus, cooperation between the higher layer and lower\
    \ layer is\n   performed though communication between NMS and VNTM.  An example\
    \ of\n   such a procedure of the NSM-VNTM cooperation model is as follows,\n \
    \  using the example network in Figure 6.\n     Step 1:  NMS requests a head-end\
    \ LSR (H1) to set up a higher-layer\n              LSP between H1 and H4 without\
    \ specifying any route.\n     Step 2:  H1 (PCC) requests PCE to compute a path\
    \ between H2 and H3.\n     Step 3:  The path computation fails because there is\
    \ no TE link\n              across the lower-layer network.\n     Step 4:  H1\
    \ (PCC) notifies NMS.  The notification may include an\n              indication\
    \ that there is no TE link between H2 and H4.\n     Step 5:  NMS suggests (or\
    \ requests) to VNTM that a new TE link\n              connecting H2 and H3 would\
    \ be useful.  The NMS notifies\n              VNTM that it will be waiting for\
    \ the TE link to be\n              created.  VNTM considers whether lower-layer\
    \ LSPs should\n              be established, if necessary and acceptable within\
    \ VNTM's\n              policy constraints.\n     Step 6:  VNTM requests the lower-layer\
    \ PCE for path computation.\n     Step 7:  VNTM requests the ingress LSR in the\
    \ lower-layer network\n              (H2) to establish a lower-layer LSP.  The\
    \ request message\n              includes a lower-layer LSP route obtained from\
    \ the lower-\n              layer PCE responsible for the lower-layer network.\n\
    \     Step 8:  H2 signals the lower-layer LSP.\n     Step 9:  If the lower-layer\
    \ LSP setup is successful, H2 notifies\n              VNTM that the LSP is complete\
    \ and supplies the tunnel\n              information.\n     Step 10: H2 advertises\
    \ the new LSP as a TE link in the higher-layer\n              network routing\
    \ instance.\n     Step 11: VNTM notifies NMS that the underlying lower-layer LSP\

    \    advertisement.\n     Step 12: NMS again requests H1 to set up a higher-layer\
    \ LSP between\n              H1 and H4.\n     Step 13: H1 requests the higher-layer\
    \ PCE to compute a path and\n              obtains a successful result that includes\

  contents:
  - "5.1.  VNTM Functions\n   VNTM functions are required in both the PCE-VNTM cooperation\
    \ model\n   and the NMS-VNTM model.  In the PCE-VNTM cooperation model,\n   communications\
    \ are required between PCE and VNTM and between VNTM and\n   a border LSR.  Communications\
    \ between a higher-layer PCE and the VNTM\n   are event notifications and may\
    \ use Simple Network Management\n   Protocol (SNMP) notifications from the PCE\
    \ MIB modules [PCE-MIB].\n   Note that communications from the PCE to the VNTM\
    \ do not have any\n   acknowledgements.  VNTM-LSR communication can use existing\
    \ GMPLS-TE\n   MIB modules [RFC4802].\n   In the NMS-VNTM cooperation model, communications\
    \ are required\n   between NMS and VNTM, between VNTM and a lower-layer PCE, and\
    \ between\n   VNTM and a border LSR.  NMS-VNTM communications, which are out of\n\
    \   scope of this document, may use proprietary or standard interfaces,\n   some\
    \ of which, for example, are standardized in TM Forum.\n   Communications between\
    \ VNTM and a lower-layer PCE use the Path\n   Computation Element Communication\
    \ Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440].  VNTM-\n   LSR communications are the same as in\
    \ the PCE-VNTM cooperation model.\n   In the higher-layer signaling trigger model,\
    \ no VNTM functions are\n   required, and no such communications are required.\n\
    \   If VNTM functions are not supported in a multi-layer network, the\n   higher-layer\
    \ signaling trigger model has to be chosen.\n   The inclusion of VNTM functionality\
    \ allows better coordination of\n   cross-network LSP tunnels and application\
    \ of network-wide policy that\n   is far harder to apply in the trigger model\
    \ since it requires the\n   coordination of policy between multiple border LSRs.\n\
    \   Also, VNTM functions could be applied to establish LSPs (or\n   connections)\
    \ in non-MPLS/GMPLS networks, which do not have signaling\n   capabilities, by\
    \ configuring each node along the path from the VNTM.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Border LSR Functions
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Border LSR Functions\n   In the higher-layer signaling trigger model, a\
    \ border LSR must have\n   some additional functions.  It needs to trigger lower-layer\
    \ signaling\n   when a higher-layer Path message suggests that lower-layer LSP\
    \ setup\n   is necessary.  Note that, if virtual TE links are used, the border\n\
    \   LSRs must be capable of triggered signaling.\n   If the ERO in the higher-layer\
    \ Path message uses a mono-layer path or\n   specifies a loose hop, the border\
    \ LSR receiving the Path message must\n   obtain a lower-layer route either by\
    \ consulting a PCE or by using its\n   own computation engine.  If the ERO in\
    \ the higher-layer Path message\n   uses a multi-layer path, the border LSR must\
    \ judge whether lower-\n   layer signaling is needed.\n   In the PCE-VNTM and\
    \ NMS-VNTM cooperation models, no additional\n   function for triggered signaling\
    \ is required in border LSRs except\n   when virtual TE links are used.  Therefore,\
    \ if these additional\n   functions are not supported in border LSRs, where a\
    \ border LSR is\n   controlled by VNTM to set up a lower-layer LSP, the cooperation\
    \ model\n   has to be chosen.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Complete Inter-Layer LSP Setup Time
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Complete Inter-Layer LSP Setup Time\n   The complete inter-layer LSP setup\
    \ time includes inter-layer path\n   computation, signaling, and the communication\
    \ time between PCC and\n   PCE, PCE and VNTM, NMS and VNTM, and VNTM and LSR.\
    \  In the PCE-VNTM\n   and the NMS-VNTM cooperation models, the additional communication\n\
    \   steps are required compared with the higher-layer signaling trigger\n   model.\
    \  On the other hand, the cooperation model provides better\n   control at the\
    \ cost of a longer service setup time.\n   Note that, in terms of higher-layer\
    \ signaling time, in the higher-\n   layer signaling trigger model, the required\
    \ time from when higher-\n   layer signaling starts to when it is completed is\
    \ more than that of\n   the cooperation model except when a virtual TE link is\

- title: 5.4.  Network Complexity
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Network Complexity\n   If the higher- and lower-layer networks have multiple\
    \ interconnects,\n   then optimal path computation for end-to-end LSPs that cross\
    \ the\n   layer boundaries is non-trivial.  The higher-layer LSP must be routed\n\
    \   to the correct layer border nodes to achieve optimality in both\n   layers.\n\
    \   Where the lower-layer LSPs are advertised into the higher-layer\n   network\
    \ as TE links, the computation can be resolved in the higher-\n   layer network.\
    \  Care needs to be taken in the allocation of TE\n   metrics (i.e., costs) to\
    \ the lower-layer LSPs as they are advertised\n   as TE links into the higher-layer\
    \ network, and this might be a\n   function for a VNT Manager component.  Similarly,\
    \ attention should be\n   given to the fact that the LSPs crossing the lower-layer\
    \ network\n   might share points of common failure (e.g., they might traverse\
    \ the\n   same link in the lower-layer network) and the shared risk link groups\n\
    \   (SRLGs) for the TE links advertised in the higher-layer must be set\n   accordingly.\n\
    \   In the single PCE model, an end-to-end path can be found in a single\n   computation\
    \ because there is full visibility into both layers and all\n   possible paths\
    \ through all layer interconnects can be considered.\n   Where PCEs cooperate\
    \ to determine a path, an iterative computation\n   model such as [RFC5441] can\

  - "5.5.  Separation of Layer Management\n   Many network operators may want to provide\
    \ a clear separation between\n   the management of the different layer networks.\
    \  In some cases, the\n   lower-layer network may come from a separate commercial\
    \ arm of an\n   organization or from a different corporate body entirely.  In\
    \ these\n   cases, the policy applied to the establishment of LSPs in the lower-\n\
    \   layer network and to the advertisement of these LSPs as TE links in\n   the\
    \ higher-layer network will reflect commercial agreements and\n   security concerns\
    \ (see Section 8).  Since the capacity of the LSPs in\n   the lower-layer network\
    \ are likely to be significantly larger than\n   those in the client higher-layer\
    \ network (multiplex-server model),\n   the administrator of the lower-layer network\
    \ may want to exercise\n   caution before allowing a single small demand in the\
    \ higher layer to\n   tie up valuable resources in the lower layer.\n   The necessary\
    \ policy points for this separation of administration and\n   management are more\
    \ easily achieved through the VNTM approach than by\n   using triggered signaling.\
    \  In effect, the VNTM is the coordination\n   point for all lower-layer LSPs\
    \ and can be closely tied to a human\n   operator as well as to policy and billing.\
    \  Such a model can also be\n   achieved using triggered signaling.\n"
- title: 6.  Stability Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Stability Considerations\n   Inter-layer traffic engineering needs to be\
    \ managed and operated\n   correctly to avoid introducing instability problems.\n\
    \   Lower-layer LSPs are likely, by the nature of the technologies used\n   in\
    \ layered networks, to be of considerably higher capacity than the\n   higher-layer\
    \ LSPs.  This has the benefit of allowing multiple higher-\n   layer LSPs to be\
    \ carried across the lower-layer network in a single\n   lower-layer LSP.  However,\
    \ when a new lower-layer LSP is set up to\n   support a request for a higher-layer\
    \ LSP because there is no suitable\n   route in the higher-layer network, it may\
    \ be the case that a very\n   large LSP is established in support of a very small\
    \ traffic demand.\n   Further, if the higher-layer LSP is short-lived, the requirement\
    \ for\n   the lower-layer LSP will go away, either leaving it in place but\n \
    \  unused or requiring it to be torn down.  This may cause excessive\n   tie-up\
    \ of unused lower-layer network resources, or may introduce\n   instability into\
    \ the lower-layer network.  It is important that\n   appropriate policy controls\
    \ or configuration features are available\n   so that demand-led establishment\
    \ of lower-layer LSPs (the so-called\n   \"bandwidth on demand\") is filtered\
    \ according to the requirements of\n   the lower-layer network.\n   When a higher-layer\
    \ LSP is requested to be set up, a new lower-layer\n   LSP may be established\
    \ if there is no route with the requested\n   bandwidth for the higher-layer LSP.\
    \  After the lower-layer LSP is\n   established, existing high-layer LSPs could\
    \ be re-routed to use the\n   newly established lower-layer LSP, if using the\
    \ lower-layer LSP\n   provides a better route than that taken by the existing\
    \ LSPs.  This\n   re-routing may result in lower utilization of other lower-layer\
    \ LSPs\n   that used to carry the existing higher-layer LSPs.  When the\n   utilization\
    \ of a lower-layer LSP drops below a threshold (or drops to\n   zero), the LSP\
    \ is deleted according to lower-layer network policy.\n   But consider that some\
    \ other new higher-layer LSP may be requested at\n   once, requiring the establishment\
    \ or re-establishment of a lower-\n   layer LSP.  This, in turn, may cause higher-layer\
    \ re-routing, making\n   other lower-layer LSPs under-utilized in a cyclic manner.\
    \  This\n   behavior makes the higher-layer network unstable.\n   Inter-layer\
    \ traffic engineering needs to avoid network instability\n   problems.  To solve\
    \ the problem, network operators may have some\n   constraints achieved through\
    \ configuration or policy, where inter-\n   layer path control actions such as\
    \ re-routing and deletion of lower-\n   layer LSPs are not easily allowed.  For\
    \ example, threshold parameters\n   for the actions are determined so that hysteresis\
    \ control behavior\n   can be performed.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.1.3.  Control of Inter-Layer Policy\n   Probably the most important issue for\
    \ inter-layer traffic engineering\n   is inter-layer policy.  This may cover issues\
    \ such as under what\n   circumstances a lower-layer LSP may be established to\
    \ provide\n   connectivity in the higher-layer network.  Inter-layer policy may\n\
    \   exist to protect the lower-layer (high capacity) network from very\n   dynamic\
    \ changes in micro-demand in the higher-layer network (see\n   Section 6).  It\
    \ may also be used to ensure appropriate billing for\n   the lower-layer LSPs.\n\
    \   Inter-layer policy should include the definition of the points of\n   connectivity\
    \ between the network layers, the inter-layer TE model to\n   be applied (for\
    \ example, the selection between the models described\n   in this document), and\
    \ the rules for path computation and LSP setup.\n   Where inter-layer policy is\
    \ defined, it must be used consistently\n   throughout the network, and should\
    \ be made available to the PCEs that\n   perform inter-layer computation so that\
    \ appropriate paths are\n   computed.  Mechanisms for providing policy information\
    \ to PCEs are\n   discussed in [RFC5394].\n   VNTM may provide a suitable functional\
    \ component for the\n   implementation of inter-layer policy.  Use of VNTM allows\
    \ the\n   administrator of the lower-layer network to apply inter-layer policy\n\
    \   without making that policy public to the operator of the higher-layer\n  \
    \ network.  Similarly, a cooperative PCE model (with or without inter-\n   PCE\
    \ communication) allows separate application of policy during the\n   selection\

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Inter-layer traffic engineering with PCE raises\
    \ new security issues\n   in all three inter-layer path control models.\n   In\
    \ the cooperation model between PCE and VNTM, when the PCE\n   determines that\
    \ a new lower-layer LSP is desirable, communications\n   are needed between the\
    \ PCE and VNTM and between the VNTM and a border\n   LSR.  In this case, these\
    \ communications should have security\n   mechanisms to ensure authenticity, privacy,\
    \ and integrity of the\n   information exchanged.  In particular, it is important\
    \ to protect\n   against false triggers for LSP setup in the lower-layer network,\n\
    \   since such falsification could tie up lower-layer network resources\n   (achieving\
    \ a denial-of-service attack on the lower-layer network and\n   on the higher-layer\
    \ network that is attempting to use it) and could\n   result in incorrect billing\
    \ for services provided by the lower-layer\n   network.  Where the PCE MIB modules\
    \ are used to provide the\n   notification exchanges between the higher-layer\
    \ PCE and the VNTM,\n   SNMPv3 should be used to ensure adequate security.  Additionally,\
    \ the\n   VNTM should provide configurable or dynamic policy functions so that\n\
    \   the VNTM behavior upon receiving notification from a higher-layer PCE\n  \
    \ can be controlled.\n   The main security concern in the higher-layer signaling\
    \ trigger model\n   is related to confidentiality.  The PCE may inform a higher-layer\
    \ PCC\n   about a multi-layer path that includes an ERO in the lower-layer\n \
    \  network, but the PCC may not have TE topology visibility into the\n   lower-layer\
    \ network and might not be trusted with this information.\n   A loose hop across\
    \ the lower-layer network could be used, but this\n   decreases the benefit of\
    \ multi-layer traffic engineering.  A better\n   alternative may be to mask the\
    \ lower-layer path using a path key\n   [RFC5520] that can be expanded within\
    \ the lower-layer network.\n   Consideration must also be given to filtering the\
    \ recorded path\n   information from the lower-layer -- see [RFC4208], for example.\n\
    \   Additionally, in the higher-layer signaling trigger model,\n   consideration\
    \ must be given to the security of signaling at the\n   inter-layer interface,\
    \ since the layers may belong to different\n   administrative or trust domains.\n\
    \   The NMS-VNTM cooperation model introduces communication between the\n   NMS\
    \ and the VNTM.  Both of these components belong to the management\n   plane,\
    \ and such communication is out of scope for this PCE document.\n   Note that\
    \ the NMS-VNTM cooperation model may be considered to address\n   many security\
    \ and policy concerns because the control and decision-\n   making is placed within\
    \ the sphere of influence of the operator in\n   contrast to the more dynamic\
    \ mechanisms of the other models.\n   However, the security issues have simply\
    \ moved, and will require\n   authentication of operators and of policy.\n   Security\
    \ issues may also exist when a single PCE is granted full\n   visibility of TE\
    \ information that applies to multiple layers.  Any\n   access to the single PCE\
    \ will immediately gain access to the topology\n   information for all network\
    \ layers -- effectively, a single security\n   breach can expose information that\
    \ requires multiple breaches in\n   other models.\n   Note that, as described\
    \ in Section 6, inter-layer TE can cause\n   network stability issues, and this\
    \ could be leveraged to attack\n   either the higher- or lower-layer network.\
    \  Precautionary measures,\n   such as those described in Section 7.1.3, can be\
    \ applied through\n   policy or configuration to dampen any network oscillations.\n"
