  - "Status of this Memo\n   This RFC proposes a new option for Telnet for the ARPA-Internet\n
    \  community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n   Distribution
    of this memo is unlimited.\n"
  title: Status of this Memo
- contents:
  - "Overview\n   This proposed option would allow a Server-Telnet to send a banner
    to\n   a User-Telnet so that this banner would be displayed on the\n   workstation
    screen independently of the application software running\n   in the Server-Telnet.\n"

    output marking\n      (see below).\n"

  - "4.  Motivation for the Option\n   The security architecture of some military
    systems identifies a\n   security level with each Telnet connection.  There is
    a corresponding\n   need to display a security banner on visual display devices.\n
    \  (Reference: Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation\n   Criteria,
    Section 3.1.1.3.2.3, Labeling Human-Readable Output.)\n   The output marking is
    currently done by transmitting the banner as\n   data within each screen of data.
    \ It would be more efficient to\n   transmit the data once with instructions and
    have User-Telnet\n   maintain the banner automatically without any additional\n
    \  Server-Telnet action.  This frees Server-Telnet from needing to know\n   the
    output device page size.\n   Under this proposal Server-Telnet would send an option
    sequence with\n   the command, a control flag, and the banner to be used.  While\n
    \  current systems use the top of the screen, it is conceivable other\n   systems
    would want to put the banner at the bottom or perhaps even\n   the side of the
    screen.  This is the reason for the control flag.\n"

  - "5.  Description of the Option\n   Either side of the session can initiate the
    option; however, normally\n   it will be the server side that initiates the request
    to perform\n   output marking.  Either the Server-Telnet sends \"WILL OUTMRK\"
    or the\n   User-Telnet sends a \"DO OUTMRK\".  The party receiving the initial\n
    \  \"WILL\" (or \"DO\") would respond with \"DO\" (or \"WILL\") to accept the\n
    \  option.  Then Server-Telnet responds with the marking data.  The\n   format
    of this is:\n      \"IAC SB OUTMRK CNTL data IAC SE\"\n         CNTL is the Control
    Flag described below,\n         the data is in ASCII.\n   If this is satisfactory,
    User-Telnet responds:\n      \"IAC SB OUTMRK ACK IAC SE\"\n         ACK is the
    ASCII ACK (6).\n   From this point, User-Telnet will have to translate any command
    which\n   uses cursor controls so that the application data is mapped to the\n
    \  application part of the screen.\n   If the data passed in the subnegotiation
    field is unacceptable to\n   User-Telnet, then it responds with:\n      \"IAC
    SB OUTMRK NAK IAC SE\"\n         NAK is the ASCII NAK (21).\n   It is now up to
    Server-Telnet to start the sequence over again and\n   use \"more acceptable\"
    data (or possibly take other action such as\n   connection termination).\n   To
    terminate output marking, Server-Telnet transmits \"WON'T OUTMRK\".\n   If necessary,
    User-Telnet would notify Server-Telnet about the new\n   effective page size.
    \ User-Telnet would then map the output data to\n   the allowed usable space on
    the screen.\n   User-Telnet may request OUTMRK data or initiate setup of this\n
    \  convention at anytime by transmitting \"DO OUTMRK\".  If a WILL, DO\n   OUTMRK
    exchange is not followed by the OUTMRK subnegotiation of the\n   marking data,
    the User-Telnet may terminate the output marking option\n   by sending a \"DON'T
    OUTMRK\".\n   Control Flag\n      The CNTL flag is defined as:\n         D = Default,
    the placement of the markings is up to\n             User-Telnet.  This is the
    expected mode for most\n             interactions.\n         T = Top, this banner
    is to be used as the top of the screen.\n             If multiple output markings
    are desired, then T and B (or R\n             & L ) are to be used.\n         B
    = Bottom, this banner is to be used at the bottom of the\n             screen.\n
    \        L = Left, markings on the left.  (The precise meaning of this\n             is
    to be defined.)\n         R = Right, marking on right.  (The precise meaning of
    this is\n             to be defined.)\n   Banner Data\n      The use of Carriage
    Return and Line Feed (CRLF) will be\n      interpreted as a end of line in the
    marking banner text.  If the\n      user wants a multiline banner, CRLF will be
    used between each\n      line.  No CRLF is needed at the end of the marking data.\n
    \     To use multiple banners, all of the banners will be included in\n      one
    subnegotiation command of the form:\n         \"IAC SB OUTMRK CNTL data GS CNTL
    data IAC SE\"\n            where GS is the ASCII Group Separator (29) character.\n
    \     User-Telnet will be responsible for positioning the marking banner\n      data
    on the screen.\n"
