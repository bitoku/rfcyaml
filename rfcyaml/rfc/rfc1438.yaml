- title: Discussion
  contents:
  - "Discussion\n   The current IETF process has two types of RFCs: standards track\n\
    \   documents and other RFCs (e.g., informational, experimental, FYIs).\n   The\
    \ intent of the standards track documents is clear, and culminates\n   in an official\
    \ Internet Standard.  Informational RFCs can be\n   published on a less formal\
    \ basis, subject to the reasonable\n   constraints of the RFC Editor.  Informational\
    \ RFCs are not subject to\n   peer review and carry no significance whatsoever\
    \ within the IETF\n   process.\n   The IETF currently has no mechanism or means\
    \ of publishing documents\n   that express its deep concern about something important,\
    \ but\n   otherwise contain absolutely no useful information whatsoever.  This\n\
    \   document creates a new subseries of RFCs, entitled, IETF Statements\n   Of\
    \ Boredom (SOBs).  The SOB process is similar to that of the normal\n   standards\
    \ track.  The SOB is submitted to the IAB, the IRSG, the\n   IESG, the SOB Editor\
    \ (Morpheus), and the Academie Francais for\n   review, analysis, reproduction\
    \ in triplicate, translation into ASN.1,\n   and distribution to Internet insomniacs.\
    \  However, once everyone has\n   approved the document by falling asleep over\
    \ it, the process ends and\n   the document is discarded.  The resulting vacuum\
    \ is viewed as having\n   the technical approval of the IETF, but it is not, and\
    \ cannot become,\n   an official Internet Standard.\n"
