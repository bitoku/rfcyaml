  - "Tribute\n   In 1973, after doing interactive flight simulation over the ARPAnet,\n\
    \   I joined ISI and applied that experience to interactive speech over\n   the\
    \ ARPAnet.\n   The communication requirements for realtime speech were unique\
    \ (more\n   like UDP than like TCP).  This got me involved in the Network Working\n\
    \   Group, and I started another project at ISI called \"Internet\n   Concepts\"\
    .\n   In 1977 Steve Crocker, who was then at ISI, told me that Jon was\n   willing\
    \ to join us, and that Jon will be a great addition to my\n   Internet Concepts\
    \ project.  Steve was right on both accounts.\n   Jon and I worked together from\
    \ 1977 until 1993 when I left ISI.\n   According to ISI's management Jon worked\
    \ for me for several years,\n   and I worked for him for several years.  In reality\
    \ we never worked\n   for each other (nor for ISI), we always worked together,\
    \ to advance\n   the technology that we believed in.  Over most of those 16 years\
    \ we\n   had our offices together, and always worked with each other, even\n \
    \  when we worked on totally different projects.\n   Jon was always most pleasant\
    \ to work with.  He was most caring both\n   about the project, and about the\
    \ individuals on the team.  He was\n   always full of great intentions and humor.\
    \  Jon was always ready for\n   mischiefs, one way or another.  He was always\
    \ game to hack something.\n   When I worked on the MOSIS project, in 1980, users\
    \ submitted their\n   VLSI designs to us by e-mail.  For several defense contractors,\n\
    \   getting access to the ARPAnet was too complex.  We suggested that\n   they\
    \ would use a commercial e-mail service, like TELEmail, instead.\n   Then we had\
    \ the problem of getting all the e-mail systems to\n   interoperate, since none\
    \ of them was willing to interoperate with the\n   others.  Jon and I solved this\
    \ problem during one long night of\n   hacking.  This hack later became the mail-tunnel\
    \ that provided the\n   service known as \"InterMail\", for passing e-mail between\
    \ various\n   non-cooperating systems, including systems like MCImail and IEEE's\n\
    \   COMPmail.\n   I'm sure that Jon was so enthusiastic to work with me on it\
    \ for two\n   reasons:\n      * Such interoperability among heterogeneous e-mail\
    \ systems\n        was our religion, with no tolerance for separatism;\n     \
    \ * We definitely were not supposed to do it.\n   Jon hated bureaucracy and silly\
    \ rules, as Cary Thomas so well\n   described.  Too bad that we lived in an environment\
    \ with so many\n   rules.\n   We started Los-Nettos without lawyers and without\
    \ formal contracts.\n   Handshakes were good enough.  At that time several other\
    \ regional\n   networks started around the country.  Most of them were interested\
    \ in\n   expansion, in glory, and in fortune.  Jon was interested only in\n  \
    \ getting the problem solved.\n   This was Jon's priority, both at work, and in\
    \ his life.\n   I find it funny to read in the papers that Jon was the director\
    \ of\n   IANA.  Jon was IANA.  Much more important, Jon was the corporate\n  \
    \ memory of the Internet, and also the corporate style and the\n   technical taste\
    \ of the Internet.\n   Jon was an authority without bureaucracy.  No silly rules!\
    \  Jon's\n   authority was not derived from any management structure.  It was\
    \ due\n   to his personality, his dedication, deep understanding, and demanding\n\
    \   technical taste and style.\n   Jon set the standards for both the Internet\
    \ standards and for the\n   Internet standardization process.  Jon turned the\
    \ RFCs into a central\n   piece of the standardization process.\n   One can also\
    \ read that Jon was the editor of the RFC, and may think\n   that Jon checked\
    \ only the grammar or the format of the RFCs.  Nothing\n   could be further from\
    \ the truth, not that he did not check it, but in\n   addition, being the corporate\
    \ memory, Jon had indicated many times to\n   authors that earlier work had treated\
    \ the same subject, and that\n   their work would be improved by learning about\
    \ that earlier work.\n   For the benefits of those in the audience who are either\
    \ too young or\n   too old to remember let me recall some recent history:\n  \
    \ The Internet protocols (mainly IP, TCP, UDP, FTP, Telnet, FTP, and\n   even\
    \ SNMP) were defined and documented in their RFCs.  DoD adopted\n   them and announced\
    \ a date by which all of DoD units would have to use\n   TCP/IP.  They even translated\
    \ RFC791 from Jon's English to proper\n   Militarese.\n   However, all the other\
    \ countries (i.e., their governments and PTTs)\n   in the world joined the ISO\
    \ wagon, the X.25 based suite of OSI\n   protocols.  The US government joined\
    \ them and defined GOSIP. All the\n   large computer companies (from IBM and DEC\
    \ down) announced their\n   future plans to join the GOSIP bandwagon.  DoD totally\
    \ capitulated\n   and denounced the \"DoD unique protocols\" and was seeking ways\
    \ to\n   forget all about them, spending million of dollars on GOSIP and\n   X.500.\n\
    \   Against them, on the Internet side, there was a very small group of\n   young\
    \ Davids.  The OSI camp had its prestige, but we had working\n   systems, a large\
    \ community of devotees, and properly documented\n   protocols that allowed integration\
    \ of the TCP/IP suite into every\n   UNIX system, such as in every SUN workstation.\n\
    \   Against the strict laws in Europe, their universities developed an\n   underground\
    \ of Internet connections.  One could get from California\n   to the university\
    \ in Rome, for example, for example, by going first\n   over the Internet across\
    \ the US to the east coast, then to the UK,\n   then using some private lines\
    \ to France, then to CERN in Switzerland,\n   and from there to Rome - while breaking\
    \ the laws of all those\n   countries with every packet.\n   Meanwhile, in the\
    \ states, Academia, and the research communities,\n   never knew about GOSIP.\n\
    \   The Internet, against all the conventional wisdom, grew without\n   anyone\
    \ being in charge, without central control, and without any\n   central planning.\n\
    \   The war between the ISO and the TCP/IP camps never took place.  One\n   camp\
    \ turned out to be a no show.\n   What made it all possible was the wise selection\
    \ of what to\n   standardize and what not to, and the high quality of the standards\
    \ in\n   a series of living documents.\n   Our foundation and infrastructure of\
    \ standards was the secret weapon\n   that won the war.  Jon created it, using\
    \ the RFC mechanism initiated\n   by Steve Crocker.  It was Jon who immediately\
    \ realized their\n   importance, and the need for someone to act as the curator,\
    \ and\n   volunteered.\n   The lightning speed with which Microsoft joined the\
    \ Internet was not\n   possible without the quality of the existing standards\
    \ that were so\n   well documented.\n   During the transition from ARPA, through\
    \ the NSF, to the commercial\n   world there was a point in which the trivial\
    \ funding required for the\n   smooth operation of editing and distributing the\
    \ RFCs was in doubt.\n   At that time the prospect of not having funds to run\
    \ this operation\n   was very real.  Finally the problem was solved and the process\n\
    \   suffered no interruption.\n   What most of the involved agencies and managers\
    \ did not know is that\n   there was never a danger of any interruption.  Jon\
    \ would have done it\n   even with no external funding.  If they did not pay him\
    \ to do it, he\n   would have paid them to let him do it.  For him it was not\
    \ a job, it\n   was labor of love.\n   Jon never joined the PowerPoint generation.\
    \  Jon always believed that\n   the content was the only thing that matters. \
    \ Hand written slides\n   were good enough.  Color and logos were distractions,\
    \ a necessary\n   evil in certain occasions, not the style of choice.\n   Jon\
    \ defined quality by counting interesting ideas, not points per\n   inch.\n  \
    \ When fancy formatting creeped into the Internet community, Jon\n   resisted\
    \ the temptation to allow fancy formats for RFCs.  Instead, he\n   insisted on\
    \ them being in ASCII, easy to e-mail, guaranteed to be\n   readable anywhere\
    \ in the world.  The instant availability and\n   usability of RFCs was much more\
    \ important to him than how fancy they\n   looked.\n   The Internet was not just\
    \ a job for Jon.  It was his hobby and his\n   mission in life.\n   We will miss\
    \ Jon, who was for the Internet its corporate memory, its\n   corporate style,\
    \ and its corporate taste.\n   I will miss him even more as a colleague and a\
    \ friend.\n"
