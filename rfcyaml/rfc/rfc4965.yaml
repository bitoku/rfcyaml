- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document contains a set of principles and guidelines\
    \ that serves\n   as the basis for establishing a liaison relationship between\
    \ the\n   Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. and the Internet Engineering Task\n\
    \   Force (IETF).  This cooperation framework is intended to secure\n   timely\
    \ development of technical specifications that facilitate\n   maximum interoperability\
    \ with existing Internet systems, devices, and\n   protocols.\n   CableLabs is\
    \ a non-profit research and development consortium that is\n   dedicated to pursuing\
    \ new cable telecommunications technologies and\n   to helping its cable operator\
    \ members integrate those technical\n   advancements into their business objectives.\
    \  Within CableLabs,\n   specification activities are organized into projects\
    \ such as\n   DOCSIS(r), PacketCable(tm), and OpenCable(tm), and technical work\
    \ is\n   conducted in focus teams.  Product vendors, manufacturers, and cable\n\
    \   operator members are invited to join the focus teams that create\n   technical\
    \ specifications.  From time to time, individuals involved\n   with CableLabs\
    \ focus teams submit CableLabs technical requirements or\n   requirement specifications\
    \ to IETF in order to seek expert reviews\n   and solicit comments to create solutions\
    \ that foster product\n   interoperability beyond cable.  The submissions related\
    \ to CableLabs\n   specifications may, for example, include use cases, protocol\n\
    \   requirements, draft MIB modules, and proposed solutions such as new\n   DHCP\
    \ options.  CableLabs also references the work of IETF and Request\n   For Comments\
    \ in its specifications.  The list of CableLabs projects\n   and specifications\
    \ available publicly can be found at the CableLabs\n   Web site, http://www.cablelabs.com.\n\
    \   Within the IETF, activities are undertaken within a framework of\n   Areas,\
    \ with specific activities being undertaken by working groups\n   that are chartered\
    \ within each Area.  Working group output is\n   reviewed by the Internet Engineering\
    \ Steering Group (IESG) and\n   published by the RFC Editor.  IETF activities\
    \ are based on a\n   principle of open contribution and participation by any interested\n\
    \   party.  Details on the Internet Standards Process followed by the\n   IETF\
    \ can be found in [RFC2026].  Information on IETF working groups,\n   current\
    \ work item drafts, meeting schedules, and mailing lists are\n   published on\
    \ the IETF Web site, http://www.ietf.org.\n   The IETF and CableLabs are forming\
    \ a liaison relationship with a\n   mutual desire to support the integrity of\
    \ specifications developed by\n   each body.  CableLabs does not develop standards\
    \ other than through\n   its participation with Standards Defining Organizations\
    \ (SDOs) like\n   the IETF.\n   The preferred approach is that CableLabs uses\
    \ the IETF specifications\n   unchanged, if feasible, and communicates requirements\
    \ for change to\n   the IETF, as needed.  The parties intend to work together\
    \ in an\n   effort to avoid duplication of work.\n   Within the framework of this\
    \ liaison relationship, each organization\n   will operate according to its own\
    \ rules and procedures, including\n   rules governing Intellectual Property Rights\
    \ (IPR), specification\n   elaboration, approval, and maintenance.\n"
- title: 2.  Basis of Collaboration
  contents:
  - "2.  Basis of Collaboration\n   In the further development of CableLabs specifications,\
    \ the benefit\n   of adopting IETF specifications has been identified.  Although\
    \ this\n   document recognizes the importance of interoperability of the\n   CableLabs\
    \ specifications with the existing Internet and hence the use\n   of IETF standards,\
    \ CableLabs recognizes that additions or\n   modifications might be needed in\
    \ order to make the IETF\n   specifications meet the needs of CableLabs.  In such\
    \ cases, a\n   CableLabs individual or a vendor participant working on a CableLabs\n\
    \   specification may take its concerns directly to the appropriate IETF\n   working\
    \ groups for resolution.  When no appropriate working group can\n   be found or\
    \ it is not known where to direct the communication, or in\n   the case of resolution\
    \ of consequent matters, the issue will be\n   raised through the CableLabs designated\
    \ liaison manager to the IETF\n   liaison manager.\n   The IETF may also need\
    \ to ask questions of CableLabs in order to\n   refine its understanding of CableLabs\
    \ requirements or may wish to\n   offer guidance to CableLabs on the effective\
    \ use of IETF\n   specifications.  Where possible, these communications will occur\
    \ in\n   the context of a discussion between CableLabs and an IETF working\n \
    \  group.  In the event that a working-group-level discussion is deemed\n   inappropriate\
    \ for the desired communication, the matter will be\n   raised through the IETF's\
    \ designated liaison manager to CableLabs.\n"
- title: 3.  Document Sharing
  contents:
  - "3.  Document Sharing\n   Both CableLabs and the IETF encourage the sharing of\
    \ specification\n   documents and draft requirements that are of mutual interest.\n\
    \   All IETF documents are publicly available from the IETF Web site, and\n  \
    \ discussion of documents is hosted on open mailing lists.\n   CableLabs documents\
    \ intended for public consumption include CableLabs\n   Technical Reports and\
    \ CableLabs Specifications that are in an\n   approved and published status. \
    \ These documents have the CableLabs\n   ISSUED status and are published for open\
    \ access on CableLabs' Web\n   site, http://www.cablelabs.com, or\n   http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/archives/.\n\
    \   In order for the IETF to make any reference (informative or\n   normative),\
    \ the document must be in an approved and published state,\n   and publicly available.\
    \  It is expected that CableLabs will share\n   relevant information with IETF\
    \ participants via individual IETF\n   Contributions, as described in [RFC3978],\
    \ and without requiring a\n   non-disclosure agreement.\n   CableLabs and the\
    \ IETF will work to update and exchange, when\n   appropriate and on a regular\
    \ basis, a list of dependencies between\n   each organization's specifications\
    \ and work in progress.\n"
- title: 4.  Participation in the IETF Process
  contents:
  - "4.  Participation in the IETF Process\n   The Internet Standards Process is described\
    \ in [RFC2026].\n   Participation in the IETF process is open to any individual\
    \ willing\n   to contribute.  This naturally includes individuals who also\n \
    \  represent or otherwise contribute to the development of CableLabs\n   specifications.\
    \  Such individuals may freely participate in IETF\n   mailing list discussions,\
    \ submit and review Internet Drafts, and\n   attend IETF meetings in order to\
    \ assist the IETF in refining its\n   understanding of CableLabs requirements\
    \ as well as offering CableLabs\n   an opportunity to receive informal guidance\
    \ on CableLabs' use of IETF\n   specifications.  The vast majority of technical\
    \ discussions and\n   decision making within the IETF is undertaken on open mailing\
    \ lists.\n   Interested individuals should subscribe to and participate on these\n\
    \   lists.\n"
- title: 5.  Designated Liaison Managers and Responsibilities
  contents:
  - "5.  Designated Liaison Managers and Responsibilities\n   When the informal working\
    \ group level of interaction is insufficient,\n   matters can be raised through\
    \ a liaison channel.  CableLabs and the\n   IETF shall each establish liaison\
    \ functions for communication with\n   the other organization and each shall appoint\
    \ one individual acting\n   as a liaison manager as described in [RFC4052] and\
    \ [RFC4053].\n   Formal communications from CableLabs will be initiated by the\n\
    \   designated CableLabs liaison manager by sending a liaison statement\n   to\
    \ the IETF liaison manager; these must follow the procedures\n   described in\
    \ [RFC4053].  The role of the IETF liaison manager is\n   defined in [RFC4052]\
    \ and [RFC4691].  The IETF liaison manager is not\n   responsible for notifying\
    \ CableLabs of new work to be undertaken by\n   the IETF.  Instead, the designated\
    \ CableLabs liaison manager or\n   delegates should subscribe to IETF lists announcing\
    \ the creation or\n   rechartering of IETF working groups (ietf-announce) and\
    \ the lists\n   announcing new work (new-work).\n"
- title: 5.1.  IETF Liaison Manager to CableLabs
  contents:
  - "5.1.  IETF Liaison Manager to CableLabs\n   The preferred way for organizations\
    \ to work with IETF is through the\n   working groups.  However, IETF has a limited\
    \ number of liaison\n   relationships and liaison managers with other organizations\
    \ when\n   conditions warrant the appointment of a specific person.\n   The Internet\
    \ Architecture Board (IAB) shall appoint a specific person\n   to serve as the\
    \ IETF liaison manager to CableLabs.  The role and\n   responsibilities of the\
    \ IETF liaison manager to CableLabs are\n   described below.  In particular, it\
    \ is expected that the designated\n   liaison manager will act as an initial contact\
    \ point in IETF for\n   administrative aspects of this collaboration that cannot\
    \ easily be\n   handled in other ways (e.g., at a technical level by interactions\n\
    \   with IETF Working Groups or Area Directors).  It is agreed that the\n   role\
    \ does not carry the expectation of attendance at CableLabs\n   meetings or participation\
    \ in CableLabs specification development\n   processes, and it is anticipated\
    \ that all liaison efforts assigned to\n   this individual will be carried out\
    \ by electronic mail.  It is\n   understood that the IETF liaison manager does\
    \ not have the ability to\n   make exceptions to, or special provisions for, IETF\
    \ policies and\n   procedures.\n   It is expected that the individual appointed\
    \ to the liaison manager\n   role would:\n   o  perform all tasks as defined in\
    \ [RFC4052] and [RFC4691],\n   o  be informed by CableLabs, when appropriate,\
    \ of CableLabs\n      activities within the IETF, including new work proposals,\
    \ and be\n      able to report those using appropriate channels within the IETF,\n\
    \   o  convey liaison statements from the IETF to CableLabs as described\n   \
    \   in [RFC4053], and be responsible for shepherding CableLabs\n      communication\
    \ to the relevant parts of the IETF,\n   o  be able to raise issues with CableLabs\
    \ technical leadership as\n      well as the IAB members and IETF Area Directors,\
    \ as required.\n   CableLabs meetings are normally only open to delegates from\
    \ CableLabs\n   members or those manufacturers who have signed the appropriate\n\
    \   agreements to participate in CableLabs projects or meetings.\n"
- title: 5.2.  CableLabs Liaison Manager to IETF
  contents:
  - "5.2.  CableLabs Liaison Manager to IETF\n   CableLabs shall establish an IETF\
    \ liaison function and name an\n   individual to be the CableLabs liaison Manager\
    \ to IETF for matters\n   pertaining to the CableLabs-IETF cooperation.  The CableLabs\
    \ liaison\n   manager to IETF is expected to work with the concerned IETF and\n\
    \   CableLabs projects and focus teams and to support the interaction\n   between\
    \ CableLabs and the IETF.\n"
- title: 6.  Formal Liaison Statements
  contents:
  - "6.  Formal Liaison Statements\n   Whenever possible, and as the preferred primary\
    \ method of\n   communication and coordination of activity, communication at the\n\
    \   working group level is strongly encouraged.\n   When deemed necessary, formal\
    \ communication between CableLabs and\n   IETF is also permitted.  These communications\
    \ are to be recorded in\n   the form of Liaison Statements, and the IETF will\
    \ use the CableLabs\n   liaison manager to convey these statements between the\
    \ IETF and\n   CableLabs.  The procedure for proper handling of incoming liaison\n\
    \   statements defined in [RFC4053] must be followed by both the liaison\n   manager\
    \ named by IETF and the liaison manager designated by\n   CableLabs.  It is important\
    \ to note that all liaison statements made\n   by the IETF or directed to the\
    \ IETF shall be published by the IETF as\n   public documents.  All liaison statements\
    \ made by the IETF will\n   comply with the IETF IPR policy as documented in [RFC3978],\n\
    \   [RFC3979], [RFC4748], [RFC4371] and any updates.\n"
- title: 7.  Contributions
  contents:
  - "7.  Contributions\n   Individuals who are involved in CableLabs' projects and\
    \ are willing\n   to contribute to IETF may make contributions to the IETF in\
    \ their\n   capacity as IETF participants, under the IETF's IPR policy, as\n \
    \  documented in [RFC3978] and [RFC3979].\n   IETF participants whose companies\
    \ are CableLabs members or have\n   signed the appropriate agreements with CableLabs\
    \ may also make\n   contributions to CableLabs' projects and specifications.\n\
    \   CableLabs mailing lists are not open to the general public.  It is\n   recommended\
    \ that work of mutual interest be discussed on the relevant\n   IETF mailing lists.\n\
    \   The IETF and CableLabs will not co-develop any documents or material.\n"
