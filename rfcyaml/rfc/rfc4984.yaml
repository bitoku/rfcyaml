  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is commonly recognized that today's Internet routing\
    \ and\n   addressing system is facing serious scaling problems.  The ever-\n \
    \  increasing user population, as well as multiple other factors\n   including\
    \ multi-homing, traffic engineering, and policy routing, have\n   been driving\
    \ the growth of the Default Free Zone (DFZ) routing table\n   size at an increasing\
    \ and potentially alarming rate [DFZ][BGT04].\n   While it has been long recognized\
    \ that the existing routing\n   architecture may have serious scalability problems,\
    \ effective\n   solutions have yet to be identified, developed, and deployed.\n\
    \   As a first step towards tackling these long-standing concerns, the\n   IAB\
    \ held a \"Routing and Addressing Workshop\" in Amsterdam,\n   Netherlands on\
    \ October 18-19, 2006.  The main objectives of the\n   workshop were to identify\
    \ existing and potential factors that have\n   major impacts on routing scalability,\
    \ and to develop a concise\n   problem statement that may serve as input to a\
    \ set of follow-on\n   activities.  This document reports on the outcome from\
    \ that workshop.\n   The remainder of the document is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2\n   provides an executive summary of the workshop findings.  Section 3\n \
    \  describes the sources of stress in the current global routing and\n   addressing\
    \ system.  Section 4 discusses the relationship between\n   Moore's law and our\
    \ ability to build large routers.  Section 5\n   describes a few foreseeable factors\
    \ that may exacerbate the current\n   problems outlined in Section 2.  Section\
    \ 6 describes previous work in\n   this area.  Section 7 describes the problem\
    \ statements in more\n   detail, and Section 8 discusses the criteria that constrain\
    \ the\n   solution space.  Finally, Section 9 summarizes the recommendations\n\
    \   made by the workshop participants.\n   The workshop participant list is attached\
    \ in Appendix B.  The agenda\n   can be found in Appendix C, and Appendix D provides\
    \ pointers to the\n   presentations from the workshop.\n   Finally, note that\
    \ this document is a report on the outcome of the\n   workshop, not an official\
    \ document of the IAB.  Any opinions\n   expressed are those of the workshop participants\
    \ and not of the IAB.\n"
- title: 2.  Key Findings from the Workshop
  contents:
  - "2.  Key Findings from the Workshop\n   This section provides a concise summary\
    \ of the key findings from the\n   workshop.  While many other aspects of a routing\
    \ and addressing\n   system were discussed, the first two problems described in\
    \ this\n   section were deemed the most important ones by the workshop\n   participants.\n\
    \   The clear, highest-priority takeaway from the workshop is the need to\n  \
    \ devise a scalable routing and addressing system, one that is scalable\n   in\
    \ the face of multihoming, and that facilitates a wide spectrum of\n   traffic\
    \ engineering (TE) requirements.  Several scalability problems\n   of the current\
    \ routing and addressing systems were discussed, most\n   related to the size\
    \ of the DFZ routing table (frequently referred to\n   as the Routing Information\
    \ Base, or RIB) and its implications.  Those\n   implications included (but were\
    \ not limited to) the sizes of the DFZ\n   RIB and FIB (the Forwarding Information\
    \ Base), the cost of\n   recomputing the FIB, concerns about the BGP convergence\
    \ times in the\n   presence of growing RIB and FIB sizes, and the costs and power\
    \ (and\n   hence heat dissipation) properties of the hardware needed to route\n\
    \   traffic in the core of the Internet.\n"
- title: '2.1.  Problem #1: The Scalability of the Routing System'
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Problem #1: The Scalability of the Routing System\n   The shape of the\
    \ growth curve of the DFZ RIB has been the topic of\n   much research and discussion\
    \ since the early days of the Internet\n   [H03].  There have been various hypotheses\
    \ regarding the sources of\n   this growth.  The workshop identified the following\
    \ factors as the\n   main driving forces behind the rapid growth of the DFZ RIB:\n\
    \   o  Multihoming,\n   o  Traffic engineering,\n   o  Non-aggregatable address\
    \ allocations (a big portion of which is\n      inherited from historical allocations),\
    \ and\n   o  Business events, such as mergers and acquisitions.\n   All of the\
    \ above factors can lead to prefix de-aggregation and/or the\n   injection of\
    \ unaggregatable prefixes into the DFZ RIB.  Prefix de-\n   aggregation leads\
    \ to an uncontrolled DFZ RIB growth because, absent\n   some non-topologically\
    \ based routing technology (for example, Routing\n   On Flat Labels [ROFL] or\
    \ any name-independent compact routing\n   algorithm, e.g., [CNIR]), topological\
    \ aggregation is the only known\n   practical approach to control the growth of\
    \ the DFZ RIB.  The\n   following section reviews the workshop discussion of the\
    \ implications\n   of the growth of the DFZ RIB.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Implications of DFZ RIB Growth
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Implications of DFZ RIB Growth\n   Presentations made at the workshop\
    \ showed that the DFZ RIB has been\n   growing at greater than linear rates for\
    \ several years [DFZ].  While\n   this has the obvious effects on the requirements\
    \ for RIB and FIB\n   memory sizes, the growth driven by prefix de-aggregation\
    \ also exposes\n   the core of the network to the dynamic nature of the edges,\
    \ i.e., the\n   de-aggregation leads to an increased number of BGP UPDATE messages\n\
    \   injected into the DFZ (frequently referred to as \"UPDATE churn\").\n   Consequently,\
    \ additional processing is required to maintain state for\n   the longer prefixes\
    \ and to update the FIB.  Note that, although the\n   size of the RIB is bounded\
    \ by the given address space size and the\n   number of reachable hosts (i.e.,\
    \ O(m*2^32) for IPv4, where <m> is the\n   average number of peers each BGP router\
    \ may have), the amount of\n   protocol activity required to distribute dynamic\
    \ topological changes\n   is not.  That is, the amount of BGP UPDATE churn that\
    \ the network can\n   experience is essentially unbounded.  It was also noted\
    \ that the\n   UPDATE churn, as currently measured, is heavy-tailed [ATNAC2006].\n\
    \   That is, a relatively small number of Autonomous Systems (ASs) or\n   prefixes\
    \ are responsible for a disproportionately large fraction of\n   the UPDATE churn\
    \ that we observe today.  Furthermore, much of the\n   churn may turn out to be\
    \ unnecessary information, possibly due to\n   instability of edge ASs being injected\
    \ into the global routing system\n   [DynPrefix], or arbitrage of some bandwidth\
    \ pricing model (see [GIH],\n   for example, or the discussion of the behavior\
    \ of AS 9121 in\n   [BGP2005]).\n   Finally, it was noted by the workshop participants\
    \ that the UPDATE\n   churn situation may be exacerbated by the current Regional\
    \ Internet\n   Registry (RIR) policy in which end sites are allocated Provider-\n\
    \   Independent (PI) addresses.  These addresses are not topologically\n   aggregatable,\
    \ and as such, bring the churn problem described above\n   into the core routing\
    \ system.  Of course, as noted by several\n   participants, the RIRs have no real\
    \ choice in this matter, as many\n   enterprises demand PI addresses that allow\
    \ them to multihome without\n   the \"provider lock\" that Provider-Allocated\
    \ (PA) [PIPA] address space\n   creates.  Some enterprises also find the renumbering\
    \ cost associated\n   with PA address assignments unacceptable.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Implications of DFZ FIB Growth
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Implications of DFZ FIB Growth\n   One surprising outcome of the workshop\
    \ was the observation made by\n   Tony Li about the relationship between \"Moore's\
    \ Law\" [ML] and our\n   ability to build cost-effective, high-performance routers\
    \ (see\n   Appendix D).  \"Moore's Law\" is the empirical observation that the\n\
    \   transistor density of integrated circuits, with respect to minimum\n   component\
    \ cost, doubles roughly every 24 months.  A commonly held\n   wisdom is that Moore's\
    \ law would save the day by ensuring that\n   technology will continue to scale\
    \ at historical rates that surpass\n   the growth rate of routing information\
    \ handled by core router\n   hardware.  However, Li pointed out that Moore's Law\
    \ does not apply to\n   building high-end routers as far as the cost is concerned.\n\
    \   Moore's Law applies specifically to the high-volume portion of the\n   semiconductor\
    \ industry, while the low-volume, customized silicon used\n   in core routing\
    \ is well off Moore's Law's cost curve.  In particular,\n   off-chip SRAM is commonly\
    \ used for storing FIB data, and the driver\n   for low-latency, high-capacity\
    \ SRAM used to be PC cache memory.\n   However, recently cache memory has been\
    \ migrating directly onto the\n   processor die, and cell phones are now the primary\
    \ driver for off-\n   chip SRAM.  Given cell phones require low-power, small-capacity\
    \ parts\n   that are not applicable to high-end routers, the SRAMs that are\n\
    \   favored for router design are not volume parts and do not track with\n   Moore's\
    \ law.\n"
- title: '2.2.  Problem #2: The Overloading of IP Address Semantics'
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Problem #2: The Overloading of IP Address Semantics\n   One of the fundamental\
    \ assumptions underlying the scalability of\n   routing systems was eloquently\
    \ stated by Yakov Rekhter (and is\n   sometimes referred to as \"Rekhter's Law\"\
    ), namely:\n        \"Addressing can follow topology or topology can follow\n\
    \         addressing. Choose one.\"\n   The same idea was expressed by Mike O'Dell's\
    \ design of an alternate\n   address architecture for ipv6 [GSE], where the address\
    \ structure was\n   designed specifically to enable \"aggressive topological aggregation\"\
    \n   to scale the routing system.  Noel Chiappa has also written\n   extensively\
    \ on this topic (see, e.g., [EID]).\n   There is, however, a difficulty in creating\
    \ (and maintaining) the\n   kind of congruence envisioned by Rekhter's Law in\
    \ today's Internet.\n   The difficulty arises from the overloading of addressing\
    \ with the\n   semantics of both \"who\" (endpoint identifier, as used by transport\n\
    \   layer) and \"where\" (locators for the routing system); some might also\n\
    \   add that IP addresses are also overloaded with \"how\" [GIH].  In any\n  \
    \ event, this kind of overloading is felt to have had deep implications\n   for\
    \ the scalability of the global routing system.\n   A refinement to Rekhter's\
    \ Law, then, is that for the Internet routing\n   system to scale, an IP address\
    \ must be assigned in such a way that it\n   is congruent with the Internet's\
    \ topology.  However, identifiers are\n   typically assigned based upon organizational\
    \ (not topological)\n   structure and have stability as a desirable property,\
    \ a \"natural\n   incongruence\" arises.  As a result, it is difficult (if not\n\
    \   impossible) to make a single number space serve both purposes\n   efficiently.\n\
    \   Following the logic of the previous paragraphs, workshop participants\n  \
    \ concluded that the so-called \"locator/identifier overload\" of the IP\n   address\
    \ semantics is one of the causes of the routing scalability\n   problem as we\
    \ see today.  Thus, a \"split\" seems necessary to scale\n   the routing system,\
    \ although how to actually architect and implement\n   such a split was not explored\
    \ in detail.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Other Concerns
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Other Concerns\n   In addition to the issues described in Section 2.1 and\
    \ Section 2.2,\n   the workshop participants also identified the following three\n\
    \   pressing, but \"second tier\", issues.\n   The first one is a general concern\
    \ with IPv6 deployment.  It is\n   commonly believed that the IPv4 address space\
    \ has put an effective\n   constraint on the IPv4 RIB growth.  Once this constraint\
    \ is lifted by\n   the deployment of IPv6, and in the absence of a scalable routing\n\
    \   strategy, the rapid DFZ RIB size growth problem today can potentially\n  \
    \ be exacerbated by IPv6's much larger address space.  The only routing\n   paradigm\
    \ available today for IPv6 is a combination of Classless\n   Inter-Domain Routing\
    \ (CIDR) [RFC4632] and Provider-Independent (PI)\n   address allocation strategies\
    \ [PIPA] (and possibly SHIM6 [SHIM6] when\n   that technology is developed and\
    \ deployed).  Thus, the opportunity\n   exists to create a \"swamp\" (unaggregatable\
    \ address space) that can be\n   many orders of magnitude larger than what we\
    \ faced with IPv4.  In\n   short, the advent of IPv6 and its larger address space\
    \ further\n   underscores both the concerns raised in Section 2.1, and the\n \
    \  importance of resolving the architectural issue raised in\n   Section 2.2.\n\
    \   The second issue is slow routing convergence.  In particular, the\n   concern\
    \ was that growth in the number of routes that service\n   providers must carry\
    \ will cause routing convergence to become a\n   significant problem.\n   The\
    \ third issue is the misalignment of costs and benefits in today's\n   routing\
    \ system.  While the IETF does not typically consider the\n   \"business model\"\
    \ impacts of various technology choices, many\n   participants felt that perhaps\
    \ the time has come to review that\n   philosophy.\n"
- title: 2.4.  How Urgent Are These Problems?
  contents:
  - "2.4.  How Urgent Are These Problems?\n   There was a fairly universal agreement\
    \ among the workshop\n   participants that the problems outlined in Section 2.1\
    \ and\n   Section 2.2 need immediate attention.  This need was not because the\n\
    \   participants perceived a looming, well-defined \"hit the wall\" date,\n  \
    \ but rather because these are difficult problems that to date have\n   resisted\
    \ solution, are likely to get more unwieldy as IPv6 deployment\n   proceeds, and\
    \ the development and deployment of an effective solution\n   will necessarily\
    \ take at least a few years.\n"
- title: 3.  Current Stresses on the Routing and Addressing System
  contents:
  - "3.  Current Stresses on the Routing and Addressing System\n   The primary concern\
    \ voiced by the workshop participants regarding the\n   state of the current Internet\
    \ routing system was the rapid growth of\n   the DFZ RIB.  The number of entries\
    \ in 2005 ranged from about 150,000\n   entries to 175,000 entries [BGP2005];\
    \ this number has reached 200,000\n   as of October 2006 [CIDRRPT], and is projected\
    \ to increase to 370,000\n   or more within 5 years [Fuller].  Some workshop participants\n\
    \   projected that the DFZ could reach 2 million entries within 15 years,\n  \
    \ and there might be as many as 10 million multihomed sites by 2050.\n   Another\
    \ related concern was the number of prefixes changed, added,\n   and withdrawn\
    \ as a function of time (i.e., BGP UPDATE churn).  This\n   has a detrimental\
    \ impact on routing convergence, since UPDATEs\n   frequently necessitate a re-computation\
    \ and download of the FIB.  For\n   example, a BGP router may observe up to 500,000\
    \ BGP updates in a\n   single day [DynPrefix], with the peak arrival rates over\
    \ 1000 updates\n   per second.  Such UPDATE churn problems are not limited to\

  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Avoiding Renumbering\n   The workshop participants noted that customers\
    \ generally prefer to\n   have PI address space.  Doing so gives them additional\
    \ agility in\n   selecting ISPs and helps them avoid the need to renumber.  Many\
    \ end-\n   systems use DHCP to assign addresses, so a cursory analysis might\n\
    \   suggest renumbering might involve modification of a modest number of\n   routers\
    \ and servers (perhaps rather than end hosts) at a site that\n   was forced to\
    \ renumber.\n   In reality, however, renumbering can be more cumbersome because\
    \ IP\n   addresses are often used for other purposes such as access control\n\
    \   lists.  They are also sometimes hard-coded into applications used in\n   environments\
    \ where failure of the DNS would be catastrophic (e.g.,\n   some remote monitoring\
    \ applications).  Although renumbering may be a\n   mild inconvenience for some\
    \ sites and guidelines have been developed\n   for renumbering a network without\
    \ a flag day [RFC4192], for others,\n   the necessary changes are sufficiently\
    \ difficult so as to make\n   renumbering effectively impossible.\n   For these\
    \ reasons, PI address space is sought by a growing number of\n   customers.  Current\
    \ RIR policy reflects this trend, and their policy\n   is to allocate PI prefixes\
    \ to all customers who claim a need.\n   Routing PI prefixes requires additional\
    \ entries in the DFZ routing\n   and forwarding tables.  At present, ISPs do not\
    \ typically charge to\n   route PI prefixes.  Therefore, the \"costs\" of the\
    \ additional\n   prefixes, in terms of routing table entries and processing overhead,\n\
    \   is born by the global routing system as a whole, rather than directly\n  \
    \ by the users of PI space.  The workshop participants observed that no\n   strong\
    \ disincentive exists to discourage the increasing use of PI\n   address space.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Multihoming\n   Multihoming refers generically to the case in which a\
    \ site is served\n   by more than one ISP [RFC4116].  There are several reasons\
    \ for the\n   observed increase in multihoming, including the increased reliance\
    \ on\n   the Internet for mission- and business-critical applications and the\n\
    \   general decrease in cost to obtain Internet connectivity.\n   Multihoming\
    \ provides backup routing -- Internet connection\n   redundancy; in some circumstances,\
    \ multihoming is mandatory due to\n   contract or law.  Multihoming can be accomplished\
    \ using either PI or\n   PA address space, and multihomed sites generally have\
    \ their own AS\n   numbers (although some do not; this generally occurs when such\n\
    \   customers are statically routed).\n   A multihomed site using PI address space\
    \ has its prefixes present in\n   the forwarding and routing tables of each of\
    \ its providers.  For PA\n   space, each prefix allocated from one provider's\
    \ address allocation\n   will be aggregatable for that provider but not the others.\
    \  If the\n   addresses are allocated from a 'primary' ISP (i.e., one that the\
    \ site\n   uses for routing unless a failure occurs), then the additional\n  \
    \ routing table entries only appear during path failures to that\n   primary ISP.\
    \  A problem with multihoming arises when a customer's PA\n   IP prefixes are\
    \ advertised by AS(es) other than their 'primary'\n   ISP's.  Because of the longest-matching\
    \ prefix forwarding rule, in\n   this case, the customer's traffic will be directed\
    \ through the non-\n   primary AS(s).  In response, the primary ISP is forced\
    \ to de-\n   aggregate the customer's prefix in order to keep the customer's\n\
    \   traffic flowing through it instead of the non-primary AS(s).\n"

    \   performed by both ISPs and customer networks, for three primary\n   reasons:\n\

    \    or to spread the traffic load across multiple links (frequently\n      referred\

    \ to lower cost paths or\n      by balancing the incoming and outgoing traffic\

    \   operators usually achieve traffic engineering by \"tweaking\" the\n   processing\
    \ of routing protocols to achieve desired results.  At the\n   BGP level, if the\
    \ address range requiring TE is a portion of a larger\n   PA address aggregate,\

    \ TE to\n   maintain good performance and low cost in their networks.  However,\n\
    \   the current practice of TE deployment results in an increase of the\n   DFZ\

    \ routers.  The scalability of the current routing subsystem manifests\n   itself\
    \ in the forwarding table (FIB) and routing table (RIB) of the\n   routers in\

- title: 4.1.  Moore's Law
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Moore's Law\n   In 1965, Gordon Moore projected that the density of transistors\
    \ in\n   integrated circuits could double every two years, with respect to\n \
    \  minimum component cost.  The period was subsequently adjusted to be\n   between\
    \ 18-24 months and this conjecture became known as Moore's Law\n   [ML].  The\
    \ semiconductor industry has been following this density\n   trend for the last\
    \ 40 or so years.\n   The commonly held wisdom is that Moore's law will save the\
    \ day by\n   ensuring that technology will continue to scale at the historical\n\
    \   rate that will surpass the growth rate of routing information.\n   However,\
    \ it is vital to understand that Moore's law comes out of the\n   high-volume\
    \ portion of the semiconductor industry, where the costs of\n   silicon are dominated\
    \ by the actual fabrication costs.  The\n   customized silicon used in core routers\
    \ is produced in far lower\n   volume, typically in the 1,000-10,000 parts per\
    \ year, whereas\n   microprocessors are running in the tens of millions per year.\
    \  This\n   places the router silicon well off the cost curve, where the\n   economies\
    \ of scale are not directly inherited, and yield improvements\n   are not directly\
    \ inherited from the best current practices.  Thus,\n   router silicon benefits\
    \ from the technological advances made in\n   semiconductors, but does not follow\
    \ Moore's law from a cost\n   perspective.\n   To date, this cost difference has\
    \ not shown clearly.  However, the\n   growth in bandwidth of the Internet and\
    \ the steady climb of the speed\n   of individual links has forced router manufacturers\
    \ to apply more\n   sophisticated silicon technology continuously.  There has\
    \ been a new\n   generation of router hardware that has grown at about 4x the\n\
    \   bandwidth every three years, and increases in routing table size have\n  \
    \ been absorbed by the new generations of hardware.  Now that router\n   hardware\
    \ is nearing the practical limits of per-lambda bandwidth, it\n   is possible\
    \ that upgrades solely for meeting the forwarding table\n   scaling will become\
    \ more visible.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  DRAM
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  DRAM\n   In routers, DRAM is used for storing the RIB and, in lower-end\n\
    \   routers, is also used for storing the FIB.  Historically, DRAM\n   capacity\
    \ grows at about 4x every 3.3 years.  This translates to 2.4x\n   every 2 years,\
    \ so DRAM capacity actually grows faster than Moore's\n   law would suggest. \
    \ DRAM speed, however, only grows about 10% per\n   year, or 1.2x every 2 years\
    \ [DRAM] [Molinero].  This is an issue\n   because BGP convergence time is limited\
    \ by DRAM access speeds.  In\n   processing a BGP update, a BGP speaker receives\
    \ a path and must\n   compare it to all of the other paths it has stored for the\
    \ prefix.\n   It then iterates over all of the prefixes in the update stream.\
    \  This\n   results in a memory access pattern that has proven to limit the\n\
    \   effectiveness of processor caching.  As a result, BGP convergence\n   time\
    \ degrades at the routing table growth rate, divided by the speed\n   improvement\

    \ special-purpose\n   silicon to provide high-speed packet-forwarding capabilities.\
    \  This\n   has been necessary because the architectural limitations of general\n\
    \   purpose CPUs make them incapable of providing the high-bandwidth, low\n  \
    \ latency, low-jitter I/O interface for making high speed forwarding\n   decisions.\n\
    \   As a result, the forwarding engines being built for high-end routers\n   are\
    \ some of the most sophisticated Application-specific Integrated\n   Circuits\

    \ curve.\n   Given that this level of technology is already a requirement to meet\n\
    \   the performance goals, using on-chip SRAM is an interesting design\n   alternative.\
    \  If this choice is selected, then growth in the\n   available FIB is tightly\
    \ coupled to process technology improvements,\n   which are driven by the general-purpose\
    \ CPU market.  While this\n   growth rate should suffice, in general, the forwarding\

    \   a fabricator for manufacturing is known as 'tapeout', and is the\n   point\
    \ where the designer pays for the fixed overhead of putting the\n   chip into\
    \ production.  The costs of taping out a chip have been\n   rising about 1.5x\
    \ every 2 years, driven by new process technology.\n   The actual design and development\
    \ costs have been rising similarly,\n   because each new generation of technology\
    \ increases the device count\n   by roughly a factor of 2.  This allows new features\
    \ and chip\n   architectures, which inevitably lead to an increase in complexity\
    \ and\n   labor costs.  If new chip development was driven solely by the need\n\
    \   to scale up memory, and if memory structures scaled, then we would\n   expect\
    \ labor costs to remain fixed.  Unfortunately, memory structures\n   typically\
    \ do not seem to scale linearly.  Individual memory\n   controllers have a non-negligible\

    \  The net result is that we\n   can expect that chip development costs to continue\
    \ to escalate\n   roughly in line with the increases in tapeout costs, leading\

    \ step roughly doubles memory, that implies that if demand\n   grows faster than\

    \ undue constraints\n   on ISPs.  These proposals were found to be incomplete,\
    \ as they\n   offered no solutions to the new problems they introduced.\n   The\
    \ majority of the proposals fell into the second category--\n   assigning multiple\
    \ address blocks per site.  Because IP addresses\n   have been used as identifiers\
    \ by higher-level protocols and\n   applications, these proposals face a fundamental\
    \ design decision\n   regarding which layer should be responsible for mapping\
    \ the multiple\n   locators (i.e., the multiple addresses received from ISPs)\
    \ to an\n   identifier.  A related question involves which nodes are responsible\n\
    \   for handling multiple addresses.  One can implement a multi-address\n   scheme\
    \ at either each individual host or at edge routers of a site,\n   or even both.\
    \  Handling multiple addresses by edge routers provides\n   the ability to control\
    \ the traffic flow of the entire site.\n   Conversely, handling multiple addresses\
    \ by individual hosts offers\n   each host the flexibility to choose different\
    \ policies for selecting\n   a provider; it also implies changes to all the hosts\
    \ of a multihomed\n   site.\n   During the process of evaluating all the proposals,\
    \ two major lessons\n   were learned:\n   o  Changing anything in the current\
    \ practice is hard: for example,\n      inserting an additional header into the\
    \ protocol would impact IP\n      fragmentation processing, and the current congestion\
    \ control\n      assumes that each TCP connection follows a single routing path.\n\
    \      In addition, operators ask for the ability to perform traffic\n      engineering\
    \ on a per-site basis, and specification of site policy\n      is often interdependent\
    \ with the IP address structure.\n   o  The IP address has been used as an identifier\
    \ and has been\n      codified into many Internet applications that manipulate\
    \ IP\n      addresses directly or include IP addresses within the application\n\
    \      layer data stream.  IP addresses have also been used as\n      identifiers\
    \ in configuring network policies.  Changing the\n      semantics of an IP address,\
    \ for example, using only the last 64-\n      bit as identifiers as proposed by\

  - "6.2.  SHIM6: Pros and Cons\n   The SHIM6 working group took the second approach\
    \ from the MULTI6\n   working group's investigation, i.e., supporting multihoming\
    \ through\n   the use of multiple addresses.  SHIM6 adopted a host-based approach,\n\
    \   where the host IP stack includes a \"shim\" that presents a stable\n   \"\
    upper layer identifier\" (ULID) to the upper layer protocols, but may\n   rewrite\
    \ the IP packets sent and received so that a currently working\n   IP address\
    \ is used in the transmitted packets.  When needed, a SHIM6\n   header is also\
    \ included in the packet itself, to signal to the remote\n   stack.\n   With SHIM6,\
    \ protocols above the IP layer use the ULID to identify\n   endpoints (e.g., for\
    \ TCP connections).  The current design suggests\n   choosing one of the locators\
    \ as the ULID (borrowing a locator to be\n   used as an identifier).  This approach\
    \ makes the implementation\n   compatible with existing IPv6 upper layer protocol\
    \ implementations\n   and applications.  Many of these applications have inherited\
    \ the long\n   time practice of using IP addresses as identifiers.\n   SHIM6 is\
    \ able to isolate upper layer protocols from multiple IP layer\n   addresses.\
    \  This enables a multihomed site to use provider-allocated\n   prefixes, one\
    \ from each of its multiple providers, to facilitate\n   provider-based prefix\
    \ aggregation.  However, this gain comes with\n   several significant costs. \
    \ First, SHIM6 requires modifications to\n   all host stack implementations to\
    \ support the shim processing.\n   Second, the shim layer must maintain the mapping\
    \ between the\n   identifier and the multiple locators returned from IPv6 AAAA\
    \ name\n   resolution, and must take the responsibility to try multiple locators\n\
    \   if failures ever occur during the end-to-end communication.  At this\n   time,\
    \ the host has little information to determine the order of\n   locators it should\
    \ use in reaching a multihomed destination, however,\n   there is ongoing effort\
    \ in addressing this issue.\n   Furthermore, as a host-based approach, SHIM6 provides\
    \ little control\n   to the service provider for effective traffic engineering.\
    \  At the\n   same time, it also imposes additional state information on the host\n\
    \   regarding the multiple locators of the remote communication end.\n   Such\
    \ state information may not be a significant issue for individual\n   user hosts,\
    \ but can lead to larger resource demands on large\n   application servers that\
    \ handle hundreds of thousands of simultaneous\n   TCP connections.\n   Yet another\
    \ major issue with the SHIM6 solution is the need for\n   renumbering when a site\
    \ changes providers.  Although a multihomed\n   site is assigned multiple address\
    \ blocks, none of them can be treated\n   as a persistent identifier for the site.\
    \  When the site changes one\n   of its providers, it must purge the address block\
    \ of that provider\n   from the entire site.  The current practice of using the\
    \ IP address\n   as both an identifier and a locator has been strengthened by\
    \ the use\n   of IP addresses in access control lists present in various types\
    \ of\n   policy-enforcement devices (e.g., firewalls).  If SHIM6's ULIDs are\n\
    \   to be used for policy enforcement, a change of providers may\n   necessitate\
    \ the re-configuration of many such devices.\n"

    \ for scalable multihoming was discussed at the\n   workshop, including the GSE\
    \ [GSE] and indirection approaches, such as\n   Map-and-Encap [RFC1955], in general.\
    \  The GSE proposal changes the\n   IPv6 address structure to bear the semantics\
    \ of both an identifier\n   and a locator.  The first n bytes of the 16-byte IPv6\
    \ address are\n   called the Routing Goop (RG), and are used by the routing system\n\
    \   exclusively as a locator.  The last 8 bytes of the IPv6 address\n   specify\
    \ an interface on an end-system.  The middle (16 - n - 8) bytes\n   are used to\
    \ identify site local topology.  The border routers of a\n   site re-write the\
    \ source RG of each outgoing packet to make the\n   source address part of the\
    \ source provider's address aggregation;\n   they also re-write the destination\
    \ RG of each incoming packet to hide\n   the site's RG from all the internal routers\

    \   popular cryptographically-generated addresses (CGA) remains to be\n   determined\
    \ [dGSE].\n   All identifier/locator split proposals require a mapping service\
    \ that\n   can return a set of locators corresponding to a given identifier. \
    \ In\n   addition, these proposals must also address the problem of detecting\n\
    \   locator failures and redirecting data flows to remaining locators for\n  \
    \ a multihomed site.  The Map-and-Encap proposal did not address these\n   issues.\
    \  GSE proposed to use DNS for providing the mapping service,\n   but it did not\
    \ offer an effective means for locator failure recovery.\n   GSE also requires\

    \ routing scalability is the\n   most important problem facing the Internet today\
    \ and must be solved,\n   although the time frame in which these problems need\
    \ solutions was\n   not directly specified.  The routing scalability problem includes\
    \ the\n   size of the DFZ RIB and FIB, the implications of the growth of the\n\
    \   RIB and FIB on routing convergence times, and the cost, power (and\n   hence,\

    \   It is commonly believed that the IPv4 RIB growth has been constrained\n  \
    \ by the limited IPv4 address space.  However, even under this\n   constraint,\
    \ the DFZ IPv4 RIB has been growing at what appears to be\n   an accelerating\

- title: 7.2.1.  Definition of Locator and Identifier
  contents:
  - "7.2.1.  Definition of Locator and Identifier\n   Roughly speaking, the Internet\
    \ comprises a large number of transit\n   networks and a much larger number of\
    \ customer networks containing\n   hosts that are attached to the backbone.  Viewing\
    \ the Internet as a\n   graph, transit networks have branches and customer networks\
    \ with\n   hosts hang at the edges as leaves.\n   As its name suggests, locators\
    \ identify locations in the topology,\n   and a network's or host's locator should\
    \ be topologically constrained\n   by its present position.  Identifiers, in principle,\
    \ should be\n   network-topology independent.  That is, even though a network\
    \ or host\n   may need to change its locator when it is moved to a different set\
    \ of\n   attachment points in the Internet, its identifier should remain\n   constant.\n\
    \   From an ISP's viewpoint, identifiers identify customer networks and\n   customer\
    \ hosts.  Note that the word \"identifier\" used here is defined\n   in the context\
    \ of the Internet routing system; the definition may\n   well be different when\
    \ the word \"identifier\" is used in other\n   contexts.  As an example, a non-routable,\
    \ provider-independent IP\n   prefix for an enterprise network could serve as\
    \ an identifier for\n   that enterprise.  This block of IP addresses can be used\
    \ to route\n   packets inside the enterprise network.  However, they are independent\n\
    \   from the DFZ topology, which is why they are not globally routable on\n  \
    \ the Internet.\n   Note that in cases such as the last example, the definition\
    \ of\n   locators and identifiers can be context-dependent.  Following the\n \
    \  example further, a PI address may be routable in an enterprise but\n   not\
    \ the global network.  If allowed to be visible in the global\n   network, such\
    \ addresses might act as identifiers from a backbone\n   operator's point of view\
    \ but locators from an enterprise operator's\n   point of view.\n"
- title: 7.2.2.  Consequence of Locator and Identifier Overloading
  contents:
  - "7.2.2.  Consequence of Locator and Identifier Overloading\n   In today's Internet\
    \ architecture, IP addresses have been used as both\n   locators and identifiers.\
    \  Combined with the use of CIDR to perform\n   route aggregation, a problem arises\
    \ for either providers or customers\n   (or both).\n   Consider, for example,\
    \ a campus network C that received prefix\n   x.y.z/24 from provider P1.  When\
    \ C multihomes with a second provider\n   P2, both P1 and P2 must announce x.y.z/24\
    \ so that C can be reached\n   through both providers.  In this example, the prefix\
    \ x.y.z/24 serves\n   both as an identifier for C, as well as a (non-aggregatable)\
    \ locator\n   for C's two attachment points to the transit system.\n   As far\
    \ as the DFZ RIB is concerned, the above example shows that\n   customer multihoming\
    \ blurs the distinction between PA and PI\n   prefixes.  Although C received a\
    \ PA prefix x.y.z/24 from P1, C's\n   multihoming forced this prefix to be announced\
    \ globally (equivalent\n   to a PI prefix), and forced the prefix's original owner,\
    \ provider P1,\n   to de-aggregate.  As a result, today's multihoming practice\
    \ leads to\n   a growth of the routing table size in proportion to the number\
    \ of\n   multihomed customers.  The only practical way to scale a routing\n  \
    \ system today is topological aggregation, which gets destroyed by\n   customer\
    \ multihoming.\n   Although multihoming may blur the PA/PI distinction, there\
    \ exists a\n   big difference between PA and PI prefixes when a customer changes\
    \ its\n   provider(s).  If the customer has used a PA prefix from a former\n \
    \  provider P1, the prefix is supposed to be returned to P1 upon\n   completion\
    \ of the change.  The customer is supposed to get a new\n   prefix from its new\
    \ provider, i.e., renumbering its network.  It is\n   necessary for providers\
    \ to reclaim their PA prefixes from former\n   customers in order to keep the\
    \ topological aggregatiblity of their\n   prefixes.  On the other hand, renumbering\
    \ is considered very painful,\n   if not impossible, by many Internet users, especially\
    \ large\n   enterprise customers.  It is not uncommon for IP addresses in such\n\
    \   enterprises to penetrate deeply into various parts of the networking\n   infrastructure,\
    \ ranging from applications to network management\n   (e.g., policy databases,\
    \ firewall configurations, etc.).  This shows\n   how fragile the system becomes\
    \ due to the overloading of IP addresses\n   as both locators and identifiers;\
    \ significant enterprise operations\n   could be disrupted due to the otherwise\

  - "7.3.1.  Routing Convergence\n   There are two kinds of routing convergence issues,\
    \ eBGP (global\n   routing) convergence and IGP (enterprise or provider) routing\n\
    \   convergence.  Upon isolated topological events, eBGP convergence does\n  \
    \ not suffer from extensive path explorations in most cases [PathExp],\n   and\
    \ convergence delay is largely determined by the minimum route\n   advertisement\
    \ interval (MRAI) timer [RFC4098], except those cases\n   when a route is withdrawn.\
    \  Route withdrawals tend to suffer from\n   path explorations and hence slow\
    \ convergence; one participant's\n   experience suggests that the withdrawal delays\
    \ often last up to a\n   couple of minutes.  One may argue that, if the destination\
    \ becomes\n   unreachable, a long convergence delay would not bring further damage\n\
    \   to applications.  However, there are often cases where a more\n   specific\
    \ route (a longer prefix) has failed, yet the destination can\n   still be reached\
    \ through an aggregated route (a shorter prefix).  In\n   these cases, the long\
    \ convergence delay does impact application\n   performance.\n   While IGPs are\
    \ designed to and do converge more quickly than BGP\n   might, the workshop participants\
    \ were concerned that, in addition to\n   the various special purpose routes that\
    \ IGPs must carry, the rapid\n   growth of the DFZ RIB size can effectively slow\
    \ down IGP convergence.\n   The IGP convergence delay can be due to multiple factors,\
    \ including\n   1.  Delays in detecting physical failures,\n   2.  The delay in\
    \ loading updated information into the FIB, and\n   3.  The large size of the\
    \ internal RIB, often twice as big as the DFZ\n       RIB, which can lead to both\
    \ longer route computation time and\n       longer FIB loading time.\n   The workshop\
    \ participants hold different views regarding (1) the\n   severity of the routing\
    \ convergence problem; and (2) whether it is an\n   architectural problem, or\
    \ an implementation issue.  However, people\n   generally agree that if we solve\
    \ the routing scalability problem,\n   that will certainly help reduce the convergence\
    \ delay or make the\n   problem a much easier one to handle because of the reduced\

    \ the\n   heterogeneity among customers and providers of the global Internet,\n\
    \   and the elasticity of the problem, none of these considerations\n   should\
    \ inherently preclude any specific solution.  Consequently,\n   although the following\
    \ considerations were initially deemed as\n   constraints on solutions, we have\
    \ instead opted to adopt the term\n   'criteria' to be used in guiding solution\
    \ evaluations.\n"
- title: 8.1.  Criteria on Scalability
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Criteria on Scalability\n   Clearly, any proposed solution must solve the\
    \ problem at hand, and\n   our number one problem concerns the scalability of\
    \ the Internet's\n   routing and addressing system(s) as outlined in previous\
    \ sections.\n   Under the assumption of continued growth of the Internet user\n\
    \   population, continued increases of multihoming and RFC 2547 VPN\n   [RFC2547]\
    \ deployment, the solution must enable the routing system to\n   scale gracefully,\
    \ as measured by the number of\n   o  DFZ Internet routes, and\n   o  Internal\
    \ routes.\n   In addition, scalable support for traffic engineering (TE) must\
    \ be\n   considered as a business necessity, not an option.  Capacity planning\n\
    \   involves placing circuits based on traffic demand over a relatively\n   long\
    \ time scale, while TE must work more immediately to match the\n   traffic load\
    \ to the existing capacity and to match the routing policy\n   requirements.\n\
    \   It was recognized that different parties in the Internet may have\n   different\
    \ specific TE requirements.  For example,\n   o  End site TE: based on locally\
    \ determined performance or cost\n      policies, end sites may wish to control\
    \ the traffic volume exiting\n      to, or entering from specific providers.\n\
    \   o  Small ISP to transit ISP TE: operators may face tight resource\n      constraints\
    \ and wish to influence the volume of entering traffic\n      from both customers\
    \ and providers along specific routing paths to\n      best utilize the limited\
    \ resources.\n   o  Large ISP TE: given the densely connected nature of the Internet\n\
    \      topology, a given destination normally can be reached through\n      different\
    \ routing paths.  An operator may wish to be able to\n      adjust the traffic\
    \ volume sent to each of its peers based on\n      business relations with its\
    \ neighbor ASs.\n   At this time, it remains an open issue whether a scalable\
    \ TE solution\n   would be necessarily inside the routing protocol, or can be\n\
    \   accomplished through means that are external to the routing system.\n"
- title: 8.2.  Criteria on Incentives and Economics
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Criteria on Incentives and Economics\n   The workshop attendees concluded\
    \ that one important reason for\n   uncontrolled routing growth was the misalignment\
    \ of incentives.  New\n   entries are added to the routing system to provide benefit\
    \ to\n   specific parties, while the cost is born by everyone in the global\n\
    \   routing system.  The consensus of the workshop was that any proposed\n   solutions\
    \ should strive to provide incentives to reward practices\n   that reduce the\
    \ overall system cost, and punish the \"bad\" behavior\n   that imposes undue\
    \ burden on the global system.\n   Given the global scale and distributed nature\
    \ of the Internet, there\n   can no longer (ever) be a flag day on the Internet.\
    \  To bootstrap the\n   deployment of new solutions, the solutions should provide\
    \ incentives\n   to first movers.  That is, even when a single party starts to\
    \ deploy\n   the new solution, there should be measurable benefits to balance\
    \ the\n   costs.\n   Independent of what kind of solutions the IETF develops,\
    \ if any, it\n   is unlikely that the resulting routing system would stay constant\
    \ in\n   size.  Instead, the workshop participants believed the routing system\n\
    \   will continue to grow, and that ISPs will continue to go through\n   system\
    \ and hardware upgrade cycles.  Many attendees expressed a\n   desire that the\
    \ scaling properties of the system can allow the\n   hardware to keep up with\
    \ the Internet growth at a rate that is\n   comparable to the current costs, for\
    \ example, allowing one to keep a\n   5-year hardware depreciation cycle, as opposed\
    \ to a situation where\n   scaling leads to accelerated cost increases.\n"
- title: 8.3.  Criteria on Timing
  contents:
  - "8.3.  Criteria on Timing\n   Although there does not exist a specific hard deadline,\
    \ the unanimous\n   consensus among the workshop participants is that the solution\n\
    \   development must start now.  If one assumes that the solution\n   specification\
    \ can get ready within a 1 - 2 year time frame, that will\n   be followed by another\
    \ 2-year certification cycle.  As a result, even\n   in the best case scenario,\
    \ we are facing a 3 - 5 year time frame in\n   getting the solutions deployed.\n"
- title: 8.4.  Consideration on Existing Systems
  contents:
  - "8.4.  Consideration on Existing Systems\n   The routing scalability problem is\
    \ a shared one between IPv4 and\n   IPv6, as IPv6 simply inherited IPv4's CIDR-style\
    \ \"Provider-based\n   Addressing\".  The proposed solutions should, and are also\
    \ expected\n   to, solve the problem for both IPv4 and IPv6.\n   Backwards compatibility\
    \ with the existing IPv4 and IPv6 protocol\n   stack is a necessity.  Although\
    \ a wide deployment of IPv6 is yet to\n   happen, there has been substantial investment\
    \ into IPv6\n   implementation and deployment by various parties.  IPv6 is considered\n\
    \   a legacy with shipped code.  Thus, a highly desired feature of any\n   proposed\
    \ solution is to avoid imposing backwards-incompatible changes\n   on end hosts\
    \ (either IPv4 or IPv6).\n   In the routing system itself, the solutions must\
    \ allow incremental\n   changes from the current operational Internet.  The solutions\
    \ should\n   be backward compatible with the routing protocols in use today,\n\
    \   including BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, and others, possibly with incremental\n   enhancements.\n\
    \   The above backward-compatibility considerations should not constrain\n   the\
    \ exploration of the solution space.  We need to first find right\n   solutions,\
    \ and look into their backward-compatibility issues after\n   that.  This way\
    \ enables us to gain a full understanding of the\n   tradeoffs, and what potential\
    \ gains, if any, that we may achieve by\n   relaxing the backward-compatibility\
    \ concerns.\n   As a rule of thumb for successful deployment, for any new design,\
    \ its\n   chance of success is higher if it makes fewer changes to the existing\n\
    \   system.\n"
- title: 8.5.  Consideration on Security
  contents:
  - "8.5.  Consideration on Security\n   Security should be considered from day one\
    \ of solution development.\n   If nothing else, the solutions must not make securing\
    \ the routing\n   system any worse than the situation today.  It is highly desirable\
    \ to\n   have a solution that makes it more difficult to inject false routing\n\
    \   information, and makes it easier to filter out DoS traffic.\n   However, securing\
    \ the routing system is not considered a requirement\n   for the solution development.\
    \  Security is important; having a\n   working system in the first place is even\
    \ more important.\n"
- title: 8.6.  Other Criteria
  contents:
  - "8.6.  Other Criteria\n   A number of other criteria were also raised that fall\
    \ into various\n   different categories.  They are summarized below.\n   o  Site\
    \ renumbering forced by the routing system should be avoided.\n   o  Site reconfiguration\
    \ driven by the routing system should be\n      minimized.\n   o  The solutions\
    \ should not force ISPs to reveal internal topology.\n   o  Routing convergence\
    \ delay must be under control.\n   o  End-to-end data delivery paths should be\
    \ stable enough for good\n      Voice over IP (VoIP) performance.\n"
- title: 8.7.  Understanding the Tradeoff
  contents:
  - "8.7.  Understanding the Tradeoff\n   As the old saying goes, every coin has two\
    \ sides.  If we let the\n   routing table continue to grow at its present rate,\
    \ rapid hardware\n   and software upgrade and replacement cycles for deployed\
    \ core routing\n   equipment may become cost prohibitive.  In the worst case,\
    \ the\n   routing table growth may exceed our ability to engineer the global\n\
    \   routing system in a cost-effective way.  On the other hand, solutions\n  \
    \ for stopping or substantially slowing down the growth in the Internet\n   routing\
    \ table will necessarily bring their own costs, perhaps showing\n   up elsewhere\
    \ and in different forms.  Examples of such tradeoffs are\n   presented in Section\
    \ 6, where we examined the gains and costs of a\n   few different approaches to\
    \ scalable multihoming support (SHIM6, GSE,\n   and a general tunneling approach).\
    \  A major task in the solution\n   development is to understand who may have\
    \ to give up what, and\n   whether that makes a worthy tradeoff.\n   Before ending\
    \ this discussion on the solution criteria, it is worth\n   mentioning the shortest\
    \ presentation at the workshop, which was made\n   by Tony Li (the presentation\
    \ slides can be found from Appendix D).\n   He asked a fundamental question: what\
    \ is at stake?  It is the\n   Internet itself.  If the routing system does not\
    \ scale with the\n   continued growth of the Internet, eventually the costs might\
    \ spiral\n   out of control, the digital divide widen, and the Internet growth\n\
    \   slow down, stop, or retreat.  Compared to this problem, he considered\n  \
    \ that none of the criteria mentioned so far (except solving the\n   problem)\
    \ was important enough to block the development and deployment\n   of an effective\
    \ solution.\n"
- title: 9.  Workshop Recommendations
  contents:
  - "9.  Workshop Recommendations\n   The workshop attendees would like to make the\
    \ following\n   recommendations:\n   First of all, the workshop participants would\
    \ like to reiterate the\n   importance of solving the routing scalability problem.\
    \  They noted\n   that the concern over the scalability and flexibility of the\
    \ routing\n   and addressing system has been with us for a very long time, and\
    \ the\n   current growth rate of the DFZ RIB is exceeding our ability to\n   engineer\
    \ the routing infrastructure in an economically feasible way.\n   We need to start\
    \ developing a long-term solution that can last for\n   the foreseeable future.\n\
    \   Second, because the participants of this workshop consisted of mostly\n  \
    \ large service providers and major router vendors, the workshop\n   participants\
    \ recommend that IAB/IESG organize additional workshops or\n   use other venues\
    \ of communication to reach out to other stakeholders,\n   such as content providers,\
    \ retail providers, and enterprise\n   operators, both to communicate to them\
    \ the outcome of this workshop,\n   and to solicit the routing/addressing problems\
    \ they are facing today,\n   and their requirements on the solution development.\n\
    \   Third, the workshop participants recommend conducting the solution\n   development\
    \ in an open, transparent way, with broad-ranging\n   participation from the larger\
    \ networking community.  A majority of\n   the participants indicated their willingness\
    \ to commit resources\n   toward developing a solution.  We must also invite the\
    \ participation\n   from the research community in this process.  The locator-identifier\n\
    \   split represents a fundamental architectural issue, and the IAB\n   should\
    \ lead the investigation into understanding of both how to make\n   this architectural\
    \ change and the overall impact of the change.\n   Fourth, given the goal of developing\
    \ a long-term solution, and the\n   fact that development and deployment cycles\
    \ will necessarily take\n   some time, it may be helpful (or even necessary) to\
    \ buy some time\n   through engineering feasible short- or intermediate-term solutions\n\
    \   (e.g., FIB compression).\n   Fifth, the workshop participants believe the\
    \ next step is to develop\n   a roadmap from here to the solution deployment.\
    \  The IAB and IESG are\n   expected to take on the leadership role in this roadmap\
    \ development,\n   and to leverage on the momentum from this successful workshop\
    \ to move\n   forward quickly.  The roadmap should provide clearly defined short-,\n\
    \   medium-, and long-term objectives to guide the solution development\n   process,\
    \ so that the community as a whole can proceed in an\n   orchestrated way, seeing\
    \ exactly where we are going when engineering\n   necessary short-term fixes.\n\
    \   Finally, the workshop participants also made a number of suggestions\n   that\
    \ the IETF might consider when examining the solution space.\n   These suggestions\
    \ are captured in Appendix A.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Suggestions for Specific Steps
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Suggestions for Specific Steps\n   At the end of the workshop there\
    \ was a lively round-table discussion\n   regarding specific steps that IETF may\
    \ consider undertaking towards a\n   quick solution development, as well as potential\
    \ issues to avoid.\n   Those steps included:\n   o  Finding a home (mailing list)\
    \ to continue the discussion started\n      from the workshop with wider participation.\
    \  [Editor's note: Done\n      -- This action has been completed.  The list is\
    \ ram@iab.org.]\n   o  Considering a special process to expedite solution development,\n\
    \      avoiding the lengthy protocol standardization cycles.  For\n      example,\
    \ IESG may charter special design teams for the solution\n      investigation.\n\
    \   o  If a working group is to be formed, care must be taken to ensure\n    \
    \  that the scope of the charter is narrow and specific enough to\n      allow\
    \ quick progress, and that the WG chair be forceful enough to\n      keep the\
    \ WG activity focused.  There was also a discussion on\n      which area this\
    \ new WG should belong to; both routing area ADs and\n      Internet area ADs\
    \ are willing to host it.\n   o  It is desirable that the solutions be developed\
    \ in an open\n      environment and free from any Intellectual Property Right\
    \ claims.\n   Finally, given the perceived severity of the problem at hand, the\n\
    \   workshop participants trust that IAB/IESG/IETF will take prompt\n   actions.\
    \  However, if that were not to happen, operators and vendors\n   would be most\
    \ likely to act on their own and get a solution deployed.\n"
