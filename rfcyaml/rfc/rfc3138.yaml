  - "1. Introduction\n   RFC 2770 [RFC2770] describes an experimental policy for use\
    \ of the\n   class D address space using 233/8.  The technique described there\n\
    \   maps 16 bits of Autonomous System number (AS) into the middle two\n   octets\
    \ of 233/8 to yield a /24.  While this technique has been\n   successful, the\
    \ assignments are inefficient in those cases in which a\n   /24 is too small or\
    \ the user doesn't have its own AS.\n   RFC 1930 [RFC1930] defines the private\
    \ AS space to be 64512 through\n   65535.  This memo expands on RFC 2770 to allow\
    \ routing registries to\n   assign multicast addresses from the GLOP space corresponding\
    \ to the\n   RFC 1930 private AS space.  This space will be referred to as the\n\
    \   EGLOP (Extended GLOP) address space.\n   This memo is a product of the Multicast\
    \ Deployment Working Group\n   (MBONED) in the Operations and Management Area\
    \ of the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force.  Submit comments to <mboned@ns.uoregon.edu>\n\
    \   or the authors.\n   The terms \"Specification Required\", \"Expert Review\"\
    , \"IESG Approval\",\n   \"IETF Consensus\", and \"Standards Action\", are used\
    \ in this memo to\n   refer to the processes described in [RFC2434].  The keywords\
    \ MUST,\n   MUST NOT, MAY, OPTIONAL, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,\n\
    \   SHOULD, SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted as defined in RFC 2119\n   [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2. Overview
  contents:
  - "2. Overview\n   http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses defines a\n\
    \   mechanism for assignment of multicast addresses that are generally\n   for\
    \ use in network control applications.  It is envisioned that those\n   addresses\
    \ assigned from the EGLOP space (233.252.0.0 -\n   233.255.255.255) will be used\
    \ by applications that cannot use\n   Administratively Scoped Addressing [RFC2365],\
    \ GLOP Addressing\n   [RFC2770], or Source Specific Multicast (Source Specific\
    \ Multicast,\n   or SSM, is an extension of IP Multicast in which traffic is forwarded\n\
    \   to receivers from only those multicast sources for which the\n   receivers\
    \ have explicitly expressed interest, and is primarily\n   targeted at one-to-many\
    \ (broadcast) applications).\n"
- title: 3. Assignment Criteria
  contents:
  - "3. Assignment Criteria\n   Globally scoped IPv4 multicast addresses in the EGLOP\
    \ space are\n   assigned by a Regional Registry (RIR).  An applicant MUST, as\
    \ per\n   [IANA], show that the request cannot be satisfied using\n   Administratively\
    \ Scoped addressing [RFC2365], GLOP addressing\n   [RFC2770], or SSM.  The fine-grained\
    \ assignment policy is left to the\n   assigning RIR.\n"

    \ source multicast\n   service models.\n"
