Abstract OSPFv3 requires functional extension beyond what can readily be done with the fixed format Link State Advertisement (LSA) as described in RFC 5340.
Without LSA extension, attributes associated with OSPFv3 links and advertised IPv6 prefixes must be advertised in separate LSAs and correlated to the fixed format LSAs.
This document extends the LSA format by encoding the existing OSPFv3 LSA information in Type Length Value (TLV) tuples and allowing advertisement of additional information with additional TLVs.
Backward compatibility mechanisms are also described.
This document updates RFC 5340, "OSPF for IPv6", and RFC 5838, "Support of Address Families in OSPFv3", by providing TLV based encodings for the base OSPFv3 unicast support and OSPFv3 address family support.
Introduction OSPFv3 requires functional extension beyond what can readily be done with the fixed format Link State Advertisement (LSA) as described in RFC 5340 [OSPFV3].
Without LSA extension, attributes associated with OSPFv3 links and advertised IPv6 prefixes must be advertised in separate LSAs and correlated to the fixed format LSAs.
This document extends the LSA format by encoding the existing OSPFv3 LSA information in Type Length Value (TLV) tuples and allowing advertisement of additional information with additional TLVs.
Backward compatibility mechanisms are also described.
This document updates RFC 5340, "OSPF for IPv6", and RFC 5838, "Support of Address Families in OSPFv3", by providing TLV based encodings for the base OSPFv3 support [OSPFV3] and OSPFv3 address family support
A similar extension was previously proposed in support of multi  topology routing.
Additional requirements for the OSPFv3 LSA extension include source/destination routing, route tagging, and others.
A final requirement is to limit the changes to OSPFv3 to those necessary for TLV based LSAs.
For the most part, the semantics of existing OSPFv3 LSAs are retained for their TLV based successor LSAs described herein.
Additionally, encoding details, e.g., the representation of IPv6 prefixes as described in Appendix A.4.1 in RFC 5340 [OSPFV3], have been retained.
This requirement was included to increase the expedience of IETF adoption and deployment.
The following aspects of the OSPFv3 LSA extension are described: 1.  Extended LSA Types 2.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
The TLV based OSPFv3 LSAs described in this document will be referred to as Extended LSAs.
The OSPFv3 fixed format LSAs [OSPFV3] will be referred to as Legacy LSAs.
In order to provide backward compatibility, new LSA codes must be allocated.
There are eight fixed format LSAs defined in RFC 5340 [OSPFV3].
For ease of implementation and debugging, the LSA function codes are the same as the fixed format LSAs only with 32, i.e., 0x20, added.
The alternative to this mapping was to allocate a bit in the LS Type indicating the new LSA format.
However, this would have used one half the LSA function code space for the migration of the eight original fixed format LSAs.
For backward compatibility, the U bit MUST be set in the LS Type so that the LSAs will be flooded by OSPFv3 routers that do not understand them.
LSA function code   LS Type   Description
E Inter Area Router LSA 37
The format of the TLVs within the body of the Extended LSAs is the same as the format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF [TE].
The variable TLV section consists of one or more nested TLV tuples.
Nested TLVs are also referred to as sub TLVs.
The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets (thus, a TLV with no value portion would have a length of 0).
The TLV is padded to 4 octet alignment; padding is not included in the Length field (so a 3 octet value would have a length of 3, but the total size of the TLV would be 8 octets).
Nested TLVs are also 32 bit aligned.
For example, a 1 byte value would have the Length field set to 1, and
3 octets of padding would be added to the end of the value portion of the TLV.
This document defines the following top level TLV types:  0
TLV  2 Attached Routers TLV
3 Inter Area Prefix TLV
TLV  5 External Prefix TLV  6 Intra Area Prefix
7 IPv6 Link Local Address
8 IPv4 Link Local Address TLV Additionally, this document defines the following sub TLV types:
0 Reserved  1 IPv6 Forwarding Address sub TLV  2 IPv4 Forwarding Address
TLV  3 Route Tag sub TLV
In general, TLVs and sub TLVs MAY occur in any order, and the specification should define whether the TLV or sub TLV is required and the behavior when there are multiple occurrences of the TLV or sub TLV.
While this document only describes the usage of TLVs and sub TLVs, sub TLVs may be nested to any level as long as the sub TLVs are fully specified in the specification for the subsuming sub TLV.
For backward compatibility, an LSA is not considered malformed from a TLV perspective unless either a required TLV is missing or a specified TLV is less than the minimum required length.
Refer to Section 6.3 for more information on TLV backward compatibility.
The prefix options are extended from Appendix A.4.1.1 [OSPFV3].
The applicability of the LA bit is expanded, and it SHOULD be set in Inter Area Prefix TLVs and MAY be set in External Prefix TLVs when the advertised host IPv6 address, i.e.,
PrefixLength   128 for the IPv6 Address Family or PrefixLength   32 for the IPv4 Address Family [OSPFV3 AF], is an interface address.
In RFC 5340, the LA bit is only set in Intra Area Prefix LSAs
This will allow a stable address to be advertised without having to configure a separate loopback address in every OSPFv3 area.
Additionally, the N bit prefix option is defined.
The figure below shows the position of the N bit in the prefix options (value 0x20).
The N bit is set in PrefixOptions for a host address (PrefixLength 128 for the IPv6 Address Family or PrefixLength 32 for the IPv4 Address Family [OSPFV3 AF])
that identifies the advertising router.
While it is similar to the LA bit, there are two differences.
The advertising router MAY choose NOT to set the N bit even when the above conditions are met.
If the N bit is set and the PrefixLength is NOT 128 for the IPv6 Address Family or 32 for the IPv4 Address Family [OSPFV3 AF], the N bit MUST be ignored.
Additionally, the N bit is propagated in the PrefixOptions when an OSPFv3 Area Border Router (ABR) originates an Inter Area Prefix LSA for an Intra Area route that has the N bit set in the PrefixOptions.
Similarly, the N bit is propagated in the PrefixOptions when an OSPFv3
Not So Stubby Area (NSSA)
ABR originates an E AS External LSA corresponding to an NSSA route as described in Section 3 of RFC 3101 [NSSA].
The N bit is added to the Inter Area Prefix TLV (Section 3.4), External Prefix TLV (Section 3.6), and Intra Area Prefix TLV (Section 3.7).
The N bit is used as hint to identify the preferred address to reach the advertising OSPFv3 router.
This would be in contrast to an anycast address [IPV6 ADDRESS ARCH], which could also be a local address with the LA bit set.
It is useful for applications such as identifying the prefixes corresponding to Node Segment Identifiers (SIDs) in Segment Routing [SEGMENT ROUTING].
There may be future applications requiring selection of a prefix associated with an OSPFv3 router.
The Router Link TLV defines a single router link, and the field definitions correspond directly to links in the OSPFv3 Router LSA; see Appendix A.4.3 of [OSPFV3].
The Router Link TLV is only applicable to the E Router LSA (Section 4.1).
Inclusion in other Extended LSAs MUST be ignored. 0
TLV defines all the routers attached to an OSPFv3 multi access network.
The field definitions correspond directly to content of the OSPFv3 Network LSA; see Appendix A.4.4 of [OSPFV3].
The Attached Routers TLV is only applicable to the E Network LSA (Section 4.2).
Inclusion in other Extended LSAs MUST be ignored. 0
There are two reasons for not having a separate TLV or sub TLV for each adjacent neighbor.
The first is to discourage using the E Network LSA for more than its current role of solely advertising the routers attached to a multi access network.
The router's metric as well as the attributes of individual attached routers should be advertised in their respective E Router LSAs.
The second reason is that there is only a single E Network LSA per multi access link with the Link State ID
set to the Designated Router's Interface ID, and consequently, compact encoding has been chosen to decrease the likelihood that the size of the E Network LSA will require IPv6 fragmentation when advertised in an OSPFv3 Link State Update packet.
The Inter Area Prefix TLV defines a single OSPFV3 inter area prefix.
The field definitions correspond directly to the content of an OSPFv3 IPv6 Prefix, as defined in Appendix A.4.1 of [OSPFV3], and an OSPFv3 Inter Area Prefix LSA, as defined in Appendix A.4.5 of [OSPFV3].
Additionally, the PrefixOptions are extended as described in Section 3.1.
The Inter Area Prefix TLV is only applicable to the E Inter Area Prefix LSA (Section 4.3).
Inclusion in other Extended LSAs MUST be ignored. 0
Inter Area Prefix TLV 3.5.
The Inter Area Router TLV defines a single OSPFv3 Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR) that is reachable in another area.
The field definitions correspond directly to the content of an OSPFv3 Inter Area Router LSA, as defined in Appendix A.4.6 of [OSPFV3].
The Inter Area Router TLV is only applicable to the E Inter Area Router LSA (Section 4.4).
Inclusion in other Extended LSAs MUST be ignored. 0
Inter Area Router TLV 3.6.
The External Prefix TLV defines a single OSPFv3 external prefix.
With the exception of omitted fields noted below, the field definitions correspond directly to the content of an OSPFv3 IPv6 Prefix, as defined in Appendix A.4.1 of [OSPFV3], and an OSPFv3 AS External LSA, as defined in Appendix A.4.7 of [OSPFV3].
The External Prefix TLV is only applicable to the E AS External LSA (Section 4.5) and the E NSSA LSA (Section 4.6).
Additionally, the PrefixOptions are extended as described in Section 3.1.
Inclusion in other Extended LSAs MUST be ignored. 0
In the External Prefix TLV, the optional IPv6/IPv4 Forwarding Address and External Route Tag are now sub TLVs.
Given the Referenced LS Type and Referenced Link State ID from the AS External LSA have never been used or even specified, they have been omitted from the External Prefix TLV.
If there were ever a requirement for a referenced LSA, it could be satisfied with a sub TLV.
The following sub TLVs are defined for optional inclusion in the External Prefix TLV:
1 IPv6 Forwarding Address sub TLV (Section 3.10)
2 IPv4 Forwarding Address sub TLV (Section 3.11)
3 Route Tag sub TLV (Section 3.12) 3.7.
The Intra Area Prefix TLV defines a single OSPFv3 intra area prefix.
The field definitions correspond directly to the content of an OSPFv3 IPv6 Prefix, as defined in Appendix A.4.1 of [OSPFV3], and an OSPFv3 Link LSA, as defined in Appendix A.4.9 of [OSPFV3].
The Intra Area Prefix TLV is only applicable to the E Link LSA (Section 4.7) and the E Intra Area Prefix LSA (Section 4.8).
Additionally, the PrefixOptions are extended as described in Section 3.1.
Inclusion in other Extended LSAs MUST be ignored. 0
Intra Area Prefix TLV 3.8.
The IPv6 Link Local Address TLV is to be used with IPv6 address families as defined in [OSPFV3 AF].
The IPv6 Link Local Address TLV is only applicable to the E Link LSA (Section 4.7).
Inclusion in other Extended LSAs MUST be ignored. 0
The IPv4 Link Local Address TLV is to be used with IPv4 address families as defined in [OSPFV3 AF].
The IPv4 Link Local Address TLV is only applicable to the E Link LSA (Section 4.7).
Inclusion in other Extended LSAs MUST be ignored. 0
Link Local Address TLV 3.10.
Forwarding Address TLV has identical semantics to the optional forwarding address in Appendix A.4.7 of [OSPFV3].
Forwarding Address TLV is applicable to the External Prefix TLV (Section 3.6).
Specification as a sub TLV of other TLVs is not defined herein.
The sub TLV is optional and the first specified instance is used as the forwarding address as defined in [OSPFV3].
Instances subsequent to the first MUST be ignored.
The IPv6 Forwarding Address TLV is to be used with IPv6 address families as defined in [OSPFV3 AF].
It MUST be ignored for other address families.
Forwarding Address TLV has identical semantics to the optional forwarding address in Appendix A.4.7 of [OSPFV3].
Forwarding Address TLV is applicable to the External Prefix TLV (Section 3.6).
Specification as a sub TLV of other TLVs is not defined herein.
The sub TLV is optional, and the first specified instance is used as the forwarding address as defined in [OSPFV3].
Instances subsequent to the first MUST be ignored.
The IPv4 Forwarding Address TLV is to be used with IPv4 address families as defined in [OSPFV3 AF].
It MUST be ignored for other address families.
The optional Route Tag sub TLV
has identical semantics to the optional External Route Tag in Appendix A.4.7 of [OSPFV3].
TLV is applicable to the External Prefix TLV (Section 3.6).
Specification as a sub TLV of other TLVs is not defined herein.
The sub TLV is optional, and the first specified instance is used as the Route Tag as defined in [OSPFV3].
Instances subsequent to the first MUST be ignored.
This section specifies the OSPFv3 Extended LSA formats and encoding.
The Extended OSPFv3 LSAs corresponded directly to the original OSPFv3 LSAs specified in [OSPFV3].
The E Router LSA has an LS Type of 0xA021 and has the same base information content as the Router LSA defined in Appendix A.4.3 of [OSPFV3].
However, unlike the existing Router LSA, it is fully extensible and represented as TLVs. 0
4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
Extended Router LSA Other than having a different LS Type, all LSA Header fields are the same as defined for the Router LSA.
Initially, only the top level Router Link TLV (Section 3.2) is applicable, and an E Router LSA may include multiple Router Link TLVs.
Like the existing Router LSA, the LSA length is used to determine the end of the LSA including any TLVs.
Depending on the implementation, it is perfectly valid for an E Router LSA to not contain any Router Link TLVs.
However, this would imply that the OSPFv3 router doesn't have any adjacencies in the corresponding area and is forming an adjacency or adjacencies over an unnumbered link(s).
Note that no E Router LSA stub link is advertised for an unnumbered link.
The E Network LSA has an LS Type of 0xA022 and has the same base information content as the Network LSA defined in Appendix A.4.4 of [OSPFV3].
However, unlike the existing Network LSA, it is fully extensible and represented as TLVs. 0
Like the existing Network LSA, the LSA length is used to determine the end of the LSA including any TLVs.
Initially, only the top level Attached Routers TLV (Section 3.3)
If the Attached Router TLV is not included in the E Network LSA, it is treated as malformed as described in Section 5.
Instances of the Attached Router TLV subsequent to the first MUST be ignored.
E Inter Area Prefix LSA
The E Inter Area Prefix LSA has an LS Type of 0xA023 and has the same base information content as the Inter Area Prefix LSA defined in Appendix A.4.5 of [OSPFV3].
However, unlike the existing Inter Area Prefix LSA, it is fully extensible and represented as TLVs. 0
E Inter Area Prefix LSA Other than having a different LS Type, all LSA Header fields are the same as defined for the Inter Area Prefix LSA.
In order to retain compatibility and semantics with the current OSPFv3 specification, each Inter Area Prefix LSA MUST contain a single Inter Area Prefix TLV.
This will facilitate migration and avoid changes to functions such as incremental Shortest Path First (SPF) computation.
Like the existing Inter Area Prefix LSA, the LSA length is used to determine the end of the LSA including any TLVs.
Initially, only the top level Inter Area Prefix TLV (Section 3.4) is applicable.
If the Inter Area Prefix TLV is not included in the E Inter Area Prefix LSA, it is treated as malformed as described in Section 5.
Instances of the Inter Area Prefix TLV subsequent to the first MUST be ignored.
E Inter Area Router LSA
The E Inter Area Router LSA has an LS Type of 0xA024 and has the same base information content as the Inter Area Router LSA defined in Appendix A.4.6 of [OSPFV3].
However, unlike the Inter Area Router LSA, it is fully extensible and represented as TLVs. 0
In order to retain compatibility and semantics with the current OSPFv3 specification, each Inter Area Router LSA MUST contain a single Inter Area Router TLV.
This will facilitate migration and avoid changes to functions such as incremental SPF computation.
Like the existing Inter Area Router LSA, the LSA length is used to determine the end of the LSA including any TLVs.
Initially, only the top level Inter Area Router TLV (Section 3.5) is applicable.
If the Inter Area Router TLV is not included in the E Inter Area Router LSA, it is treated as malformed as described in Section 5.
Instances of the Inter Area Router TLV subsequent to the first MUST be ignored.
The E AS External LSA has an LS Type of 0xC025 and has the same base information content as the AS External LSA defined in Appendix A.4.7 of [OSPFV3].
However, unlike the existing AS External LSA, it is fully extensible and represented as TLVs. 0
In order to retain compatibility and semantics with the current OSPFv3 specification, each LSA MUST contain a single External Prefix TLV.
This will facilitate migration and avoid changes to OSPFv3 functions such as incremental SPF computation.
Like the existing AS External LSA, the LSA length is used to determine the end of the LSA including any TLVs.
Initially, only the top level External Prefix TLV (Section 3.6) is applicable.
If the External Prefix TLV is not included in the E External AS LSA, it is treated as malformed as described in Section 5.
Instances of the External Prefix TLV subsequent to the first MUST be ignored.
The E NSSA LSA will have the same format and TLVs as the Extended AS External LSA (Section 4.5).
This is the same relationship that exists between the NSSA LSA, as defined in Appendix A.4.8 of [OSPFV3], and the AS External LSA.
The NSSA LSA will have type 0xA027, which implies area flooding scope.
Future requirements may dictate that supported TLVs differ between the E AS External LSA and the E NSSA LSA.
However, future requirements are beyond the scope of this document.
The E Link LSA has an LS Type of 0x8028 and will have the same base information content as the Link LSA defined in Appendix A.4.9 of [OSPFV3].
However, unlike the existing Link LSA, it is fully extensible and represented as TLVs. 0
Only the Intra Area Prefix TLV (Section 3.7), IPv6 Link Local Address TLV (Section 3.8), and IPv4 Link Local Address TLV (Section 3.9) are applicable to the E Link LSA.
Like the Link LSA, the E Link LSA affords advertisement of multiple intra area prefixes.
Hence, multiple Intra Area Prefix TLVs (Section 3.7) may be specified, and the LSA length defines the end of the LSA including any TLVs.
A single instance of the IPv6 Link Local Address TLV (Section 3.8) SHOULD be included in the E Link LSA.
Instances following the first MUST be ignored.
For IPv4 address families as defined in [OSPFV3 AF], this TLV MUST be ignored.
Similarly, only a single instance of the IPv4 Link Local Address TLV (Section 3.9) SHOULD be included in the E Link LSA.
Instances following the first MUST be ignored.
For OSPFv3 IPv6 address families as defined in [OSPFV3 AF], this TLV SHOULD be ignored.
If the IPv4/IPv6 Link Local Address TLV corresponding to the OSPFv3 Address Family is not included in the E Link LSA, it is treated as malformed as described in Section 5.
Future specifications may support advertisement of routing and topology information for multiple address families.
However, this is beyond the scope of this document.
E Intra Area Prefix LSA
The E Intra Area Prefix LSA has an LS Type of 0xA029 and has the same base information content as the Intra Area Prefix LSA defined in Appendix A.4.10 of [OSPFV3] except for the Referenced LS Type.
However, unlike the Intra Area Prefix LSA, it is fully extensible and represented as TLVs.
The Referenced LS Type MUST be either an E Router LSA (0xA021) or an E Network LSA (0xA022). 0
Like the Intra Area Prefix LSA, the E Intra Area Link LSA affords advertisement of multiple intra area prefixes.
Hence, multiple Intra Area Prefix TLVs may be specified, and the LSA length defines the end of the LSA including any TLVs.
Malformed OSPFv3 Extended LSA Handling Extended LSAs that have inconsistent length or other encoding errors, as described herein, MUST NOT be installed in the Link State Database, acknowledged, or flooded.
Reception of malformed LSAs SHOULD be counted and/or logged for examination by the administrator of the OSPFv3 routing domain.
Note that for the purposes of length validation, a TLV or sub TLV should not be considered invalid unless the length exceeds the length of the LSA or does not meet the minimum length requirements for the TLV or sub TLV.
This allows for sub TLVs to be added as described in Section 6.3.
Additionally, an LSA MUST be considered malformed if it does not include all of the required TLVs and sub TLVs.
In the context of this document, backward compatibility is solely related to the capability of an OSPFv3 router to receive, process, and originate the TLV based LSAs defined herein.
Unrecognized TLVs and sub TLVs are ignored.
Backward compatibility for future OSPFv3 extensions utilizing the TLV based LSAs is out of scope and must be covered in the documents describing those extensions.
Both full and, if applicable, partial deployment SHOULD be specified for future TLV  based OSPFv3 LSA extensions.
If ExtendedLSASupport is enabled (Appendix A), OSPFv3 Extended LSAs will be originated and used for the SPF computation.
Individual OSPF Areas can be migrated separately with the Legacy AS External LSAs being originated and used for the SPF computation.
This is accomplished by enabling AreaExtendedLSASupport (Appendix B).
An OSPFv3 routing domain or area may be non disruptively migrated using separate OSPFv3 instances for the Extended LSAs.
Initially, the OSPFv3 instances with ExtendedLSASupport will have a lower preference, i.e., higher administrative distance, than the OSPFv3 instances originating and using the Legacy LSAs.
Once the routing domain or area is fully migrated and the OSPFv3 Routing Information Bases (RIBs) have been verified, the OSPFv3 instances using the Extended LSAs can be given preference.
When this has been completed and the routing within the OSPF routing domain or area has been verified, the original OSPFv3 instance using Legacy LSAs can be removed.
In this mode, OSPFv3 will use the Legacy LSAs for the SPF computation and will only originate Extended LSAs when LSA origination is required in support of additional functionality.
Furthermore, those Extended LSAs will only include the top level TLVs (e.g., Router Link TLVs or Inter Area TLVs), which are required for that new functionality.
However, if a top level TLV is advertised, it MUST include required sub TLVs, or it will be considered malformed as described in Section 5.
Hence, this mode of compatibility is known as "sparse mode".
The advantage of sparse mode is that functionality utilizing the OSPFv3 Extended LSAs can be added to an existing OSPFv3 routing domain without the requirement for migration.
In essence, this compatibility mode is very much like the approach taken for OSPFv2 [OSPF PREFIX LINK].
As with all the compatibility modes, backward compatibility for the functions utilizing the Extended LSAs must be described in the IETF documents describing those functions.
LSA TLV Processing Backward Compatibility
This section defines the general rules for processing LSA TLVs.
To ensure compatibility of future TLV based LSA extensions, all implementations MUST adhere to these rules: 1.
Unrecognized TLVs and sub TLVs are ignored when parsing or processing Extended LSAs.
Whether or not partial deployment of a given TLV is supported MUST be specified.
If partial deployment is not supported, mechanisms to ensure the corresponding feature is not deployed MUST be specified in the document defining the new TLV or sub TLV.
If partial deployment is supported, backward compatibility and partial deployment MUST be specified in the document defining the new TLV or sub TLV.
If a TLV or sub TLV is recognized but the length is less than the minimum, then the LSA should be considered malformed, and it SHOULD NOT be acknowledged.
Additionally, the occurrence SHOULD be logged with enough information to identify the LSA by type, Link State ID, originator, and sequence number and identify the TLV or sub TLV in error.
Ideally, the log entry would include the hexadecimal or binary representation of the LSA including the malformed TLV or sub TLV.
Documents specifying future TLVs or Sub TLVs MUST specify the requirements for usage of those TLVs or sub TLVs.
Future TLVs or sub TLVs must be optional.
However, there may be requirements for sub TLVs if an optional TLV is specified.
In general, extensible OSPFv3 LSAs are subject to the same security concerns as those described in RFC 5340 [OSPFV3].
Additionally, implementations must assure that malformed TLV and sub TLV permutations do not result in errors that cause hard OSPFv3 failures.
If there were ever a requirement to digitally sign OSPFv3 LSAs as described for OSPFv2 LSAs in RFC 2154 [OSPF DIGITAL SIGNATURE], the mechanisms described herein would greatly simplify the extension.
This specification defines nine OSPFv3 Extended LSA types as described in Section 2.
These have been added to the existing OSPFv3 LSA Function Codes registry.
The specification defines a code point for the N bit in the OSPFv3 Prefix Options registry.
The value 0x20 has been assigned.
This specification also creates two registries for OSPFv3 Extended LSA TLVs and sub TLVs.
The TLV and sub TLV code points in these registries are common to all Extended LSAs, and their respective definitions must define where they are applicable.
The "OSPFv3 Extended LSA TLVs" registry defines top level TLVs for Extended LSAs and has been placed in the existing OSPFv3 IANA registry.
Nine values have been allocated:  0
TLV  2 Attached Routers TLV
3 Inter Area Prefix TLV
TLV  5 External Prefix TLV  6 Intra Area Prefix
7 IPv6 Link Local Address
TLV  8 IPv4 Link Local Address TLV Types in the range 9 32767 are allocated via IETF Review or IESG Approval [RFC8126].
Types in the range 32768 33023 are Reserved for Experimental Use; these will not be registered with IANA and MUST NOT be mentioned by RFCs.
Types in the range 33024 45055 are to be assigned on a First Come First Served (FCFS) basis.
Types in the range 45056 65535 are not to be assigned at this time.
Before any assignments can be made in the 33024 65535 range, there MUST be an IETF specification that specifies IANA Considerations that cover the range being assigned.
Extended LSA Sub TLV Registry
The "OSPFv3 Extended LSA Sub TLVs" registry defines sub TLVs at any level of nesting for Extended LSAs and has been placed in the existing OSPFv3 IANA registry.
Four values have been allocated:  0 Reserved  1 IPv6 Forwarding Address sub
TLV  2 IPv4 Forwarding Address sub
TLV  3 Route Tag sub
TLV Types in the range 4 32767 are allocated via IETF Review or IESG Approval.
Types in the range 32768 33023 are Reserved for Experimental Use; these will not be registered with IANA and MUST NOT be mentioned by RFCs.
Types in the range 33024 45055 are to be assigned on an FCFS basis.
Types in the range 45056 65535 are not to be assigned at this time.
Before any assignments can be made in the 33024 65535 range, there MUST be an IETF specification that specifies IANA Considerations that cover the range being assigned.
Appendix A.  Global Configuration Parameters
The global configurable parameter ExtendedLSASupport is added to the OSPFv3 protocol.
If ExtendedLSASupport is enabled, the OSPFv3 router will originate OSPFv3 Extended LSAs and use the LSAs for the SPF computation.
If ExtendedLSASupport is not enabled, a subset of OSPFv3 Extended LSAs may still be originated and used for other functions as described in Section 6.2.
Appendix B.  Area Configuration Parameters
The area configurable parameter AreaExtendedLSASupport is added to the OSPFv3 protocol.
If AreaExtendedLSASupport is enabled, the OSPFv3 router will originate link and area OSPFv3 Extended LSAs and use the LSAs for the SPF computation.
AS Scoped LSAs will still be originated and used for the AS External LSA computation.
If AreaExtendedLSASupport is not enabled, a subset of OSPFv3 link and area Extended LSAs may still be originated and used for other functions as described in Section 6.2.
For regular areas, i.e., areas where AS scoped LSAs are flooded, disabling AreaExtendedLSASupport for a regular OSPFv3 area (not a Stub or NSSA area) when ExtendedLSASupport is enabled is contradictory and SHOULD be prohibited by implementations.
