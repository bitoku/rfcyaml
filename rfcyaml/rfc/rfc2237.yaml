  - "1. Abstract\n   This memo defines an encoding scheme for the Japanese Characters,\n\
    \   describes \"ISO-2022-JP-1\", which is used in electronic mail [RFC-\n   822],\
    \ and network news [RFC 1036]. Also this memo provides a listing\n   of the Japanese\
    \ Character Set that can be used in this encoding\n   scheme.\n"

- title: 3. Introduction
  contents:
  - "3. Introduction\n   RFC 1468 defines the way Japanese Characters are encoded,\
    \ likewise\n   what this memo defines. It defines the use of JIS X 0208 as the\n\
    \   double-byte character set in ISO-2022-JP text.\n   Today, many operating systems\
    \ support proprietary extended Japanese\n   characters or JIS X 0212, This includes\
    \ the Unicode character set,\n   which does not conform to JIS X 0201 nor JIS\
    \ X 0208. Therefore, this\n   limits the ability to communicate and correspond\
    \ precise information\n   because of the limited availability of Kanji characters.\
    \ Fortunately\n   JIS (Japanese Industry Standard) defines JIS X 0212 as \"code\
    \ of the\n   supplementary Japanese graphic character set for information\n  \
    \ interchange\". Most Japanese characters which are used in regular\n   electronic\
    \ mail in most cases can be accommodated in JIS X 0201, JIS\n   X 0208 and JIS\
    \ X 0212.\n   Also it is recognized that there is a tendency to use Unicode,\n\
    \   however, Unicode is not yet widely used and there is a certain\n   limitation\
    \ with old electronic mail system. Furthermore, the purpose\n   of this comment\
    \ is to add the capability of writing out JIS X 0212.\n   This comment does not\
    \ describe any representation of iso-2022-jp-1\n   version information in addition\
    \ to JIS X 0212 support.\n"

  contents:
  - "4. Description\n   In \"ISO-2022-JP-1\" text, the initial character code of the\
    \ message is\n   in ASCII. The \"double-byte-seq\"(see \"Format Syntax\" section)\
    \ (ESC \"$\"\n   \"B\" / ESC \"$\" \"@\" / ESC \"$\" \"(\" \"D\") is the only\
    \ designator that\n   indicates that the following character is double-byte, and\
    \ it is\n   valid until another escape sequence appears.  It is very discouraged\n\
    \   to use (ESC \"$\" \"@\") for double byte character encoding, new\n   implementation\
    \ SHOULD use only (ESC \"$\" \"B\") for double byte encoding\n   instead.\n  \
    \ The end of \"ISO-2022-JP-1\" text MUST be in ASCII. Also it is strongly\n  \
    \ recommended to back up to the ASCII at the end of each line rather\n   than\
    \ JIS X 0201-Roman if there is any none ASCII character in middle\n   of a line.\n\
    \   Since \"ISO-2022-JP-1\" is designed to add the capability of writing\n   out\
    \ JIS X 0212, if the message does not contain none of JIS X 0212\n   characters.\
    \ \"ISO-2022-JP\" text MUST BE used.\n   JIS X 0201-Roman is not identical to\
    \ the ASCII with two different\n   characters.\n   The following list are the\
    \ escape sequences and character sets that\n   can be used in \"ISO-2022-JP-1\"\
    \ text. The registered number in the ISO\n   2375 Register which allow double-byte\
    \ ideographic scripts to be\n   encoded within ISO/IEC 2022 code structure is\
    \ indicated as reg#\n   below.\n   reg# character set     ESC sequence       \

  - "7. MIME Considerations\n   The name to be used for the Japanese encoding scheme\
    \ in content is\n   \"ISO-2022-JP-1\". When this name is used in the MIME message\
    \ form, it\n   would be:\n              Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-2022-jp-1\n\
    \   Since the \"ISO-2022-JP-1\" is 7bit encoding, it will be unnecessary to\n\
    \   encode in another format by specifying the \"Content-Transfer-\n   Encoding\"\
    \ header. Also applying Based64 or Quoted-Printable encoding\n   MAY cause today's\
    \ software to fail to decode the message.\n   \"ISO-2022-JP-1\" can be used in\
    \ MIME headers. Also \"ISO-2022-JP-1\"\n   text can be used with Base64 or Quoted-Printable\
    \ encoding.\n"
- title: 8. Additional Information
  contents:
  - "8. Additional Information\n   As long as mail systems are capable of writing\
    \ out Unicode, it is\n   recommended to also write out Unicode text in addition\
    \ to \"ISO-\n   2022-JP-1\" text. Also writing out \"ISO-2022-JP\" text in addition\
    \ to\n   \"ISO-2022-JP-1\" is strongly encouraged for backward compatibility\n\
    \   reasons.\n   Some mail systems write out 8bits characters in 'parameter' and\n\
    \   'value' defined in [RFC 822] and [RFC 1521]. All 8bit characters MUST\n  \
    \ NOT be used in those fields. The implementation of future mail\n   systems SHOULD\
    \ support those only for interoperability reasons.\n"
