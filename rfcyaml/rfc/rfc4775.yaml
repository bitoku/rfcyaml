  - "1.  Introduction\n   BCP 9 [RFC2026] is the current definition of the IETF standards\n\
    \   track.  This process applies not only to the initial definition of a\n   protocol,\
    \ but also to any subsequent updates, such that continued\n   interoperability\
    \ can be guaranteed.  However, it is not always clear\n   whether extensions to\
    \ a protocol should be made within the IETF\n   process, especially when they\
    \ originate outside the IETF community.\n   This document lays down guidelines\
    \ and procedures for such\n   extensions.\n   When developing protocols, IETF\
    \ Working Groups (WGs) typically\n   include mechanisms whereby these protocols\
    \ can be extended in the\n   future.  It is, of course, a good principle to design\
    \ extensibility\n   into protocols; a common definition of a successful protocol\
    \ is one\n   that becomes widely used in ways not originally anticipated.  Well-\n\
    \   designed extensibility mechanisms facilitate the evolution of\n   protocols\
    \ and help make it easier to roll out incremental changes in\n   an interoperable\
    \ fashion.  At the same time, experience has shown\n   that extensibility features\
    \ should be limited to what is clearly\n   necessary when the protocol is developed,\
    \ and any later extensions\n   should be done carefully and with a full understanding\
    \ of the base\n   protocol, existing implementations, and current operational\
    \ practice.\n   However, it is not the purpose of this document to describe the\n\
    \   architectural principles of sound extensibility design.\n   When extensions\
    \ to IETF protocols are made within the IETF, the\n   normal IETF process is followed,\
    \ including the normal processes for\n   IETF-wide review and IESG approval. \
    \ Extensions developed in this way\n   should respect the same architectural principles\
    \ and technical\n   criteria as any other IETF work.\n   In addition to the IETF\
    \ itself, other Standards Development\n   Organizations (SDOs), vendors, and technology\
    \ fora may identify a\n   requirement for an extension to an IETF protocol.  The\
    \ question\n   addressed by this document is how such bodies should proceed. \
    \ There\n   are several possible scenarios:\n   1.  The requirement is straightforward\
    \ and within the scope of\n       whatever extension mechanism the base protocol\
    \ includes.\n   2.  The requirement is, or may be, outside that scope, and:\n\
    \       1.  The IETF still has an active WG in the area;\n       2.  The IETF\
    \ has no active WG, but has relevant expertise;\n       3.  The IETF no longer\
    \ has a nucleus of relevant expertise.\n   Especially in the latter three cases,\
    \ there are technical risks in\n   extension design, described in the next section.\
    \  These risks are\n   higher when extensions to IETF protocols are made outside\
    \ the IETF\n   and without consulting the IETF.\n   This document is focused on\
    \ appropriate procedures and practices to\n   minimize the chance that extensions\
    \ developed outside the IETF will\n   encounter these risks and, therefore, become\
    \ useless or, worse,\n   damaging to interoperability.  Architectural considerations\
    \ are\n   documented elsewhere.  This document is directed principally at other\n\
    \   SDOs and vendors considering requirements for extensions to IETF\n   protocols.\
    \  It does not modify formal IETF processes.\n   The IETF claims no special position.\
    \  Everything said here about IETF\n   protocols would apply with equal force\
    \ to protocols specified by any\n   SDO.  The IETF should follow whatever procedures\
    \ another SDO lays\n   down for extensions to its own protocols, if the IETF identifies\
    \ a\n   need for such an extension.\n"
- title: 2.  Technical Risks in Extensions
  contents:
  - "2.  Technical Risks in Extensions\n   Extensions may be developed without full\
    \ understanding of why the\n   existing protocol was designed the way that it\
    \ is -- e.g., what ideas\n   were brought up during the original development and\
    \ rejected because\n   of some problem with them.  Also, extensions could unintentionally\n\
    \   negate some key function of the existing protocol (such as security\n   or\
    \ congestion control).  Design choices can be made without analyzing\n   their\
    \ impact on the protocol as a whole, and basic underlying\n   architectural principles\
    \ of the protocol can be violated.  Also,\n   there is a risk that mutually incompatible\
    \ extensions may be\n   developed independently.\n   Of course, the IETF itself\
    \ is not immune to such mistakes, suggesting\n   a need for WGs to document their\
    \ design decisions (including paths\n   rejected) and some rationale for those\
    \ decisions, for the benefit of\n   both those within the IETF and those outside\
    \ the IETF, perhaps years\n   later.\n   Documentation of non-IETF extensions\
    \ can sometimes be hard to obtain,\n   so assessing the quality of the specification,\
    \ verifying\n   interoperability, and verifying compatibility with other extensions\n\
    \   (including past and future extensions) can be hard or impossible.\n   A set\
    \ of interrelated extensions to multiple protocols typically\n   carries a greater\
    \ danger of interoperability issues or\n   incompatibilities than a simple extension.\
    \  Consequently, it is\n   important that such proposals receive earlier and more\
    \ in-depth\n   review than unitary extensions.\n   All that can be said about\
    \ extensions applies with equal or greater\n   force to variations -- in fact,\
    \ by definition, protocol variations\n   damage interoperability.  They must,\
    \ therefore, be intensely\n   scrutinized.  An extension adds features and, if\
    \ well designed,\n   allows interoperability between old and new implementations.\
    \  A\n   variation modifies features in such a way that old and new\n   implementations\
    \ may not interoperate.  Throughout this document, what\n   is said about extensions\
    \ also applies to variations.\n"

- title: 3.1.  The Importance of Interoperability
  contents:
  - "3.1.  The Importance of Interoperability\n   According to its Mission Statement\
    \ [RFC3935], the IETF produces high\n   quality, relevant technical and engineering\
    \ documents, including\n   protocol standards.  The mission statement goes on\
    \ to say that the\n   benefit of these standards to the Internet \"is in interoperability\
    \ -\n   that multiple products implementing a standard are able to work\n   together\
    \ in order to deliver valuable functions to the Internet's\n   users\".\n   One\
    \ consequence of this mission is that the IETF designs protocols\n   for the single\
    \ Internet.  The IETF expects its protocols to work the\n   same everywhere. \
    \ Protocol extensions designed for limited\n   environments may be reasonable\
    \ provided that products with these\n   extensions interoperate with products\
    \ without the extensions.\n   Extensions that break interoperability are unacceptable\
    \ when products\n   with and without the extension are mixed.  It is the IETF's\n\
    \   experience that this tends to happen on the Internet even when the\n   original\
    \ designers of the extension did not expect this to happen.\n   Another consequence\
    \ of this definition of interoperability is that\n   the IETF values the ability\
    \ to exchange one product implementing a\n   protocol with another.  The IETF\
    \ often specifies mandatory-to-\n   implement functionality as part of its protocols\
    \ so that there is a\n   core set of functionality sufficient for interoperability\
    \ that all\n   products implement.  The IETF tries to avoid situations where\n\
    \   protocols need to be profiled to specify which optional features are\n   required\
    \ for a given environment, because doing so harms\n   interoperability on the\
    \ Internet as a whole.\n   The IETF, and in particular the IESG, will apply these\
    \ considerations\n   when evaluating protocol extensions proposed inside or outside\
    \ the\n   IETF.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Registered Values and the Importance of IANA Assignments
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Registered Values and the Importance of IANA Assignments\n   An extension\
    \ is often likely to make use of additional values added\n   to an existing IANA\
    \ registry (in many cases, simply by adding a new\n   \"TLV\" (type-length-value)\
    \ field).  It is essential that such new\n   values are properly registered by\
    \ the applicable procedures,\n   including expert review where applicable (see\
    \ BCP 26, [RFC2434]).\n   Extensions may even need to create new IANA registries\
    \ in some cases.\n   Experience shows that the importance of this is often underestimated\n\
    \   during extension design; designers sometimes assume that a new\n   codepoint\
    \ is theirs for the asking, or even simply for the taking.\n   This is hazardous;\
    \ it is far too likely that someone just taking a\n   protocol value will find\
    \ that the same value will later be formally\n   assigned to another function,\
    \ thus guaranteeing an interoperability\n   problem.\n   In many cases, IANA assignment\
    \ requests trigger a thorough technical\n   review of the proposal by a designated\
    \ IETF expert reviewer.\n   Requests are sometimes refused after such a review.\
    \  Thus, extension\n   designers must pay particular attention to any needed IANA\n\
    \   assignments and to the applicable criteria.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Significant Extensions Require Technical Review
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Significant Extensions Require Technical Review\n   Some extensions may\
    \ be considered minor (e.g., adding a\n   straightforward new TLV to an application\
    \ protocol, which will only\n   impact a subset of hosts) and some may be considered\
    \ major (e.g.,\n   adding a new IP option type, which will potentially impact\
    \ every node\n   on the Internet).  This is essentially a matter of judgment.\
    \  It\n   could be argued that anything requiring at most Expert Review in\n \
    \  [RFC2434] is probably minor, and anything beyond that is major.\n   However,\
    \ even an apparently minor extension may have unforeseen\n   consequences on interoperability.\
    \  Thus, the distinction between\n   major and minor is less important than ensuring\
    \ that the right amount\n   of technical review takes place in either case.  In\
    \ general, the\n   expertise for such review lies within the same SDO that developed\
    \ the\n   original protocol.  Therefore, the expertise for such review for IETF\n\
    \   protocols lies within the IETF.\n   There may sometimes be doubt whether a\
    \ particular proposal is or is\n   not truly a protocol extension.  When in doubt,\
    \ it is preferable to\n   err on the side of additional review.  However, it should\
    \ be noted\n   that if an 'extension' only consists of registering a new value\
    \ with\n   IANA in a First Come First Served registry [RFC2434], this document\n\
    \   is not intended to require formal IETF review.  Informal review by\n   experts\
    \ may, nevertheless, be valuable.  In other cases (Section 5),\n   there is a\
    \ well-specified procedure for extensions that should be\n   followed.\n   The\
    \ only safe rule is that, even if an extension appears minor to the\n   person\
    \ proposing it, early review by subject matter experts is\n   advisable.  For\
    \ protocols that have been developed in the IETF, the\n   appropriate forum for\
    \ such review is the IETF, either in the relevant\n   WG or Area, or by individual\
    \ IETF experts if no such WG exists.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Quality and Consistency
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Quality and Consistency\n   In order to be adequately reviewed by relevant\
    \ experts, a proposed\n   extension must be documented in a clear and well-written\n\
    \   specification that IETF subject matter experts have access to and can\n  \
    \ review.  Ideally, such a document would be published as an Internet\n   Draft,\
    \ using terminology and content that is sufficiently consistent\n   with the unextended\
    \ specification that these experts can readily\n   identify the technical changes\
    \ proposed at an early stage.\n"
- title: 3.5.  The Role of Formal Liaisons
  contents:
  - "3.5.  The Role of Formal Liaisons\n   The IETF has formal liaisons in place with\
    \ a number of SDOs;\n   documentation of the liaison process is in [RFC4052],\
    \ [RFC4053], and\n   [RFC4691].  These liaison channels should be used as relevant\
    \ for\n   discussing and reviewing extensions, as should informal communication\n\
    \   at the engineering level (for example, experts from other SDOs are\n   welcome\
    \ to participate in IETF meetings and mailing lists).  Where\n   formal liaison\
    \ does not exist, the point of contact in the IETF\n   should be the Chairs of\
    \ relevant WGs, the most appropriate Area\n   Director, or, in case of doubt,\
    \ the IESG as a whole.\n"
- title: 4.  Procedure for Review of Extensions
  contents:
  - "4.  Procedure for Review of Extensions\n   In some cases, explicit provision\
    \ is made in the relevant RFCs for\n   extending individual IETF protocols.  Nothing\
    \ in this document\n   overrides such procedures.  Some such cases are mentioned\
    \ in\n   Section 5.\n   There are several ways in which an extension to an IETF\
    \ protocol can\n   be considered for publication as an RFC:\n   1.  Extensions\
    \ to IETF protocols developed within the IETF will be\n       subject to the normal\
    \ IETF process, exactly like new designs.  It\n       is not suggested that this\
    \ is a panacea; appropriate cross-\n       working-group and cross-area review\
    \ is needed within the IETF to\n       avoid oversights and mistakes.\n   2. \
    \ Extensions to IETF protocols discussed in an IRTF Research Group\n       may\
    \ well be the prelude to regular IETF discussion.  However, a\n       Research\
    \ Group may desire to specify an experimental extension\n       before the work\
    \ is mature enough for IETF processing.  In this\n       case, the Research Group\
    \ is required to involve appropriate IETF\n       or IANA experts in their process\
    \ to avoid oversights.\n   3.  Extensions to IETF protocols described in Independent\
    \ Submissions\n       to the RFC Editor are subject to IESG review, currently\
    \ described\n       in BCP 92 [RFC3932].  If appropriate, the IESG advises the\
    \ RFC\n       Editor that full IETF processing is needed, or that relevant IANA\n\
    \       procedures need to be followed before publication can proceed.\n     \
    \  Note that Independent Submissions cannot be placed on the IETF\n       Standards\
    \ Track; they would need to enter full IETF processing.\n   Where vendors or other\
    \ SDOs identify a requirement for extending an\n   IETF protocol, their first\
    \ step should be to consider the scenarios\n   listed in Section 1.  If the requirement\
    \ is straightforward and\n   within the scope of a documented extension mechanism,\
    \ the way is\n   clear, and the documented mechanism must be followed.  If these\
    \ two\n   conditions are not met, the next step should be to contact the\n   relevant\
    \ IETF Area Director to check whether there is an active WG in\n   the area or,\
    \ at least, relevant expertise available in the IETF.  At\n   this point, it will\
    \ be possible to select the most appropriate of the\n   above three routes.  Regular\
    \ IETF process is most likely to be\n   suitable, assuming sufficient interest\
    \ can be found in the IETF\n   community.  IRTF process is unlikely to be suitable\
    \ unless there is a\n   genuine research context for the proposed extension.\n\
    \   In the event that the IETF no longer has relevant expertise, there\n   are\
    \ still two choices to discuss with the Area Director: bring the\n   work to the\
    \ IETF (i.e., the IETF imports expertise) or reach mutual\n   agreement to do\
    \ the work elsewhere (i.e., the IETF explicitly exports\n   change control).\n\
    \   In the case of an SDO that identifies a requirement for a\n   standardized\
    \ extension, a standards development process within the\n   IETF (while maintaining\
    \ appropriate liaison) is strongly recommended\n   in preference to publishing\
    \ a non-IETF standard.  Otherwise, the\n   implementor community will be faced\
    \ with a standard split into two or\n   more parts in different styles, obtained\
    \ from different sources, with\n   no unitary control over quality, compatibility,\
    \ interoperability, and\n   intellectual property conditions.  Note that, since\
    \ participation in\n   the IETF is open, there is no formality or restriction\
    \ for\n   participants in other SDOs choosing to work in the IETF as well.  In\n\
    \   some cases (see Section 5), the IETF has well-defined procedures for\n   this\
    \ in place.\n   Naturally, SDOs can and do develop scenarios, requirements, and\n\
    \   architectures based on IETF specifications.  It is only actual\n   protocol\
    \ extensions and changes that need to go through the IETF\n   process.  However,\
    \ there is large risk of wasted effort if\n   significant investment is made in\
    \ planning stages for use of IETF\n   technology without early review and feedback\
    \ from the IETF.  Other\n   SDOs are encouraged to communicate informally or formally\
    \ with the\n   IETF as early as possible, to avoid false starts.  Early technical\n\
    \   review in a collaborative spirit is of great value.  Each SDO can\n   \"own\"\
    \ its ideas and discuss them in its own fora, but should start\n   talking to\
    \ the IETF experts about those ideas the moment the idea is\n   well formulated.\
    \  It is understood that close collaboration may be\n   needed in order that the\
    \ IETF experts correctly understand the\n   systems architecture envisaged by\
    \ the other SDO.  This is much\n   preferable to a situation where another SDO\
    \ presents the IANA and the\n   IETF with a 'fait accompli.'\n   Vendors that\
    \ identify a requirement for an extension are strongly\n   recommended to start\
    \ informal discussion in the IETF and to publish a\n   preliminary Internet Draft\
    \ describing the requirements.  This will\n   allow the vendor, and the community,\
    \ to evaluate whether there is\n   community interest and whether there are any\
    \ major or fundamental\n   issues.  However, in the case of a vendor that identifies\
    \ a\n   requirement for a proprietary extension that does not generate\n   interest\
    \ in the IETF (or IRTF) communities, an Independent Submission\n   to the RFC\
    \ Editor is strongly recommended in preference to publishing\n   a proprietary\
    \ document.  Not only does this bring the draft to the\n   attention of the community,\
    \ but it also ensures a minimum of review\n   [RFC3932], and (if published as\
    \ an RFC) makes the proprietary\n   extension available to the whole community.\n\
    \   If, despite these recommendations, a vendor or SDO does choose to\n   publish\
    \ its own specification for an extension to an IETF protocol,\n   the following\
    \ guidance applies:\n   o  Extensions to IETF protocols should be well, and publicly,\n\
    \      documented, and reviewed at an early stage by the IETF community\n    \
    \  to be sure that the extension does not undermine basic assumptions\n      and\
    \ safeguards designed into the protocol (such as security\n      functions) or\
    \ its architectural integrity.\n   o  Vendors and other SDOs are formally requested\
    \ to submit any such\n      proposed publications for IETF review, and are invited\
    \ to actively\n      participate in the IETF process.  Submission may be by an\n\
    \      established liaison channel if it exists, or by direct\n      communication\
    \ with the relevant WG or the IESG.  This should be\n      done at an early stage,\
    \ before a large investment of effort has\n      taken place, in case basic problems\
    \ are revealed.  When there is a\n      formal liaison in place between the other\
    \ SDO and the IETF, the\n      liaison channel should be used to ensure that review\
    \ takes place,\n      both by relevant experts and by established review teams\
    \ or\n      Directorates within the IETF.  If there is no formal liaison, the\n\
    \      other SDO or vendor should ask the IESG (or a relevant Area\n      Director)\
    \ to obtain such reviews.  Note that general aspects such\n      as security,\
    \ internationalization, and management may need review,\n      as well as the\
    \ protocol as such.\n   o  In the case of extensions involving only routine IANA\
    \ parameter\n      assignments, for which there is an underlying IETF specification\n\
    \      containing clear IANA Considerations, this request is satisfied as\n  \
    \    long as those considerations are satisfied (see [RFC2434]).\n      Anything\
    \ beyond this requires an explicit protocol review by\n      experts within the\
    \ IETF.\n   o  Note that, like IETF specifications, such proposed publications\n\
    \      must include an IANA Considerations section to ensure that\n      protocol\
    \ parameter assignments that are needed to deploy\n      extensions are not made\
    \ until after a proposed extension has\n      received adequate review, and then\
    \ to ensure that IANA has precise\n      guidance on how to make those assignments.\n"
- title: 5.  Some Specific Issues
  contents:
  - "5.  Some Specific Issues\n   It is relatively common for MIB modules, which are\
    \ all, in effect,\n   extensions of the SMI data model, to be defined or extended\
    \ outside\n   the IETF.  BCP 111 [RFC4181] offers detailed guidance for authors\
    \ and\n   reviewers.\n   A number of protocols have foreseen experimental values\
    \ for certain\n   IANA parameters, so that experimental usages and extensions\
    \ may be\n   tested without need for a special parameter assignment.  It must\
    \ be\n   stressed that such values are not intended for production use or as a\n\
    \   way to evade the type of technical review described in this document.\n  \
    \ See [RFC3692] and [RFC4727].\n   RADIUS [RFC2865] is designed to carry attributes\

    \ of new\n   attributes involve the IETF community of experts knowledgeable about\n\
    \   the protocol's architecture and existing usage in order to fully\n   understand\

- title: 6.  Intellectual Property
  contents:
  - "6.  Intellectual Property\n   All IETF documents fall under the IETF's intellectual\
    \ property rules,\n   BCP 78 [RFC3978] and BCP 79 [RFC3979], as amended.  In particular,\n\
    \   there are restrictions on the production of derivative works, and\n   there\
    \ are rights that remain with the original authors.  Anybody\n   outside the IETF\
    \ considering an extension based on an IETF document\n   must bear these legal\
    \ restrictions and rights in mind.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   An extension must not introduce new security\
    \ risks without also\n   providing an adequate counter-measure, and in particular\
    \ it must not\n   inadvertently defeat security measures in the unextended protocol.\n\
    \   This aspect must always be considered during IETF review.\n"
- title: 8.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   The IETF requests IANA to pay attention to the requirements\
    \ of this\n   document when requested to make protocol parameter assignments for\n\
    \   vendors or other SDOs, i.e., to respect the IANA Considerations of\n   all\
    \ RFCs that contain them, and the general considerations of BCP 26\n   [RFC2434].\n"
