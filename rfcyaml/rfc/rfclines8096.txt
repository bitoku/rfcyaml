In 2005 2006, the IPv6 MIB update group published updated versions of the IP MIB, UDP MIB, TCP MIB, and IP FORWARD MIB modules, which use the InetAddressType/InetAddress construct to handle IPv4 and IPv6 in the same table.
This document contains versions of the obsoleted IPV6 MIB, IPV6 TC, IPV6 ICMP MIB, IPV6 TCP MIB, and IPV6 UDP MIB modules for the purpose of updating MIB module repositories.
This document obsoletes RFCs 2452, 2454, 2465, and 2466 (i.e., the RFCs containing these MIBs) and reclassifies them as Historic.
In 2005 2006, the IPv6 MIB update group published updated versions of the IP MIB [RFC4293], UDP MIB [RFC4113], TCP MIB [RFC4022], and IP  FORWARD
MIB [RFC4292] modules, which use the InetAddressType/ InetAddress construct to handle IPv4 and IPv6 in the same table.
The RFC Editor marked these documents as obsoleting the corresponding IPV6 MIBs, but the extracted content of these MIBs never changed in MIB repositories, and the original RFCs (as is normal IETF policy) never changed from being Proposed Standard.
Note that the timeline of these MIB modules is as shown below (and it is the added support for IPv6 in the later revision of the original modules that people often overlook).
This causes an unclear situation when simply looking at MIB repositories, so we are simply republishing these MIB modules with the Structure of Management Information (SMI) status changed to obsolete.
This is an unusual step, and it is not the intended path with every obsolete MIB module; the special history of these modules led to this special step.

If this network interface operates over another IPv6 interface, the value of this object refers to an instance of ipv6IfIndex.

For example, for an IPv6 interface attached to an 802.x link, this object normally contains a MAC address.
Note that in some cases this address may differ from the address of the interface's protocol sub layer.

The desired state of the interface.
When a managed system initializes, all IPv6 interfaces start with ipv6IfAdminStatus in the down(2) state.
As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ipv6IfAdminStatus is then changed to the up(1) state (or remains in the down(2) state).
IPv6 does not have a separate admin status; the admin status of the interface is represented by IF MIB::ifAdminStatus."
The current operational state of the interface.
The noIfIdentifier(3) state indicates that no valid Interface Identifier is assigned to the interface.
This state usually indicates that the link local interface address failed Duplicate Address Detection.
If ipv6IfAdminStatus is down(2) then ipv6IfOperStatus should be down(2).
If ipv6IfAdminStatus is changed to up(1)
then ipv6IfOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should remain in the down(2)
or noIfIdentifier(3) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(5) state if the interface has missing (typically, lower layer) components.
IPv6 does not have a separate operational status; the operational status of the interface is represented by IF MIB::ifOperStatus."

The obsolete MIB module for entities implementing TCP over IPv6.

REVISION "201702220000Z" DESCRIPTION "Obsoleting this MIB module; it has been replaced by the revised TCP MIB (RFC 4022)."
This connection table contains information about this   entity's existing TCP connections between IPv6 endpoints.
Only connections between IPv6 addresses are contained in   this table.

This table is obsoleted by TCP MIB::tcpConnectionTable."
Each row of this table is transient, in that it ceases to exist when (or soon after)
the connection makes the transition to the CLOSED state.
Note that conceptual rows in this table require an additional index object compared to tcpConnTable, since IPv6 addresses are not guaranteed to be unique on the managed node.
This entry is obsoleted by TCP MIB::tcpConnectionEntry.
"The local IPv6 address for this TCP connection.
In the case of a connection in the listen state which is willing to accept connections for any IPv6 address associated with the managed node, the value ::0 is used.
"The local port number for this TCP connection.
This object is obsoleted by TCP MIB::tcpConnectionLocalPort."
The remote IPv6 address for this TCP connection.
This object is obsoleted by TCP MIB::tcpConnectionRemAddress."
This object is obsoleted by TCP MIB::tcpConnectionRemPort."
"An index object used to disambiguate conceptual rows in the table, since the connection 4 tuple may not be unique.
If the connection's remote address (ipv6TcpConnRemAddress) is a link local address and the connection's local address (ipv6TcpConnLocalAddress) is not a link local address, this object identifies a local interface on the same link as the connection's remote link local address.
Otherwise, this object identifies the local interface that is associated with the ipv6TcpConnLocalAddress for this TCP connection.
If such a local interface cannot be determined, this object should take on the value 0.
(A possible example of this would be if the value of ipv6TcpConnLocalAddress is ::0.)
The interface identified by a particular non 0 value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ipv6IfIndex.
The value of this object must remain constant during the life of the TCP connection.
This object is obsoleted by the zone identifier in an InetAddressIPv6z address in either TCP MIB::tcpConnectionLocalAddress or TCP MIB::tcpConnectionRemAddress."
The only value which may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12).
Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return an error response ('badValue' for SNMPv1, 'wrongValue' for SNMPv2) if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value.
If a management station sets this object to the value deleteTCB(12), then this has the effect of deleting the TCB (as defined in RFC 793) of the corresponding connection on the managed node, resulting in immediate termination of the connection.
As an implementation specific option, a RST segment may be sent from the managed node to the other TCP endpoint (note however that RST segments are not sent reliably).
This object is obsoleted by TCP MIB::tcpConnectionState."

This document reclassifies [RFC2452], [RFC2454], [RFC2465], and [RFC2466] to Historic.
This document contains only obsolete objects, which [RFC2578] says "should not be implemented and/or can be removed if previously implemented".
Since the contents of this document should not be implemented, it has no security implications.
If there were any security implications based on these objects in an implementation, removing these objects as [RFC2578] suggests would improve the security of that implementation.
IANA Considerations IANA has updated the SMI Numbers registry at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi numbers/> as described below.
IANA has updated the "SMI Network Management MGMT Codes Internet  standard MIB" section as follows:  Removed RFC 1213 as a reference for mib 2.5 ("icmp").
Updated the reference for mib 2.6 ("tcp") to point to RFC 4022.
Removed RFC 1213 as a reference for mib 2.7 ("udp").
Removed RFC 2012 as a reference for mib 2.49 ("tcpMIB").
Added the "(Historic)" annotation for the entries for mib 2.55 ("ipv6MIB") and mib 2.56 ("ipv6IcmpMIB") and updated the reference of each to point to this document.
IANA has updated the "SMI Experimental Codes" section as follows:  Added the "(Historic)" annotation for experimental.74 ("IPv6 MIB").
Changed the "(Historical)" annotation for experimental.87 ("ipv6UdpMIB") to "(Historic)".
Updated the reference for experimental.86 ("ipv6TcpMIB") and experimental.87 ("ipv6UdpMIB") to point to this document.
