  - "1. Introduction\n   Increasingly, IETF efforts have been devoted to aiding network\n\
    \   management, troubleshooting, and diagnosis. Results have included\n   SNMP,\
    \ cflowd, and RMON, and ongoing projects at the time of this\n   writing include\
    \ Universal Logging Protocol and Distributed\n   Management.  These tools work\
    \ well within the horizon of\n   deterministic situations in which the configuration\
    \ of the network or\n   relevant components is known or can be relatively easily\
    \ determined.\n   They do not well address many problems that are related to the\n\
    \   complex internetworks we have today, such as:\n     o  Networks where the\
    \ root bridge for a world-wide bridged\n        network is suboptimally located,\
    \ such as under the desk of a\n        secretary who kicks off her shoes when\
    \ she arrives in the\n        morning.\n     o  Networks where a hub is located\
    \ adjacent to a monitor that\n        emits disruptive RF when displaying certain\
    \ graphics.\n     o  Networks where an ISP and several of their customers use\n\
    \        network 10.0.0.0 internally and do not hide RIP broadcasts from\n   \
    \     one another.\n     o  Networks where gateways are data-sensitive\n     o\
    \  Networks where vendors inadvertently ship units with\n        duplicate MAC\
    \ addresses to the same end-user or where all users\n        have a tool for changing\
    \ MAC addresses.\n   In this document we introduce a new hardware-based tool for\
    \ diagnosis\n   and repair of network related hardware and software problems.\
    \ This\n   tool is best suited to addressing nondeterministic problems such as\n\
    \   those described above. This tool has broad areas of application at\n   all\
    \ levels of the OSI model; in addition to uses in the physical,\n   network, transport\
    \ and application layers, it has been used to\n   successfully address problems\
    \ at the political and religious layers\n   as well. RITA, the Reliable Internet\
    \ Troubleshooting Agent, was\n   developed initially at The Leftbank Operation\
    \ (now known as Cohesive\n   Network Systems, New England Division) based on a\
    \ hardware platform\n   supplied by Archie McPhee (Reference [1]). A typical RITA\
    \ unit is\n   depicted in Figure 1.\n         comb      neck             body\

- title: 2. Specification
  contents:
  - "2. Specification\n   A typical RITA is 51.25 cm long and yellow-orange in color.\
    \  Either\n   natural or artificial substances may be used for construction. \
    \ RITA\n   has very flexible characteristics, and thus can interoperate within\n\
    \   fairly broad parameters.  Unlike most other tools described in\n   forthcoming\
    \ RFC's, RITA does not require any IANA namespace\n   management.  It is not anticipated\
    \ that versions will be\n   incompatible, thus no versioning field is present.\
    \ Interoperability\n   testing may be conducted at a future meeting of the IETF.\n"
- title: '3. Diagnostic Usage:'
  contents:
  - "3. Diagnostic Usage:\n   RITA may be applied in two diagnostic fashions, however\
    \ only one of\n   these methods, described below in 3.1, has been refined to a\
    \ state\n   such that we feel comfortable publishing the methodology.\n   3.1\
    \   The first method provides a broad-spectrum evaluation of\n   quality of the\
    \ entity tested, and is thus known as the BS eval test.\n   This method can be\
    \ used with great success on both deterministic and\n   non-deterministic problems.\
    \  Testing is performed by placing the RITA\n   unit on top of a suspect piece\
    \ of hardware, or, in the case of\n   software, placing the unit on a packaged\
    \ copy of the program, or hard\n   copy of the source code.\n   If the RITA does\
    \ not get up and fly away, the hardware or software\n   being tested is misconfigured,\
    \ fubar, or broken as designed. While\n   this method does identify all equipment\
    \ and software as sub-optimal,\n   Sturgeon's Law (see reference [5]) indicates\
    \ that at least 90% of\n   these results are accurate, and it is felt that a maximum\
    \ 10% false\n   positive result is within acceptable parameters.\n   3.2 The second\
    \ method involves applications of traditional techniques\n   of haruspication\
    \ (see reference [3]) and to date has been practiced\n   with much greater success\
    \ using implements other than RITA. The\n   absence of entrails in the RITA unit\
    \ may contribute to this; future\n   design enhancements may address this issue\
    \ by the addition of\n   artificial giblets.\n   An alternative approach that\
    \ has been discarded involved cleromantic\n   principles (see reference [3]),\
    \ and was known as \"flipping the bird\".\n"
- title: '4. Corrective Usage:'
  contents:
  - "4. Corrective Usage:\n   Corrective usage of RITA is most successful in dealing\
    \ with the most\n   difficult class of networking problems: those that seem to\
    \ exhibit\n   sporadic, non-deterministic behavior.\n   RITA units enhance normal\
    \ corrective measures of these problems,\n   methods such as rebooting, reseating\
    \ of components and connectors,\n   changing tabs to spaces or vice-versa in configuration\
    \ files, blaming\n   third-party vendors, and use of ballistic implements to effect\n\
    \   wholesale displacement of systems and software, to at least 100% of\n   their\
    \ normal efficacy.\n    Specific Problem Methodologies:\n     o  Physical Layer:\
    \ Wave RITA unit towards malfunctioning\n        components.\n     o  Network\
    \ Layer: Wave RITA unit towards malfunctioning\n        components.\n     o  Transport\
    \ Layer: Wave RITA unit towards malfunctioning\n        components.\n     o  Application\
    \ Layer: Strike product vendor representative\n        (or programmer, if available)\
    \ with RITA, preferably on the top\n        of the skull, while shouting, \"Read\
    \ The Fine RFC's comma darn\n        it!\"\n     o  Political Layer: Strike advocates\
    \ of disruptive or\n        obstructive policies with RITA, preferably on the\
    \ top of the\n        skull. In extreme cases insertion of RITA into bodily apertures\n\
    \        may become necessary. WARNING: subsequent failure to remove RITA\n  \
    \      may cause further problems.\n     o  Religious Layer: Strike advocates\
    \ of disruptive or\n        obstructive religions, and their vendor representatives,\
    \ with\n        RITA, preferably on the top of the skull. In extreme cases, the\n\
    \        RITA may be used as a phlactory, funerary urn, or endcap for\n      \
    \  bus-and-tag cables.\n"

- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   The RITA will only have serious impact on system\
    \ security facilities\n   if it is filled with lead shot. It does however, increase\
    \ the\n   personal security of system administrators; few network toughs are\n\
    \   willing to face down a sysadmin armed with a RITA and a confident\n   demeanor.\n"
