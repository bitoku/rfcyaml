  title: Status of This Memo
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the WITHIN extension to IMAP SEARCH.  IMAP\n
    \  SEARCH returns messages whose internal date is within or outside a\n   specified
    interval.  The mechanism described here, OLDER and YOUNGER,\n   differs from BEFORE
    and SINCE in that the client specifies an\n   interval, rather than a date.  WITHIN
    is useful for persistent\n   searches where either the device does not have the
    capacity to\n   perform the search at regular intervals or the network is of limited\n
    \  bandwidth and thus there is a desire to reduce network traffic from\n   sending
    repeated requests and redundant responses.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This extension exposes two new search keys, OLDER and YOUNGER,
    each\n   of which takes a non-zero integer argument corresponding to a time\n
    \  interval in seconds.  The server calculates the time of interest by\n   subtracting
    the time interval the client presents from the current\n   date and time of the
    server.  The server then either returns messages\n   older or younger than the
    resultant time and date, depending on the\n   search key used.\n"

    - "1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   In examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\"
      indicate lines sent by the client and\n   server, respectively.\n   The key
      words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\",
      \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document
      are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n   When describing
      the general syntax, we omit some definitions, as RFC\n   3501 [RFC3501] defines
      them.\n"

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Protocol Operation\n   An IMAP4 server that supports the capability described
    here MUST\n   return \"WITHIN\" as one of the server supported capabilities in
    the\n   CAPABILITY command.\n   For both the OLDER and YOUNGER search keys, the
    server calculates a\n   target date and time by subtracting the interval, specified
    in\n   seconds, from the current date and time of the server.  The server\n   then
    compares the target time with the INTERNALDATE of the message,\n   as specified
    in IMAP [RFC3501].  For OLDER, messages match if the\n   INTERNALDATE is less
    recent than or equal to the target time.  For\n   YOUNGER, messages match if the
    INTERNALDATE is more recent than or\n   equal to the target time.\n   Both OLDER
    and YOUNGER searches always result in exact matching, to\n   the resolution of
    a second.  However, if one is doing a dynamic\n   evaluation, for example, in
    a context [CONTEXT], one needs to be\n   aware that the server might perform the
    evaluation periodically.\n   Thus, the server may delay the updates.  Clients
    MUST be aware that\n   dynamic search results may not reflect the current state
    of the\n   mailbox.  If the client needs a search result that reflects the\n   current
    state of the mailbox, we RECOMMEND that the client issue a\n   new search.\n"

    \  Form (ABNF) notation.  Elements not defined here can be found in the\n   formal
    syntax of ABNF [RFC4234] and IMAP [RFC3501].\n   This document extends RFC 3501
    [RFC3501] with two new search keys:\n   OLDER <interval> and YOUNGER <interval>.\n
    \  search-key =/ ( \"OLDER\" / \"YOUNGER\" ) SP nz-number\n                  ;
    search-key defined in RFC 3501\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The WITHIN extension does not raise any security
    considerations that\n   are not present in the base protocol.  Considerations
    are the same as\n   for IMAP [RFC3501].\n"
  title: 5.  Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   Per the IMAP RFC [RFC3501], registration of a new
    IMAP capability in\n   the IMAP Capability registry requires the publication of
    a standards-\n   track RFC or an IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry
    is\n   currently located at\n   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities>.
    \ This\n   standards-track document defines the WITHIN IMAP capability.  IANA\n
    \  has added this extension to the IANA IMAP Capability registry.\n"
