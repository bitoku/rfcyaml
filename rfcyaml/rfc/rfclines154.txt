As a pedagogical device for describing functions such as the one below
a   where two formulae, f1 and f2, are necessary for adjoining domains but the function is continous at the boundary point, I usually write the description in the form f(x)
f1(x) for x  < a f(x)   f2(x) for x
a The astute reader will note that the domains overlap, but that f1(a)   f2(a), so no semantic ambiguity obtains.
