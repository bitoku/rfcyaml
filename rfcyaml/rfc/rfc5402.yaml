- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Historically, electronic messages produced by systems following\
    \ the\n   guidelines as outlined in the IETF EDIINT Working Group\n   specifications\
    \ AS1 [AS1], AS2 [AS2], and AS3 [AS3] did not have a way\n   to provide a standardized\
    \ transport neutral mechanism for compressing\n   large payloads.  However, with\
    \ the development of RFC 3274,\n   \"Compressed Data Content Type for Cryptographic\
    \ Message Syntax\n   (CMS)\", we now have a transport-neutral mechanism for compressing\n\
    \   large payloads.\n   A typical EDIINT 'AS' message is a multi-layered MIME\
    \ message,\n   consisting of one or more of the following: payload layer, signature\n\
    \   layer, and/or encryption layer.  When an 'AS' message is received, a\n   Message\
    \ Integrity Check (MIC) value must be computed based upon\n   defined rules within\
    \ the EDIINT 'AS' RFCs and must be returned to the\n   sender of the message via\
    \ a Message Disposition Notification (MDN).\n   The addition of a new compression\
    \ layer will require this document to\n   outline new procedures for building/layering\
    \ 'AS' messages and\n   computing a MIC value that is returned in the MDN receipt.\n\
    \   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\"\
    ,\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Compressed Data MIME Layer
  contents:
  - "2.  Compressed Data MIME Layer\n   The compressed-data CMS (Cryptographic Message\
    \ Syntax) MIME entity as\n   described in [COMPRESSED-DATA] may encapsulate a\
    \ MIME entity that\n   consists of either an unsigned or signed business document.\n\
    \   Implementers are to follow the appropriate specifications identified\n   in\
    \ the \"MIME Media Types\" registry [MIME-TYPES] maintained by IANA\n   for the\
    \ type of object being packaged.  For example, to package an\n   XML object, the\
    \ MIME media type of \"application/xml\" is used in the\n   Content-Type MIME\
    \ header field and the specifications for enveloping\n   the object are contained\
    \ in [XMLTYPES].\n   MIME entity example:\n   Content-type: application/xml; charset=\"\
    utf-8\"\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n   <!-- sample xml document\
    \ -->\n   The MIME entity will be compressed using [ZLIB] and placed inside a\n\
    \   CMS compressed-data object as outlined in [COMPRESSED-DATA].  The\n   compressed-data\
    \ object will be MIME encapsulated according to details\n   outlined in [S/MIME3.1],\
    \ RFC 3851, Section 3.5.\n   Example:\n   Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime;\

    \   Note: Content-Transfer-Encoding of base64 would only be required if\n   the\
    \ compressed-data MIME bodypart is transferred via a 7-bit protocol\n   like SMTP\
    \ and is visible in the outer layer of the MIME message.  If\n   the compressed-data\
    \ MIME bodypart is placed inside of an encrypted\n   MIME bodypart, content-transfer-encoding\
    \ would not be required on the\n   compressed-data MIME bodypart, but would be\
    \ required on the encrypted\n   MIME bodypart.\n"

  - "3.  Structure of an EDI MIME Compressed Message\n   When compressing a document\
    \ that will be signed, the application MAY\n   compress the innermost MIME body\
    \ before signing (see Sections 3.2 and\n   3.5), or it MAY compress the outer\
    \ multipart/signed MIME body (see\n   Sections 3.3 and 3.6), but it MUST NOT do\
    \ both within the same\n   document.  The receiving application MUST support both\
    \ methods of\n   compression when unpackaging an inbound document.\n   Note: The\
    \ following sections (3.1 - 3.6) show the individual layers\n   of a properly\
    \ formatted EDI MIME message with a compressed data\n   layer.  Please refer to\
    \ the appropriate RFCs for the proper\n   construction of the resulting MIME message.\
