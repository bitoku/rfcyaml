    \ ARPA's  Committee  on  Computer-Aided  Human   Communication\n(CAHCOM)  wishes\
    \  to promulgate a standard for the format of ARPA\nNetwork text message (mail)\
    \ headers which  will  reasonably  meet\nthe  needs  of  the  various  message\
    \  service  subsystems on the\nNetwork today.  The  authors  of  this  document\
    \  constitute  the\nCAHCOM  subcommittee charged with the task of developing this\
    \ new\nstandard.\n     Essentially, we specify a revision to  ARPANET  Request\
    \  for\nComments (RFC) 561, \"Standardizing Network Mail Headers\", and RFC\n\
    680, \"Message Transmission Protocol\".  This revision removes  and\ncompacts\
    \  portions  of  the  previous  syntax  and  adds  several\nfeatures to network\
    \ address  specification.   In  particular,  we\nfocus  on  people  and  not \
    \ mailboxes  as  recipients  and allow\nreference to stored address lists.   We\
    \  expect  this  syntax  to\nprovide  sufficient  capabilities  to  meet most\
    \ users' immediate\nneeds and, therefore, give developers enough  breathing  room\
    \  to\nproduce  a new mail transmission protocol \"properly\".  We believe\nthat\
    \ there is enough of a consensus in the Network  community  in\nfavor  of such\
    \ a standard syntax to make possible its adoption at\nthis time.  An earlier draft\
    \ of this specification was  published\nas  RFC  #724, \"Proposed Official Standard\
    \ for the Format of ARPA\nNetwork Messages\"  and  contained  extensive  discussion\
    \  of  the\nbackground and issues in ARPANET mail standards.\n     This specification\
    \ was developed  over  the  course  of  one\nyear,  using  the ARPANET mail environment,\
    \ itself, to provide an\non-going forum for discussing the capabilities  to  be\
    \  included.\nMore   than   twenty   individuals,   from  across  the  country,\n\
    participated in this discussion and we would like to  acknowledge\ntheir  considerable\
    \  efforts.   The  syntax  of  the standard was\noriginally specified in the Backus-Naur\

    \ I.  INTRODUCTION\n     This standard specifies a syntax for text messages which\
    \ are\npassed between computer users within the framework of \"electronic\nmail\"\
    .  The standard supersedes the informal standards  specified\nin  ARPANET  Request\
    \  for  Comments  numbers  561, \"Standardizing\nNetwork Mail Headers\", and 680,\
    \ \"Message Transmission  Protocol\".\nIn  this  document,  a  general framework\
    \ is first described; the\nformal syntax is then specified, followed by a discussion\
    \ of  the\nsemantics.  Finally, a number of examples are given.\n     This specification\
    \ is intended strictly as a  definition  of\nwhat  is  to  be  passed between\
    \ hosts on the ARPANET.  It is NOT\nintended to dictate either features which\
    \ systems on the  Network\nare  expected  to support, or user interfaces to message\
    \ creating\nor reading programs.\n     A distinction should be made between what\
    \ the  specification\nREQUIRES  and  what  it ALLOWS.  Messages can be made complex\
    \ and\nrich with formally-structured components of information or can be\nkept\
    \ small and simple, with a minimum of such information.  Also,\nthe standard simplifies\
    \ the interpretation  of  differing  visual\nformats in messages.  These simplifications\
    \ facilitate the formal\nspecification and indicate what the OFFICIAL  semantics\
    \  are  for\nmessages.   Only  the  visual aspect of a message is affected and\n\
    not the interpretation of information  within  it.   Implementors\nmay choose\
    \ to retain such visual distinctions.\n                         II.  FRAMEWORK\n\
    \     Since there are many message systems which exist outside the\nARPANET environment,\
    \ as well as those within it, it may be useful\nto consider the general framework,\
    \ and resulting capabilities and\nlimitations, provided by this standard.\n  \
    \   Messages are expected to  consist  of  lines  of  text.   No\nspecial provisions\
    \ are made, at this time, for encoding drawings,\nfacsimile, speech, or structured\
    \ text.\n     No significant consideration has been given to questions  of\ndata\
    \   compression   or   transmission/storage  efficiency.   The\nstandard, in fact,\
    \ tends to be very free with the number of  bits\nconsumed.   For  example, field\
    \ names are specified as free text,\nrather than special terse codes.\n     A\
    \ general \"memo\" framework is  used.   That  is,  a  message\nconsists  of some\
    \ information, in a rigid format, followed by the\nmain part of the message, which\
    \ is text and whose format  is  not\nspecified  in this document.  The syntax\
    \ of several fields of the\nrigidly-formated  (\"header\")   section   is   defined\
    \   in   this\nspecification;  some of the header fields must be included in all\n\
    messages.  The syntax  which  distinguishes  between  headers  is\nspecified \
    \ separately  from  the  internal  syntax for particular\nheaders.  This separation\
    \ is intended to allow  extremely  simple\nparsers  to operate on the overall\
    \ structure of messages, without\nconcern  for  the  detailed  structure  of \
    \ individual   headers.\nAppendix B is provided to facilitate construction of\
    \ these simple\nparsers.  In addition to the fields specified in  this  document,\n\
    it  is  expected  that  other fields will gain common use.  User-\ndefined header\
    \ fields allow systems to extend their functionality\nwhile  maintaining  a uniform\
    \ framework.  The approach is similar\nto that of the TELNET protocol,  in  that\
    \  a  basic  standard  is\ndefined  which  includes  a  mechanism for (optionally)\
    \ extending\nitself.  As necessary, the authors of this document will regulate\n\
    the  publishing  of  specifications for these \"extension-fields\",\nthrough the\
    \ same mechanisms used to publish this document.\n     Such a  framework  severely\
    \  constrains  document  tone  and\nappearance  and  is  primarily useful for\
    \ most intra-organization\ncommunications  and  relatively   structured   inter-organization\n\
    communication.   A more robust environment might allow for multi-\nfont, multi-color,\
    \ multi-dimension encoding  of  information.   A\nless  robust  environment, \
    \ as  is present in most single-machine\nRECEIVER  of  a  message  can exercise\
    \ an extraordinary amount of\ncontrol over the message's  appearance.   The  amount\
    \  of  actual\n                          III.  SYNTAX\n     This  syntax  is \
    \ given  in  five  parts.   The  first  part\ndescribes  the  notation  used \
    \ in the specification.  The second\npart describes the base-level lexical analyzers\
    \  which  feed  the\nhigher-level  parser  described  in the succeeding sections.\
    \  The\nthird part gives a  general  syntax  for  messages  and  standard\nheader\
    \  fields;  and  the  fourth  part  specifies  the syntax of\naddresses.  A final\
    \ part  specifies  some  general  syntax  which\nsupports the other sections.\n\
    A.  NOTATIONAL CONVENTIONS\nThese specifications are made in an  augmented  Backus-Naur\
    \  Form\n(BNF).  Differences  from  standard  BNF  involve  the  naming of\nrules,\
    \ the indication of repetition and of \"local\" alternatives.\n1.  Rule naming\n\
    Angle brackets (\"<\", \">\") are not used, in general.  The name  of\na   rule\
    \  is  simply  the  name  itself,  rather  than  \"<name>\".\nQuotation-marks\
    \ enclose literal text (which may be  upper  and/or\nlower case).  Certain basic\
    \  rules  are  in  uppercase,  such  as\nSPACE,  TAB, CRLF, DIGIT, ALPHA, etc.\
    \  Angle brackets are used in\nrule definitions, and in the  rest  of  this  document,\
    \  whenever\ntheir presence will facilitate discerning the use of rule names.\n\
    2.  Parentheses:  Local alternatives\nElements enclosed in parentheses are treated\
    \ as a single element.\nThus,  \"(elem  (foo  /  bar)  elem)\" allows \"(elem\
    \ foo elem)\" and\n\"(elem bar elem)\".\n3.  * construct:  Repetition\nThe character\
    \ \"*\" preceding an element indicates repetition.  The\nfull form is:\n     \
    \     <l>*<m>element\nindicating at least <l> and at most <m> occurrences  of\
    \  element.\n  A. Notational Conventions\n4.  <number>element\n\"<n>(element)\"\
    \ is  equivalent  to  \"<n>*<n>(element)\";  that  is,\nexactly  <n>  occurrences\
    \ of (element).  Thus 2DIGIT is a 2-digit\nnumber, and 3ALPHA is a string of three\
    \ alphabetic characters.\n5.  # construct:  Lists\nA construct \"#\" is defined,\
    \ similar to \"*\", as follows:\n                  <l>#<m>element\nindicating\
    \ at least <l> and at most <m> elements, each  separated\nby  one or more commas\
    \ (\",\").  This makes the usual form of lists\nvery easy; a rule such as '(element\
    \ *(\",\" element))' can be shown\nas  \"1#element\".   Wherever this construct\
    \ is used, null elements\nare allowed, but do not  contribute  to  the  count\
    \  of  elements\npresent.   That  is,  \"(element),,(element)\"  is  permitted,\
    \  but\ncounts as only two  elements.   Therefore,  where  at  least  one\nelement\
    \  is  required,  at  least  one  non-null  element must be\npresent.\n6.  [optional]\n\
    Square  brackets  enclose  optional  elements;  \"[foo  bar]\"   is\nequivalent\
    \ to \"*1(foo bar)\".\n7.  ; Comments\nA semi-colon, set off some distance to\
    \ the right  of  rule  text,\nstarts  a  comment which continues to the end of\
    \ line.  This is a\nsimple way  of  including  useful  notes  in  parallel  with\
    \  the\nspecifications.\nB.  LEXICAL ANALYSIS OF MESSAGES\n1.  General Description\n\
    A message consists of headers and, optionally,  a  body  (i.e.  a\nseries of text\
    \ lines).  The text part is just a sequence of lines\n  B. Lexical Analysis\n\
    a.  Folding and unfolding of headers\n    Each header item can be viewed as a\
    \ single, logical  line  of\n    ASCII characters.  For convenience, the field-body\
    \ portion of\n    this conceptual entity can  be  split  into  a  multiple-line\n\
    \    representation  (i.e.,  \"folded\").   The general rule is that\n    wherever\
    \ there can be linear-white-space  (NOT  simply  LWSP-\n    chars), a CRLF immediately\
    \ followed by AT LEAST one LWSP-char\n    can instead be inserted.  (However,\
    \ a header's name  and  the\n    following  colon  (\":\"),  which occur at the\
    \ beginning of the\n    header item, may NOT be folded onto multiple  lines.)\
    \   Thus,\n    the single line\n       To:  \"Joe Dokes & J. Harvey\" <ddd at\
    \ Host>, JJV at BBN\n    can be represented as\n       To:  \"Joe Dokes & J. Harvey\"\
    \ <ddd at Host>,\n            JJV at BBN\n    and\n       To:  \"Joe Dokes & J.\
    \ Harvey\"\n                        <ddd at Host>,\n        JJV at BBN\n    and\n\
    \       To:  \"Joe Dokes\n        & J. Harvey\" <ddd at Host>, JJV at BBN\n  \
    \  The  process  of  moving  from  this   folded   multiple-line\n    representation\
    \   of   a  header  field  to  its  single  line\n    representation will  be\
    \  called  \"unfolding\".   Unfolding  is\n    accomplished  by  regarding  CRLF\
    \  immediately  followed by a\n    LWSP-char as equivalent  to  the  LWSP-char.\n\
    b.  Structure of header fields\n    Once header fields have been unfolded, they\
    \ may be viewed  as\n    being  composed  of  a  field-name followed by a colon\
    \ (\":\"),\n    followed by a field-body.  The field-name must be composed of\n\
    \    printable  ASCII  characters  (i.e.,  characters  which  have\n    values\
    \ between 33.  and  126.,  decimal,  except  colon)  and\n    LWSP-chars.   The\
    \  field-body  may  be  composed of any ASCII\n    characters (other than  an\
    \  unquoted  CRLF,  which  has  been\n    removed by unfolding).\n    Certain\
    \ field-bodies of  header  fields  may  be  interpreted\n  B. Lexical Analysis\n\
    \    addresses.  Other fields, such as \"Subject\"  and  \"Comments\",\n    are\
    \ regarded simply as strings of text.\n    NOTE:  Field-names, unstructured field\
    \ bodies and  structured\n    field  bodies  each  are  scanned  by  their own,\
    \ INDEPENDENT\n    \"lexical\" analyzer.\nc.  Field-names\n    To aid in the creation\
    \ and reading of field-names,  the  free\n    insertion  of  LWSP-chars  is  allowed\
    \ in  reasonable places.\n    Rather than obscuring the syntax specification for\
    \ field-name\n    with  the explicit syntax for these LWSP-chars, the existence\n\
    \    of a \"lexical\" analyzer is assumed.  The analyzer  interprets\n    the\
    \  text  which  comprises  the  field-name as a sequence of\n    field-name atoms\
    \ (fnatoms) separated by LWSP-chars\n    Note that ONLY LWSP-chars may occur between\
    \ the fnatoms of  a\n    field-name and that CRLFs may NOT.  In addition, comments\
    \ are\n    NOT lexically recognized, as such, but parenthesized  strings\n   \
    \ are  legal  as  part  of  field-names.  These constraints are\n    different\
    \ from what is permissible  within  structured  field\n    bodies.   In  particular,\
    \  this means that header field-names\n    must wholly occur on the FIRST line\
    \ of a folded  header  item\n    and may NOT be split across two or more lines.\n\
    d.  Unstructured field bodies\n    For  some  fields,  such  as  \"Subject\" \
    \ and  \"Comments\",  no\n    structuring is assumed; and they are treated simply\
    \ as texts,\n    like those in the message body.  Rules of  folding  apply  to\n\
    \    these  fields, so that such field bodies which occupy several\n    lines\
    \ must therefore have the  second  and  successive  lines\n    indented by at\
    \ least one LWSP-char.\ne.  Structured field bodies\n    To aid in the creation\
    \ and reading of structured fields,  the\n    free  insertion  of linear-white-space\
    \ (which permits folding\n    by inclusion of  CRLFs)  is  allowed  in  reasonable\
    \  places.\n    Rather  than  obscuring  the  syntax specifications for these\n\
    \    structured fields  with  explicit  syntax  for  this  linear-\n    white-space,\
    \  the  existence of another \"lexical\" analyzer is\n    assumed.  This analyzer\
    \ does not apply for field bodies which\n    are  simply unstructured strings\
    \ of text, as described above.\n    It provides an interpretation of the unfolded\
    \ text comprising\n    the  body  of  the  field  as  a sequence of lexical symbols.\n\
    \    These symbols are:\n  B. Lexical Analysis\n            -  comments\n    \
    \        -  atoms\n    The first three of these symbols are self-delimiting. \
    \  Atoms\n    are  not; they therefore are delimited by the self-delimiting\n\
    \    symbols and by linear-white-space.  For the purposes  of  re-\n    generating\
    \ sequences of atoms and quoted-strings, exactly one\n    SPACE is assumed to\
    \ exist and should be  used  between  them.\n    (Also,  in  Section  III.B.3.a,\
    \  note  the  rules  concerning\n    treatment of multiple continguous LWSP-chars.)\n\
    \    So, for example, the folded body of an address field\n            \":sysmail\"\
    @   Some-Host,\n            Muhammed(I am   the greatest)Ali   at(the)WBA\n  \
    \  is analyzed into the following lexical symbols and types:\n            \":sysmail\"\
    \              quoted string\n            @                       special\n  \
    \          Some-Host               atom\n            ,                       special\n\
    \            Muhammed                atom\n            (I am   the greatest) \
    \  comment\n            Ali                     atom\n            at         \
    \             atom\n            (the)                   comment\n            WBA\
    \                     atom\n    The cononical representations for the data in\
    \ these addresses\n    are  the  following  strings  (note that there is exactly\
    \ one\n    SPACE between words):\n                :sysmail at Some-Host\n    and\n\
    \                Muhammed Ali at WBA\n2.  Formal Definitions\nThe first four rules,\
    \ below, indicate a meta-syntax  for  fields,\nwithout  regard to their particular\
    \ type or internal syntax.  The\nremaining rules define basic syntactic structures\
    \ which are  used\nby the rules in Sections III.C, III.D, and III.E.\nfield  \

    3.  Clarifications\na.  \"White space\"\n    Remember that in field-names  and\
    \  structured  field  bodies,\n    MULTIPLE  LINEAR  WHITE SPACE TELNET ASCII\
    \ CHARACTERS (namely\n    HTABs and SPACEs) ARE TREATED AS SINGLE SPACES AND MAY\
    \ FREELY\n    SURROUND ANY SYMBOL.  In all header fields, the only place in\n\
    \    which at least one space is REQUIRED is at the  beginning  of\n    continuation\
    \  lines  in a folded field.  When passing text to\n    processes which do  not\
    \  interpret  text  according  to  this\n    standard  (e.g.,  ARPANET FTP mail\
    \ servers), then exactly one\n    SPACE should be used in place of arbitrary linear-white-space\n\
    \    and comment sequences.\n    WHEREVER A MEMBER OF THE LIST  OF  <DELIMITER>S\
    \  IS  ALLOWED,\n    LWSP-CHARS MAY ALSO OCCUR BEFORE AND/OR AFTER IT.\n    Writers\
    \ of mail-sending  (i.e.  header  generating)  programs\n    should  realize \
    \ that  there is no Network-wide definition of\n    the effect of horizontal-tab\
    \ TELNET ASCII characters  on  the\n    appearance  of  text  at another Network\
    \ host; therefore, the\n    use  of  tabs  in  message  headers,  though  permitted,\
    \   is\n    discouraged.\n    Note that  during  transmissions  across  the  ARPANET\
    \  using\n    TELNET  NVT  connections,  data  must  conform  to TELNET NVT\n\
    \    conventions (e.g., CR must be followed by either LF, making a\n    CRLF,\
    \ or <null>, if the CR is to stand alone).\nb.  Comments\n    Comments are detected\
    \ as such  only  within  field-bodies  of\n    structured  fields.   A  comment\
    \  is  a  set  of TELNET ASCII\n    characters, which is not within a quoted-string\
    \ and which  is\n    enclosed  in  matching parentheses; parentheses nest, so\
    \ that\n    if an unquoted left parenthesis occurs in a  comment  string,\n  \
    \  there  must  also  be  a  matching right parenthesis.  When a\n    comment\
    \ is used to act as the delimiter between a sequence of\n    two  lexical  symbols,\
    \  such  as  two  atoms, it is lexically\n    equivalent with one SPACE, for the\
    \ purposes  of  regenerating\n  B. Lexical Analysis\n    In particular comments\
    \ are NOT passed to the FTP  server,  as\n    part  of  a MAIL or MLFL command,\
    \ since comments are not part\n    of the \"formal\" address.\n    If a comment\
    \ is to be \"folded\" onto multiple lines, then  the\n    syntax for folding must\
    \ be adhered to.  (See items III.B.1.a,\n    above,  and  III.B.3.f,  below.)\
    \   Note  that  the   official\n    semantics therefore do not \"see\" any unquoted\
    \ CRLFs which are\n    in comments, although particular parsing programs may wish\
    \ to\n    note  their  presence.   For  these  programs,  it  would  be\n    reasonable\
    \ to interpret a \"CRLF LWSP-char\" as  being  a  CRLF\n    which  is part of\
    \ the comment; i.e., the CRLF is kept and the\n    LWSP-char is discarded.   Quoted\
    \  CRLFs  (i.e.,  a  backslash\n    followed  by a CR followed by a LF) still\
    \ must be followed by\n    at least one LWSP-char.\nc.  Delimiting and quoting\
    \ characters\n    The quote character (backslash) and characters which  delimit\n\
    \    syntactic units are not, generally, to be taken as data which\n    are part\
    \  of  the  delimited  or  quoted  unit(s).   The  one\n    exception is SPACE.\
    \  In particular, the quotation-marks which\n    define  a  quoted-string,  the\
    \  parentheses  which  define  a\n    comment  and the backslash which quotes\
    \ a following character\n    are  NOT  part  of  the  quoted-string,  comment\
    \  or   quoted\n    character.   A  quotation-mark  which  is  to  be  part  of\
    \ a\n    quoted-string, a parenthesis which is to be part of a comment\n    and\
    \  a  backslash  which is to be part of either must each be\n    preceded by the\
    \ quote-character backslash (\"\\\").   Note  that\n    the  syntax  allows  any\
    \  character  to  be  quoted  within a\n    quoted-string or comment;  however\
    \  only  certain  characters\n    MUST  be quoted to be included as data.  These\
    \ characters are\n    those which are not part of the alternate text  group  (i.e.,\n\
    \    ctext or qtext).\n    A single SPACE is assumed to exist between  contiguous\
    \  words\n    in  a  phrase,  and this interpretation is independent of the\n\
    \    actual number of LWSP-chars which the creator places  between\n    the  words.\
    \  To include more than one SPACE, the creator must\n    make the LWSP-chars be\
    \ part of a quoted-string.\n    Quotation marks which delimit a quoted string\
    \ and backslashes\n    which  quote the following character should NOT accompany\
    \ the\n    quoted-string when the string is used with processes that  do\n  B.\
    \ Lexical Analysis\nd.  Quoted-strings\n    Where   permitted  (i.e.,  in  words\
    \  in  structured  fields)\n    quoted-strings   are   treated   as  a  single\
    \  symbol  (i.e.\n    equivalent to an atom, syntactically).  If a quoted-string\
    \ is\n    to  be  \"folded\"  onto  multiple  lines,  then the syntax for\n  \
    \  folding must be adhered to.  (See items III.B.1.a, above, and\n    III.B.3.f,\
    \   below.)    Note   that  the  official  semantics\n    therefore do not \"\
    see\" any bare CRLFs which  are  in  quoted-\n    strings,  although  particular\
    \  parsing  programs may wish to\n    note  their  presence.   For  these  programs,\
    \  it  would  be\n    reasonable  to  interpret  a \"CRLF LWSP-char\" as being\
    \ a CRLF\n    which is part of the quoted-string; i.e., the  CRLF  is  kept\n\
    \    and  the  LWSP-char  is  discarded.   Quoted  CRLFs  (i.e., a\n    backslash\
    \ followed by a CR followed by a LF) are also subject\n    to  rules  of  folding,\
    \  but  the  presence  of  the  quoting\n    character (backslash) explicitly\
    \ indicates that the  CRLF  is\n    data to the quoted string.  Stripping off\
    \ the first following\n    LWSP-char is also appropriate when parsing quoted CRLFs.\n\
    e.  Bracketing characters\n    There are three types of brackets which must be\
    \ well nested:\n        o  Parentheses are used to indicate comments.\n      \
    \  o  Angle brackets (\"<\" and \">\") are  generally  used\n           to indicate\
    \ the presence of at least one machine-\n           usable code (e.g., delimiting\
    \ mailboxes).\n        o  Colon/semi-colon  (\":\"  and  \";\")  are   used  in\n\
    \           address   specifications  to  indicate  that  the\n           included\
    \ list of addresses are to be treated as a\n           group.\nf.  Case independence\
    \ of certain specials atoms\n    Certain atoms, which are represented in the syntax\
    \ as literal\n    alphabetic  strings, can be represented in any combination of\n\
    \    upper and lower case.  These are:\n        -  field-name,\n        -  \"\
    Include\", \"Postal\" and equivalent atoms in a\n           \":\"<atom>\":\" address\
    \ specification,\n        -  \"at\", in a host-indicator,\n        -  node,\n\
    \        -  day-of-week,\n        -  month, and\n        -  zones.\n  B. Lexical\
    \ Analysis\n    \"from\", and even \"FroM\" should all  be  treated  identically.\n\
    \    However,  the  case  shown in this specification is suggested\n    for message-creating\
    \ processes.  Note that, at the  level  of\n    this  specification,  case  IS\
    \  relevant  to  other words and\n    texts.  Also see Section IV.A.1.f, below.\n\
    g.  Folding long lines\n    Each header item (field of the message) may be represented\
    \ on\n    exactly  one line consisting of the name of the field and its\n    body;\
    \ this is what the parser sees.  For readability,  it  is\n    recommended  that\
    \ the field-body portion of long header items\n    be \"folded\" onto multiple\
    \ lines of the actual header.  \"Long\"\n    is  commonly  interpreted  to  mean\
    \  greater  than  65  or 72\n    characters.  The former length is recommended\
    \ as a limit, but\n    it is not imposed by this standard.\nh.  Backspace characters\n\
    \    Backspace TELNET ASCII characters (ASCII BS, decimal 8.)  may\n    be   included\
    \   in   texts   and   quoted-strings  to  effect\n    overstriking; however,\
    \ any use of backspaces which effects an\n    overstrike  to  the  left  of  the\
    \  beginning  of the text or\n    quoted-string is prohibited.\nC.  GENERAL SYNTAX\
    \ OF MESSAGES:\n    NOTE:  Due to an artifact of the notational conventions,\n\
    \           the  syntax indicates that, when present, \"Date\",\n           \"\
    From\", \"Sender\", and \"Reply-To\" fields  must  be\n           in  a  particular\
    \ order.  These header items must\n           be unique (occur exactly once).\
    \   However  header\n           fields, in fact, are NOT required to occur in\
    \ any\n           particular order, except that  the  message  body\n        \
    \   must  occur  AFTER  the headers.  For readability\n           and ease of\
    \ parsing  by  simple  systems,  it  is\n           recommended  that  headers\
    \  be  sent in the order\n           \"Date\", \"From\", \"Subject\", \"Sender\"\
    , \"To\",  \"cc\",\n           etc.    This   specification   permits   multiple\n\
    \           occurrences of  most  optional-fields.   However,\n           their\
    \  interpretation  is not specified here, and\n           their use is strongly\
    \ discouraged.\nThe following syntax for the bodies of various fields  should\
    \  be\nthought  of as describing each field body as a single long string\n(or\
    \ line).   The  section  on  Lexical  Analysis  (section  II.B)\n  C. Messages\n\

    A.  ADDRESS FIELDS\n1.  General\na.  The phrase part of a host-phrase in an address\
    \  specification\n    (i.e.,  the  host's name for the mailbox) is understood\
    \ to be\n    whatever the receiving FTP Server allows (for example,  TENEX\n \
    \   systems  do  not  now understand addresses of the form \"P. D.\n    Q. Bach\"\
    , but another system might).\n    Note that a mailbox is a conceptual  entity\
    \  which  does  not\n    necessarily pertain to file storage.  For example, some\
    \ sites\n    may choose to print mail on their line  printer  and  deliver\n \
    \   the output to the addressee's desk.\n    An individual may have  several \
    \ mailboxes  and  a  group  of\n    individuals  may wish to receive mail as a\
    \ single unit (i.e.,\n    a distribution list).  The second and third  alternatives\
    \  of\n    an  address  list  (#address)  allow  naming  a collection of\n   \
    \ subordinate  addresses  list(s).   Recipient  mailboxes   are\n    specified\
    \  within the bracketed part (\"<\" - \">\" or \":\" - \";\")\n    of such named\
    \ lists.  The use of angle-brackets (\"<\", \">\") is\n    intended for the cases\
    \ of individuals with multiple mailboxes\n    and of special mailbox lists; it\
    \ is not expected to be nested\n    more  than  one level, although the specification\
    \ allows such\n    nesting.  The use of colon/semi-colon (\":\", \";\") is  intended\n\
    \    for  the  case  of  groups.   Groups  can be expected to nest\n    (i.e.,\
    \ to  contain  subgroups).   For  both  individuals  and\n    groups,  a  copy\
    \  of the transmitted message is to be sent to\n    EACH mailbox  listed.   For\
    \  the  case  of  a  special  list,\n    treatment of addresses is defined in\
    \ the relevant subsections\n    of this section.\nb.  The inclusion of bare quoted-strings\
    \ as addresses (i.e.,  the\n    fourth  address-form  alternative)  is allowed\
    \ as a syntactic\n    convenience, but no semantics  are  defined  for  their\
    \  use.\n    However,  it is reasonable, when replicating an address list,\n \
    \   to replicate ALL of its members, including quoted-strings.\nc.  \":Include:\"\
    \ specifications are used to refer to one  or  more\n    locations  containing\
    \  stored  address  lists (#address).  If\n    more than one location is referenced,\
    \ the address part of the\n A. Address Fields\n    phrase; only they have any\
    \  meaning  within  this  construct.\n    The phrase part of indicated host-phrases\
    \ should contain text\n    which the referenced  host  can  resolve  to  a  file.\
    \   This\n    standard is not a protocol and so does not prescribe HOW data\n\
    \    is to be retrieved from the  file.   However,  the  following\n    requirements\
    \ are made:\n         o  The file must be accessible  through  the  local\n  \
    \          operating system interface (if it exists), given\n            adequate\
    \ user access rights; and\n         o  If a host has an FTP server and a user\
    \  is  able\n            to  retrieve  any files from the host using that\n  \
    \          server, then the file must be accessible through\n            FTP,\
    \  using  DEFAULT  transfer  settings,  given\n            adequate user access\
    \ rights.\n    It is intended that this mechanism allow programs to retrieve\n\
    \    such lists automatically.\n    The interpretation of such a file reference\
    \ follows.  This is\n    not  intended  to imply any particular implementation\
    \ scheme,\n    but is presented  to  aid  in  understanding  the  notion  of\n\
    \    including  file  contents in address lists:\n         o  Elements of the\
    \ address list part are alternates\n            and  the  contents of ONLY ONE\
    \ of them are to be\n            included in the resultant address list.\n   \
    \      o  The contents of the file indicated by  a  member\n            host-phrase\
    \  are  treated as an address list and\n            are inserted as an address\
    \  list  (#address)  in\n            the  position  of  the  path item in the\
    \ syntax.\n            That is, the TELNET ASCII characters  specifying\n    \
    \        the  entire Include <address> is replaced by the\n            contents\
    \ of one of the files to which the  host-\n            phrase(s),   of  the  address\
    \  list  (#address),\n            refers.  Therefore, the contents of  each  file,\n\
    \            indicated   by   an  Include  address,  must  be\n            syntactically\
    \ self-contained and must adhere  to\n            the full syntax prescribed herein\
    \ for an address\n            list.\nd.  \":Postal:\" specifications are used\
    \ to indicate (U.S.)  postal\n    addresses,  but  can  be  treated  the  same\
    \ as quoted-string\n    addresses.  To reference a list of postal addresses, the\
    \ list\n    must  conform  to  the  \"Individual  /  List\"  alternative of\n\
    \    <address>.  The \":Include:\" alternative also is valid.\n A. Address Fields\n\
    \    the  publishing  of  specifications  for these extended data-\n    types.\
    \  In the absence of defined semantics,  any  occurrence\n    of  an address in\
    \ this form may be treated as a quoted-string\n    address.\nf.  A node name must\
    \ be THE official name of a network or a host,\n    or  else  a decimal number\
    \ indicating the Network address for\n    that network or host, at the time  the\
    \  message  is  created.\n    The  USE  OF NUMBERS IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED and\
    \ is permitted\n    only due to the occasional necessity of bypassing local  name\n\
    \    tables.   For  the  ARPANET, official names are maintained by\n    the Network\
    \ Information Center at  SRI  International,  Menlo\n    Park, California.\n \
    \   Whenever a message might be transmitted or migrate to a  host\n    on  another\
    \  network,  full  hierarchical  addresses  must be\n    specified.   These  are\
    \  indicated  as  a  series  of  words,\n    separated  by at-sign or \"at\" indications.\
    \  The communication\n    environment is assumed to consist of a collection of\
    \ networks\n    organized  as  independent  \"trees\"  except  for  connections\n\
    \    between the root nodes.  That is, only the roots can  act  as\n    gateways\
    \  between  these  independent  networks.  While other\n    actual connections\
    \ may exist, it is believed  that  presuming\n    this  type of organization will\
    \ provide a reliable method for\n    describing VALID, if not EFFICIENT, paths\
    \ between  hosts.   A\n    typical full mailbox specification might therefore\
    \ look like:\n         Friendly User @ hosta @ local-net1 @ major-netq\n    In\
    \ the simplest case, a mail-sending host should transmit the\n    message  to\
    \ the node which is mentioned last (farthest to the\n    right), strip off that\
    \ node reference from the specification,\n    and then pass the remaining host-phrase\
    \ to the recipient host\n    (in  the  ARPANET,  its  FTP server) for it to process.\
    \  This\n    treats the remaining portion of the host-indicator merely  as\n \
    \   the terminating part of the phrase.\n         NOTE:  When passing any portion\
    \ of a host-indicator\n                onto a process which does not interpret\
    \ data\n                according to this  standard  (e.g.,  ARPANET\n       \
    \         FTP  servers), \"@\" must be used and not \"at\"\n                and\
    \ it must not be preceded or  followed  by\n                any  LWSP-chars. \
    \  Using  the above example,\n                the following string would be passed\
    \ to  the\n                major-netq gateway:\n                Friendly User@hosta@local-net1\n\
    \    When the sending host  has  more  knowledge  of  the  network\n A. Address\
    \ Fields\n    To use the above specification as an example:  If  a  sending\n\
    \    hostb  also were part of local-net1, then it could  send  the\n    message\
    \  directly  to  hosta  and  would give only the phrase\n    \"Friendly User\"\
    \ to hosta's mail-receiving program.  If  hostb\n    were  part  of  local-net2,\
    \ along with hostc, and happened to\n    know that hosta and hostc were  part\
    \  of  another  local-net,\n    then  hostb  could  send  the message to hostc\
    \ to the address\n    \"Friendly User@hosta\".\n    The phrase in a host-phrase\
    \ is intended to be meaningful only\n    to  the  indicated  receiving  host.\
    \  To all other hosts, the\n    phrase is to be treated as an uninterpreted string.\
    \  No  case\n    transformations  should  be  (automatically) performed on the\n\
    \    phrase.  The phrase  is  passed  to  the  local  host's  mail\n    sending\
    \  program; it is the responsibility of the destination\n    host's mail receiving\
    \ (distribution) program to perform  case\n    mapping on this phrase, if required,\
    \ to deliver the mail.\n2.  Originator Fields\n    WARNING:  The standard  allows\
    \  only  a  subset  of  the\n              combinations  possible  with the From,\
    \ Sender,\n              and  Reply-To  fields.   The   limitation   is\n    \
    \          intentional.\na.  From\n    This field contains the identity of the\
    \ person(s) who  wished\n    this message to be sent.  The message-creation process\
    \ should\n    default this field to be a single machine address, indicating\n\
    \    the AGENT (person or process) entering the message.  If  this\n    is  NOT\
    \  done, the \"Sender\" field MUST be present; if this IS\n    done, the \"Sender\"\
    \ field is optional.\nb.  Sender\n    This field contains  the  identity  of \
    \ the  AGENT (person or\n    process) who  sends the message.  It is intended\
    \ for use when\n    the sender is not the author of the message, or  to  indicate\n\
    \    who  among  a group of authors actually sent the message.  If\n    the contents\
    \  of  the  \"Sender\"  field  would  be  completely\n    redundant with the \"\
    From\" field, then the \"Sender\" field need\n    not be present and  its  use\
    \  is  discouraged  (though  still\n    legal);  in  particular,  the  \"Sender\"\
    \ field MUST be present\n    if it is NOT the same as the \"From\" Field.\n  \
    \  The  Sender  host-phrase  includes  a   phrase   which   must\n    correspond\
    \  to  a  specific  agent  (i.e.,  a human user or a\n A. Address Fields\n   \
    \ mail  and not simply include the name of a mailbox from which\n    the mail\
    \ was sent.  For example in the case of a shared login\n    name, the name, by\
    \ itself, would not be adequate.  The phrase\n    part of the host-phrase,  which\
    \  refers  to  this  agent,  is\n    expected  to be a computer system term, and\
    \ not (for example)\n    a generalized person reference which can be used outside\
    \  the\n    network text message context.\n    Since the critical function served\
    \ by the \"Sender\"  field  is\n    the  identification of the agent responsible\
    \ for sending mail\n    and since computer programs cannot be  held  accountable\
    \  for\n    their  behavior, is strongly recommended that when a computer\n  \
    \  program generates a message, the HUMAN who is responsible for\n    that  program\
    \  be  referenced  as  part of the \"Sender\" field\n    host-phrase.\nc.  Reply-To\n\
    \    This field provides a general mechanism  for  indicating  any\n    mailbox(es)\
    \ to which responses are to be sent.  Three typical\n    uses for this feature\
    \ can be  distinguished.   In  the  first\n    case,  the  author(s)  may  not\
    \  have  regular  machine-based\n    mailboxes and therefore wish(es)  to  indicate\
    \  an  alternate\n    machine  address.   In  the  second  case, an author may\
    \ wish\n    additional persons to be made aware of, or  responsible  for,\n  \
    \  responses;  responders  should  send  their  replies  to  the\n    \"Reply-To\"\
    \ mailbox(es) listed in  the  original  message.   A\n    somewhat  different\
    \  use may be of some help to \"text message\n    teleconferencing\" groups equipped\
    \ with automatic distribution\n    services:   include  the  address  of  that\
    \  service  in  the\n    \"Reply-To\"  field  of   all   messages   submitted\
    \   to   the\n    teleconference;  then  participants can \"reply\" to conference\n\
    \    submissions to guarantee  the  correct  distribution  of  any\n    submission\
    \ of their own.\n    Reply-To fields are  NOT  required  to  contain  any  machine\n\
    \    addresses  (i.e., host-phrases).   Note,  however,  that  the\n    absence\
    \  of even one  valid  network  address  will  tend  to\n    prevent  software\
    \  systems from automatically assisting users\n    in conveniently responding\
    \ to mail.\nNOTE:  For systems which automatically generate address lists for\n\
    replies to messages, the following recommendations are made:\n     o  The receiver,\
    \ when replying  to  a  message,  should\n        NEVER automatically include\
    \ the \"Sender\" host-phrase\n        in the reply's address list;\n     o  If\

    \    examples  are  provided  in   Section   V.)    This\nrecommendation  is intended\
    \ only for originator-fields and is not\nintended to suggest that replies should\
    \ not also be sent  to  the\nother  recipients  of  this  message.  It is up to\
    \ the respective\nmail handling programs to decide what additional facilities\
    \  will\nbe provided.\n3.  Receiver Fields\na.  To\n    This field contains the\

    \ the message  sent  to  the  primary  and  secondary\n    recipients.   Some\
    \  systems may choose to include the text of\n    the \"Bcc\" field only in the\
    \ author(s)'s  copy,  while  others\n    may  also  include it in the text sent\
    \ to all those indicated\n    in the \"Bcc\" list.\nB.  REFERENCE SPECIFICATION\
    \ FIELDS\n1.  Message-ID\nThis field contains a unique identifier (the phrase)\
    \ which refers\nto  THIS  version of THIS message.  The uniqueness of the message\n\
    identifier is guaranteed by the host which  generates  it.   This\nidentifier\
    \ is intended to be machine readable and not necessarily\nmeaningful to humans.\
    \  A message identifier pertains  to  exactly\none  instantiation  of a particular\

    \ format.\n4.  Keywords\nThis field contains keywords or phrases, separated by\
    \ commas.\nC.  OTHER FIELDS AND SYNTACTIC ITEMS\n1.  Subject\nThe \"Subject\"\
    \ field is intended to provide as much information as\nnecessary  to  adequately\
    \ summarize or indicate the nature of the\nmessage.\n2.  Comments\nPermits adding\
    \ text comments onto the message without  disturbing\nthe contents of the message's\
    \ body.\n3.  Extension-field\nA relatively limited number of common fields have\
    \ been defined in\nthis  document.  As network mail requirements dictate, additional\n\
    fields may be standardized.  The authors of  this  document  will\nregulate  the\
    \ publishing of such definitions as extensions to the\nbasic specification.\n\
    4.  User-defined-field\nIndividual users of network mail  are  free  to  define\
    \  and  use\nadditional  header fields.  Such fields must have names which are\n\
    not  already  used  in  the  current  specification  or  in   any\ndefinitions\
    \  of extension-fields, and the overall syntax of these\nuser-defined-fields must\
    \ conform to  this  specification's  rules\nfor  delimiting and  folding  fields.\
    \  Due to the extension-field\npublishing process, the name of a user-defined-field\
    \ may be  pre-\nempted.\n D. Dates\nD.  DATES AND TIMES\nIf included, day-of-week\
    \ must be the  day  implied  by  the  date\nspecification.\nTime zone  may  be\
    \  indicated  in  several  ways.   The  military\nstandard   uses  a  single \
    \ character  for  each  zone.   \"Z\"  is\nGreenwhich Mean Time; \"A\" indicates\
    \ one  hour  earlier,  and  \"M\"\nindicates  12 hours earlier; \"N\" is one hour\
    \ later, and \"Y\" is 12\nhours later.  The letter \"J\" is not used.   The  other\
    \  remaining\ntwo  forms  are  taken from ANSI standard X3.51-1975.  One allows\n\
    explicit indication of the amount of offset from GMT;  the  other\nA. Addresses\n\

    \ have  identical  semantics,\nas  far  as  the  operation  of  the  local  host's\
    \  mail sending\n(distribution) program (also sometimes called its  \"mailer\"\
    )  and\nthe  remote  host's  FTP  server  are  concerned.   In  the first\nexample,\
    \ the \"Alfred E. Neuman\" is  ignored  by  the  mailer,  as\n\"Neuman  at  BBN-TENEXA\"\
    \ completely specifies the recipient.  The\nsecond example contains no superfluous\
    \ information,  and,  again,\n\"Neuman@BBN-TENEXA\" is the intended recipient.\n\
    3.  Al Neuman at BBN-TENEXA\nThis is identical to \"Al Neuman <Al Neuman at BBN-TENEXA>\"\
    .  That\nis,  the  full  phrase, \"Al Neuman\", is passed to the FTP server.\n\
    Note that not all FTP servers accept multi-word identifiers;  and\nsome  that\
    \  do  accept  them  will treat each word as a different\naddressee (in this case,\
    \ attempting to send a copy of the message\nto \"Al\" and a copy to \"Neuman\"\
    ).\n4.  \"George Lovell, Ted Hackle\" <Shared-Mailbox at Office-1>\nThis form\
    \ might be used to indicate  that  a  single  mailbox  is\nshared  by  several\
    \  users.   The quoted string is ignored by the\noriginating  host's  mailer,\
    \  as  \"Shared-Mailbox  at   Office-1\"\ncompletely specifies the destination\
    \ mailbox.\n4.  Wilt (the Stilt) Chamberlain at NBA\nThe \"(the Stilt)\" is a\
    \ comment, which  is  NOT  included  in  the\ndestination  mailbox  address  handed\
    \ to the originating system's\nmailer.  The  address  is  the  string  \"Wilt\

    \ Jones' secretary sends mail for George in his capacity  as\na  member  of  Group\
    \  while  logged  in as Secy at Host.  Replies\nshould go to Group.\n    From:\

    \ not be a space between \"Jones\" and the  \"<\",\nbut  adding a space enhances\

    \ agent of author\nGeorge Jones asks his secretary (Secy at Host) to send a  message\n\
    for  him  in  his  capacity  as Group.  He wants his secretary to\nhandle all\

    \         From:   George Jones\n         Sender: Secy at SHost\nTHIS IS NOT PERMITTED.\
    \  Replies are NEVER implicitly sent to  the\n\"Sender\";  George's  secretary\
    \  should  have  used the \"Reply-To\"\nfield, or the  mail  creating  program\
    \  should  have  forced  the\nsecretary to.\n9.  Agent for member of a committee\n\
    George's secretary sends out a message which was authored jointly\nby all the\

    \  SIMPLE PARSING\n     Some mail-reading software systems may wish to perform\
    \  only\nminimal  processing,  ignoring  the internal syntax of structured\nfield-bodies\
    \ and treating them the  same  as  unstructured-field-\nbodies.  Such software\
    \ will need only to distinguish:\n     -  Header fields from the message body,\n\
    \     -  Beginnings of fields from lines which continue fields,\n     -  Field-names\
    \ from field-contents.\n     The abbreviated set of syntactic rules  which  follows\
    \  will\nsuffice  for  this  purpose.   They  describe  a  limited view of\nmessages\
    \ and are a subset of the syntactic rules provided in  the\nmain part of this\
    \ specification.  One small exception is that the\ncontents of field-bodies consist\
    \ only of text:\nSYNTAX:\nmessage         =  *field *(CRLF *text)\nfield     \
    \      =  field-name \":\" [field-body] CRLF\nfield-name      =  fnatom *( LWSP-char\

    >\nfield-body      =  *text [CRLF LWSP-char field-body]\nSEMANTICS:\n     Headers\
    \ occur before the message body and are terminated  by\na null line (i.e., two\
    \ contiguous CRLFs).\n     A line which continues a header field begins with a\
    \ SPACE or\nHTAB  character,  while  a  line  beginning a field starts with a\n\
    printable character which is not a colon.\n     A field-name consists of one or\
    \  more  printable  characters\n(excluding colon), each separated by one or more\
