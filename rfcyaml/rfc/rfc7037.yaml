  - "Abstract\n   The DHCPv6 RADIUS option provides a mechanism to exchange\n   authorization
    and identification information between the DHCPv6 relay\n   agent and DHCPv6 server.
    \ This architecture assumes that the Network\n   Access Server (NAS) acts as both
    a DHCPv6 relay agent and RADIUS\n   client.  When receiving messages from the
    DHCPv6 clients, the NAS\n   consults the RADIUS server and adds the RADIUS response
    when\n   forwarding the DHCPv6 client's messages to the DHCPv6 server.  The\n
    \  DHCPv6 server then uses that additional information to generate an\n   appropriate
    response to the DHCPv6 client's requests.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   DHCPv6 provides a mechanism that allows the server to assign
    or\n   delegate both stateful and stateless configuration parameters to\n   clients.
    \ The stateful configuration parameters include IPv6\n   addresses [RFC3315] and
    IPv6 prefixes [RFC3633].  The stateless\n   configuration parameters [RFC3736]
    include, for example, DNS\n   [RFC3646], or a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
    of an Address\n   Family Transition Router (AFTR) [RFC6334].  In the scenarios\n
    \  described in this document, the DHCPv6 server is deployed in the\n   central
    part of an ISP network.\n   RADIUS [RFC2865] is widely used as the centralized
    authentication,\n   authorization, and user management mechanism for service provision
    in\n   a Broadband access network.  [RFC3162], [RFC4818], [RFC6519], and\n   [RFC6911]
    specify the attributes that support the service provision\n   for IPv6-only and
    IPv6-transition access.  The RADIUS server\n   authorizes the Network Access Server
    (NAS) to assign an IPv6 address\n   or prefix from the indicated pool, or to assign
    an IPv6 address or\n   prefix with an explicitly indicated value, and to indicate
    other\n   configuration parameters as per the RADIUS attributes for the\n   subscribers.\n
    \  When the NAS acts as the distributed DHCPv6 server and RADIUS client\n   simultaneously,
    it communicates with the RADIUS server after\n   receiving a request from the
    DHCPv6 client.  Upon receiving the\n   Access-Accept message from the RADIUS server,
    the NAS then responds\n   to the DHCPv6 client's requests per the associated authorization\n
    \  information indicated by the RADIUS attributes in the Access-Accept\n   message.
    \ When NAS acts as the DHCPv6 relay agent and RADIUS client\n   simultaneously,
    and the centralized DHCPv6 server is co-located with\n   the RADIUS server, they
    may share the same database of users.\n   However, when the centralized DHCPv6
    server is not located in the\n   same place as the RADIUS server, a new communication
    mechanism is\n   needed for the DHCPv6 relay agent to transfer the authorization\n
    \  information indicated by the RADIUS attributes to the DHCPv6 server.\n"

    where the\n   communication mechanism introduced in this document is necessary.
    \ In\n   these scenarios, the centralized DHCPv6 server is not co-located with\n
    \  the RADIUS server, but both are in the same administrative domain.\n   The
    NAS acts as the DHCPv6 relay agent and the RADIUS client\n   simultaneously.  Figure
    1 shows the sequence of DHCPv6 and RADIUS\n   messages for the IP over Ethernet
    (IPoE) access model, when the\n   access loop adopts the direct Ethernet encapsulation.
    \ Figure 2 shows\n   the sequence of DHCPv6 and RADIUS messages for the PPP over
    Ethernet\n   (PPPoE) access model.\n   The mechanism introduced in this document
    is a generic mechanism and\n   might also be employed in other network scenarios
    where the DHCPv6\n   relay agent and the RADIUS client are located in the same
    device.\n   +-------+                   +-------+                    +-------+\n

  - "6.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior\n   Upon receipt of the RELAY-FORW (12) message with
    OPTION_RADIUS from a\n   relay agent, the DHCPv6 server that supports OPTION_RADIUS
    SHOULD\n   extract and interpret the RADIUS attributes in the OPTION_RADIUS and\n
    \  use that information to select configuration parameters for the\n   requesting
    client.  If the DHCPv6 server does not support\n   OPTION_RADIUS, the DHCPv6 server
    MUST silently discard this option.\n"

  - "7.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior\n   OPTION_RADIUS is only exchanged between the relay
    agents and the\n   servers.  DHCPv6 clients are not aware of the usage of OPTION_RADIUS.\n
    \  DHCPv6 clients MUST NOT send OPTION_RADIUS and MUST ignore\n   OPTION_RADIUS
    if received.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Known security vulnerabilities of the DHCPv6
    and RADIUS protocols may\n   apply to their options.  Security issues related
    with DHCPv6 are\n   described in Section 23 of [RFC3315].  Security issues related
    with\n   RADIUS are described in Section 8 of [RFC2865], Section 5 of\n   [RFC3162],
    and Section 11 of [RFC6929].\n   The mechanism described in this document may
    introduce a new attack\n   vector against the DHCPv6 server in cases where the
    DHCPv6 relay\n   agent is compromised.  By forging the RADIUS attributes contained
    in\n   the OPTION_RADIUS of the RELAY-FORW (12) messages, the attacker may\n   influence
    the parameter assignment on the DHCPv6 server for the\n   DHCPv6 clients.  However,
    as described in the Section 3, NAS always\n   belongs to the same administrative
    domain of the DHCPv6 server in the\n   real deployment.\n   Network administrators
    should be aware that although RADIUS messages\n   are encrypted, DHCPv6 messages
    are always unencrypted.  It is\n   possible that some RADIUS vendor-specific attributes
    might contain\n   sensitive or confidential information.  Network administrators
    are\n   strongly advised to prevent such information from being included in\n
    \  DHCPv6 messages.\n   If the use of vendor-specific attributes with confidential
    content is\n   required, administrators are advised to use IPsec with encryption
    to\n   protect the confidentiality of the RADIUS attributes.  Relay agents\n   and
    servers implementing this specification MUST support the use of\n   IPsec Encapsulating
    Security Payload (ESP) with encryption in\n   transport mode, according to Section
    3.1.1 of [RFC4303] and\n   Section 21.1 of [RFC3315].\n"

  - "9.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has assigned OPTION_RADIUS (81) in the \"DHCP
    Option Codes\"\n   registry, as defined in Section 4.  In addition, IANA has created
    a\n   new registry entitled \"RADIUS Attributes Permitted in DHCPv6 RADIUS\n   Option\"
    in the \"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6\n   (DHCPv6)\" registry,
    as defined in Section 4.1.  The new registry\n   enumerates the RADIUS Attributes
    Types\n   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types) that are permitted for\n
    \  inclusion in the DHCPv6 RADIUS option.  The allocation policy of this\n   \"RADIUS
    Attributes Permitted in DHCPv6 RADIUS Option\" registry is\n   Expert Review per
    [RFC5226].  Designated experts should carefully\n   consider the security implications
    of allowing the relay agent to\n   include new RADIUS attributes to this registry.\n"
