  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a 224-bit one-way hash function,\
    \ called\n   SHA-224.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\n\
    \   announced the FIPS 180-2 Change Notice on February 28, 2004 which\n   specifies\
    \ the SHA-224 one-way hash function.  One-way hash functions\n   are also known\
    \ as message digests.  SHA-224 is based on SHA-256, the\n   256-bit one-way hash\
    \ function already specified by NIST [SHA2].\n   Computation of a SHA-224 hash\
    \ value is two steps.  First, the SHA-256\n   hash value is computed, except that\
    \ a different initial value is\n   used.  Second, the resulting 256-bit hash value\
    \ is truncated to 224\n   bits.\n   NIST is developing guidance on cryptographic\
    \ key management, and NIST\n   recently published a draft for comment [NISTGUIDE].\
    \  Five security\n   levels are discussed in the guidance: 80, 112, 128, 192,\
    \ and 256 bits\n   of security.  One-way hash functions are available for all\
    \ of these\n   levels except one.  SHA-224 fills this void.  SHA-224 is a one-way\n\
    \   hash function that provides 112 bits of security, which is the\n   generally\
    \ accepted strength of Triple-DES [3DES].\n   This document makes the SHA-224\
    \ one-way hash function specification\n   available to the Internet community,\
    \ and it publishes the object\n   identifiers for use in ASN.1-based protocols.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Usage Considerations
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Usage Considerations\n   Since SHA-224 is based on SHA-256, roughly the\
    \ same amount of effort\n   is consumed to compute a SHA-224 or a SHA-256 digest\
    \ message digest\n   value.  Even though SHA-224 and SHA-256 have roughly equivalent\n\
    \   computational complexity, SHA-224 is an appropriate choice for a\n   one-way\
    \ hash function that provides 112 bits of security.  The use of\n   a different\
    \ initial value ensures that a truncated SHA-256 message\n   digest value cannot\
    \ be mistaken for a SHA-224 message digest value\n   computed on the same data.\n\
    \   Some usage environments are sensitive to every octet that is\n   transmitted.\
    \  In these cases, the smaller (by 4 octets) message\n   digest value provided\
    \ by SHA-224 is important.\n   These observations lead to the following guidance:\n\
    \   *  When selecting a suite of cryptographic algorithms that all offer\n   \
    \   112 bits of security strength, SHA-224 is an appropriate choice\n      for\
    \ one-way hash function.\n   *  When terseness is not a selection criteria, the\
    \ use of SHA-256 is\n      a preferred alternative to SHA-224.\n"

- title: 2.  SHA-224 Description
  contents:
  - "2.  SHA-224 Description\n   SHA-224 may be used to compute a one-way hash value\
    \ on a message\n   whose length less than 2^64 bits.\n   SHA-224 makes use of\
    \ SHA-256 [SHA2].  To compute a one-way hash\n   value, SHA-256 uses a message\
    \ schedule of sixty-four 32-bit words,\n   eight 32-bit working variables, and\
    \ produces a hash value of eight\n   32-bit words.\n   The function is defined\
    \ in the exact same manner as SHA-256, with the\n   following two exceptions:\n\
    \      First, for SHA-224, the initial hash value of the eight 32-bit\n      working\
    \ variables, collectively called H, shall consist of the\n      following eight\
    \ 32-bit words (in hex):\n         H_0 = c1059ed8               H_4 = ffc00b31\n\
    \         H_1 = 367cd507               H_5 = 68581511\n         H_2 = 3070dd17\
    \               H_6 = 64f98fa7\n         H_3 = f70e5939               H_7 = befa4fa4\n\
    \      Second, SHA-224 simply makes use of the first seven 32-bit words\n    \
    \  in the SHA-256 result, discarding the remaining 32-bit words in\n      the\
    \ SHA-256 result.  That is, the final value of H is used as\n      follows, where\
    \ || denotes concatenation:\n         H_0 || H_1 || H_2 || H_3 || H_4 || H_5 ||\
    \ H_6\n"

    \ hash\n   functions.  One example is CMS [CMS].  Implementations of such\n  \

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   One-way hash functions are typically used with\
    \ other cryptographic\n   algorithms, such as digital signature algorithms and\
    \ keyed-hash\n   message authentication codes, or in the generation of random\
    \ values.\n   When a one-way hash function is used in conjunction with another\n\
    \   algorithm, there may be requirements specified elsewhere that require\n  \
    \ the use of a one-way hash function with a certain number of bits of\n   security.\
    \  For example, if a message is being signed with a digital\n   signature algorithm\
    \ that provides 128 bits of security, then that\n   signature algorithm may require\
    \ the use of a one-way hash algorithm\n   that also provides the same number of\
    \ bits of security.  SHA-224 is\n   intended to provide 112 bits of security,\
    \ which is the generally\n   accepted strength of Triple-DES [3DES].\n   This\
    \ document is intended to provide the SHA-224 specification to the\n   Internet\
    \ community.  No independent assertion of the security of this\n   one-way hash\
    \ function is intended by the author for any particular\n   use.  However, as\
    \ long as SHA-256 provides the expected security,\n   SHA-224 will also provide\
    \ its expected level of security.\n"
