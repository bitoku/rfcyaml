  - "                       IMPSYS Change Notification\n        We will shortly install\
    \ (or perhaps will have already\n   installed) a new version of the IMP system,\
    \ Version 2513.  The\n   new version incorporates two principal changes:\n   \
    \  1.  A Host will be prevented from sending any messages\n         into the Network\
    \ for between 40 seconds and a\n         minute and a quarter after he comes alive\
    \ (this\n         has been changed from between 30 seconds and a\n         minute).\n\
    \     2.  The IMP has been given the ability to test its Host\n         interfaces\
    \ under control of the NCC.  This will help\n         us isolate the trouble when\
    \ the IMP Host communication\n         path is faulty.\n     BC/jm\n       [ This\
    \ RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online\
