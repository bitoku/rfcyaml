  - "1.  Introduction\n   There has been significant recent work in increasing the\
    \ capabilities\n   of Ethernet switches.  As a consequence, the role of Ethernet\
    \ is\n   rapidly expanding into \"transport networks\" that previously were the\n\
    \   domain of other technologies such as SONET/SDH, TDM, and ATM.  The\n   evolution\
    \ and development of Ethernet capabilities in these areas is\n   a very active\
    \ and ongoing process.\n   Multiple organizations have been active in extending\
    \ Ethernet\n   technology to support transport networks.  This activity has taken\n\
    \   place in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)\n  \
    \ 802.1 Working Group, the International Telecommunication Union -\n   Telecommunication\
    \ Standardization Sector (ITU-T) and the Metro\n   Ethernet Forum (MEF).  These\
    \ groups have been focusing on Ethernet\n   forwarding, Ethernet management plane\
    \ extensions, and the Ethernet\n   Spanning Tree Control Plane, but not on an\
    \ explicitly routed,\n   constraint-based control plane.\n   In the forwarding-plane\
    \ context, extensions have been, or are being,\n   defined to support different\
    \ transport Ethernet forwarding models,\n   protection modes, and service interfaces.\
    \  Examples of such\n   extensions include [802.1ah], [802.1Qay], [G.8011], and\
    \ [MEF.6].\n   These extensions allow for greater flexibility in the Ethernet\n\
    \   forwarding plane and, in some cases, the extensions allow for a\n   departure\
    \ from forwarding based on a spanning tree.  For example, in\n   the [802.1ah]\
    \ case, greater flexibility in forwarding is achieved\n   through the addition\
    \ of a \"provider\" address space.  [802.1Qay]\n   supports the use of provisioning\
    \ systems and network control\n   protocols that explicitly select traffic-engineered\
    \ paths.\n   This document provides a framework for GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching\n\
    \   (GELS).  GELS will likely require more than one switching type to\n   support\
    \ the different models, and as the GMPLS procedures that will\n   need to be extended\
    \ are dependent on switching type, these will be\n   covered in the technology-specific\
    \ documents.\n   In the provider bridge model developed in the IEEE 802.1ad project\n\
    \   and amended to the IEEE 802.1Q standard [802.1Q], an extra Virtual\n   Local\
    \ Area Network (VLAN) identifier (VID) is added.  This VID is\n   referred to\
    \ as the Service VID (S-VID) and is carried in a Service\n   TAG (S-TAG).  In\
    \ Provider Backbone Bridges (PBBs) [802.1ah], a\n   Backbone VID (B-VID) and B-MAC\
    \ header with a service instance (I-TAG)\n   encapsulate a customer Ethernet frame\
    \ or a service Ethernet frame.\n   In the IEEE 802.1Q standard, the terms Provider\
    \ Backbone Bridges\n   (PBBs) and Provider Backbone Bridged Network (PBBN) are\
    \ used in the\n   context of these extensions.\n   An example of Ethernet protection\
    \ extensions can be found in\n   [G.8031].  Ethernet operations, administration,\
    \ and maintenance (OAM)\n   is another important area that is being extended to\
    \ enable provider\n   Ethernet services.  Related extensions can be found in [802.1ag]\
    \ and\n   [Y.1731].\n   An Ethernet-based service model is being defined within\
    \ the context\n   of the MEF and ITU-T.  [MEF.6] and [G.8011] provide parallel\n\
    \   frameworks for defining network-oriented characteristics of Ethernet\n   services\
    \ in transport networks.  These framework documents discuss\n   general Ethernet\
    \ connection characteristics, Ethernet User-Network\n   Interfaces (UNIs), and\
    \ Ethernet Network-Network Interfaces (NNIs).\n   [G.8011.1] defines the Ethernet\
    \ Private Line (EPL) service, and\n   [G.8011.2] defines the Ethernet Virtual\
    \ Private Line (EVPL) service.\n   [MEF.6] covers both service types.  These activities\
    \ are consistent\n   with the types of Ethernet switching defined in [802.1ah].\n\
    \   The Ethernet forwarding-plane and management-plane extensions allow\n   for\
    \ the disabling of standard Spanning Tree Protocols but do not\n   define an explicitly\
    \ routed, constraint-based control plane.  For\n   example, [802.1Qay] is an amendment\
    \ to IEEE 802.1Q that explicitly\n   allows for traffic engineering of Ethernet\
    \ forwarding paths.\n   The IETF's GMPLS work provides a common control plane\
    \ for different\n   data-plane technologies for Internet and telecommunication\
    \ service\n   providers.  The GMPLS architecture is specified in RFC 3945\n  \
    \ [RFC3945].  The protocols specified for GMPLS can be used to control\n   \"\
    Transport Network\" technologies, e.g., optical and TDM networks.\n   GMPLS can\
    \ also be used for packet and Layer 2 Switching (frame/cell-\n   based networks).\n\
    \   This document provides a framework for the use of GMPLS to control\n   \"\
    transport\" Ethernet Label Switched Paths (Eth-LSPs).  Transport\n   Ethernet\
    \ adds new constraints that require it to be distinguished\n   from the previously\
    \ specified technologies for GMPLS.  Some\n   additional extensions to the GMPLS\
    \ control plane are needed, and this\n   document provides a framework for these\
    \ extensions.  All extensions\n   to support Eth-LSPs will build on the GMPLS\
    \ architecture and related\n   specifications.\n   This document introduces and\
    \ explains GMPLS control plane use for\n   transport Ethernet and the concept\
    \ of the Eth-LSP.  The data-plane\n   aspects of Eth-LSPs are outside the scope\
    \ of this document and IETF\n   activities.\n   The intent of this document is\
    \ to reuse and be aligned with as much\n   of the GMPLS protocols as possible.\
    \  For example, reusing the IP\n   control-plane addressing allows existing signaling,\
    \ routing, Link\n   Management Protocol (LMP), and path computation to be used\
    \ as\n   specified.  The GMPLS protocols support hierarchical LSPs as well as\n\
    \   contiguous LSPs.  Also, GMPLS protocol mechanisms support a variety\n   of\
    \ network reference points from UNIs to NNIs.  Additions to existing\n   GMPLS\
    \ capabilities will only be made to accommodate features unique\n   to transport\
    \ Ethernet.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.1.  Concepts\n   The following are basic Ethernet and GMPLS terms:\n   o\
    \ Asymmetric Bandwidth\n     This term refers to a property of a bidirectional\
    \ service instance\n     that has differing bandwidth allocation in each direction.\n\
    \   o Bidirectional congruent LSP\n     This term refers to the property of a\
    \ bidirectional LSP that uses\n     only the same nodes, ports, and links in both\
    \ directions.  Ethernet\n     data planes are normally bidirectional congruent\
    \ (sometimes known\n     as reverse path congruent).\n   o Contiguous Eth-LSP\n\
    \     A contiguous Eth-LSP is an end-to-end Eth-LSP that is formed from\n    \
    \ multiple Eth-LSPs, each of which is operating within a VLAN and is\n     mapped\
    \ one-to-one at the VLAN boundaries.  Stitched LSPs form\n     contiguous LSPs.\n\
    \   o Eth-LSP\n     This term refers to Ethernet Label Switched Paths that may\
    \ be\n     controlled via GMPLS.\n   o Hierarchical Eth-LSP\n     Hierarchical\
    \ Eth-LSPs create a hierarchy of Eth-LSPs.\n   o In-band GMPLS signaling\n   \
    \  In-band GMPLS signaling is composed of IP-based control messages\n     that\
    \ are sent on the native Ethernet links encapsulated by a\n     single-hop Ethernet\
    \ header.  Logical links that use a dedicated VID\n     on the same physical links\
    \ would be considered in-band signaling.\n   o Out-of-band GMPLS signaling\n \
    \    Out-of-band GMPLS signaling is composed of IP-based control\n     messages\
    \ that are sent between Ethernet switches over links other\n     than the links\
    \ used by the Ethernet data plane.  Out-of-band\n     signaling typically shares\
    \ a different fate from the data links.\n   o Point-to-point (P2P) Traffic Engineering\
    \ (TE) service instance\n     A TE service instance made up of a single bidirectional\
    \ P2P or two\n     P2P unidirectional Eth-LSPs.\n   o Point-to-multipoint (P2MP)\
    \ Traffic Engineering (TE) service\n     instance\n     A TE service instance\
    \ supported by a set of LSPs that comprises one\n     P2MP LSP from a root to\
    \ n leaves, plus a bidirectional congruent\n     point-to-point (P2P) LSP from\
    \ each of the leaves to the root.\n   o Shared forwarding\n     Shared forwarding\
    \ is a property of a data path where a single\n     forwarding entry (VID + Destination\
    \ MAC address) may be used for\n     frames from multiple sources (Source MAC\
    \ addresses).  Shared\n     forwarding does not change any data-plane behavior.\
    \  Shared\n     forwarding saves forwarding database (FDB) entries only.  Shared\n\
    \     forwarding offers similar benefits to merging in the data plane.\n     However,\
    \ in shared forwarding, the Ethernet data packets are\n     unchanged.  With shared\
    \ forwarding, dedicated control-plane states\n     for all Eth-LSPs are maintained\
    \ regardless of shared forwarding\n     entries.\n"

    \                Figure 1: Ethernet Switching Service Types\n   The switching\
    \ types are defined in Clause 25 of [802.1ah].  While not\n   specifically described\
    \ in [802.1ah], the Ethernet services being\n   defined in the context of [MEF.6]\
    \ and [G.8011] also fall into the\n   types defined in Figure 1 (with the exception\
    \ of the newly defined\n   I-tagged service type).\n   [802.1ah] defines a new\
    \ I-tagged service type but does not\n   specifically define the Ethernet services\
    \ being defined in the\n   context of [MEF.6] and [G.8011], which are also illustrated\
    \ in Figure\n   1.\n   To summarize the definitions:\n   o Port based\n     This\
    \ is a frame-based service that supports specific frame types;\n     no Service\
    \ VLAN tagging or MAC-address-based switching.\n   o S-tagged\n     There are\
    \ multiple S-TAG-aware services, including:\n     + one-to-one\n       In this\
    \ service, each VLAN identifier (VID) is mapped into a\n       different service.\n\
    \     + bundled\n       Bundled S-tagged service supports the mapping of multiple\
    \ VIDs\n       into a single service and includes:\n       * many-to-one\n   \
    \      In this frame-based service, multiple VIDs are mapped into the\n      \
    \   same service.\n       * all-to-one\n         In this frame-based service,\
    \ all VIDs are mapped into the same\n         service.\n         - transparent\n\
    \           This is a special case, all frames are mapped from a single\n    \
    \       incoming port to a single destination Ethernet port.\n   o I-tagged\n\
    \     The edge of a PBBN consists of a combined backbone relay\n     (B-component\
    \ relay) and service instance relay (I-component relay).\n     An I-TAG contains\
    \ a service identifier (24-bit I-SID) and priority\n     markings as well as some\
    \ other fields.  An I-tagged service is\n     typically between the edges of the\
    \ PBBN and terminated at each edge\n     on an I-component that faces a customer\
    \ port so the service is\n     often not visible except at the edges.  However,\
    \ since the\n     I-component relay involves a distinct relay, it is possible\
    \ to have\n     a visible I-tagged Service by separating the I-component relay\
    \ from\n     the B-component relay.  Two examples where it makes sense to do\n\
    \     this are an I-tagged service between two PBBNs and as an attachment\n  \
    \   to a customer's Provider Instance Port.\n   In general, the different switching\
    \ types determine which of the\n   Ethernet header fields are used in the forwarding/switching\
    \ function,\n   e.g., VID only or VID and DMACs.  The switching type may also\
    \ require\n   the use of additional Ethernet headers or fields.  Services defined\n\
    \   for UNIs tend to use the headers for requesting service (service\n   delimiter)\
    \ and are relevant between the customer site and network\n   edge.\n   In most\
    \ bridging cases, the header fields cannot be changed, but some\n   translations\
    \ of VID field values are permitted, typically at the\n   network edges.\n   Across\
    \ all service types, the Ethernet data plane is bidirectional\n   congruent. \
    \ This means that the forward and reverse paths share the\n   exact same set of\
    \ nodes, ports, and bidirectional links.  This\n   property is fundamental.  The\
    \ 802.1 group has maintained this\n   bidirectional congruent property in the\
    \ definition of Connectivity\n   Fault Management (CFM), which is part of the\
    \ overall OAM capability.\n"

- title: 2.3.  Ethernet Switching Characteristics
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Ethernet Switching Characteristics\n   Ethernet is similar to MPLS as it\
    \ encapsulates different packet and\n   frame types for data transmission.  In\
    \ Ethernet, the encapsulated\n   data is referred to as MAC client data.  The\
    \ encapsulation is an\n   Ethernet MAC frame with a header, a source address,\
    \ a destination\n   address, and an optional VLAN identifier, type, and length\
    \ on the\n   front of the MAC client data with optional padding and a Frame Check\n\
    \   Sequence at the end of the frame.\n   The type of MAC client data is typically\
    \ identified by an \"Ethertype\"\n   value.  This is an explicit type indication,\
    \ but Ethernet also\n   supports an implicit type indication.\n   Ethernet bridging\
    \ switches based on a frame's destination MAC address\n   and VLAN.  The VLAN\
    \ identifies a virtual active set of bridges and\n   LANs.  The address is assumed\
    \ to be unique and invariant within the\n   VLAN.  MAC addresses are often globally\
    \ unique, but this is not\n   necessary for bridging.\n"
- title: 3.  Framework
  contents:
  - "3.  Framework\n   As defined in the GMPLS architecture [RFC3945], the GMPLS control\n\
    \   plane can be applied to a technology by controlling the data-plane\n   and\
    \ switching characteristics of that technology.  The GMPLS\n   architecture, per\
    \ [RFC3945], allowed for control of Ethernet bridges\n   and other Layer 2 technologies\
    \ using the Layer-2 Switch Capable\n   (L2SC) switching type.  But, the control\
    \ of Ethernet switching was\n   not explicitly defined in [RFC3471], [RFC4202],\
    \ or any other\n   subsequent GMPLS reference document.\n   The GMPLS architecture\
    \ includes a clear separation between a control\n   plane and a data plane.  Control\
    \ plane and data plane separation\n   allows the GMPLS control plane to remain\
    \ architecturally and\n   functionally unchanged while controlling different technologies.\
    \  The\n   architecture also requires IP connectivity for the control plane to\n\
    \   exchange information, but does not otherwise require an IP data\n   plane.\n\
    \   All aspects of GMPLS, i.e., addressing, signaling, routing and link\n   management,\
    \ may be applied to Ethernet switching.  GMPLS can provide\n   control for traffic-engineered\
    \ and protected Ethernet service paths.\n   This document defines the term \"\
    Eth-LSP\" to refer to Ethernet service\n   paths that are controlled via GMPLS.\
    \  As is the case with all GMPLS\n   controlled services, Eth-LSPs can leverage\
    \ common traffic engineering\n   attributes such as:\n   - bandwidth profile;\n\
    \   - forwarding priority level;\n   - connection preemption characteristics;\n\
    \   - protection/resiliency capability;\n   - routing policy, such as an explicit\
    \ route;\n   - bidirectional service;\n   - end-to-end and segment protection;\n\
    \   - hierarchy\n   The bandwidth profile may be used to set the committed information\n\
    \   rate, peak information rate, and policies based on either under-\n   subscription\
    \ or over-subscription.  Services covered by this\n   framework will use a TSpec\
    \ that follows the Ethernet Traffic\n   parameters defined in [ETH-TSPEC].\n \
    \  In applying GMPLS to \"transport\" Ethernet, GMPLS will need to be\n   extended\
    \ to work with the Ethernet data plane and switching\n   functions.  The definition\
    \ of GMPLS support for Ethernet is\n   multifaceted due to the different forwarding/switching\
    \ functions\n   inherent in the different service types discussed in Section 2.1.\
    \  In\n   general, the header fields used in the forwarding/switching function,\n\
    \   e.g., VID and DMAC, can be characterized as a data-plane label.  In\n   some\
    \ circumstances, these fields will be constant along the path of\n   the Eth-LSP,\
    \ and in others they may vary hop-by-hop or at certain\n   interfaces only along\
    \ the path.  In the case where the \"labels\" must\n   be forwarded unchanged,\
    \ there are a few constraints on the label\n   allocation that are similar to\
    \ some other technologies such as lambda\n   labels.\n   The characteristics of\
    \ the \"transport\" Ethernet data plane are not\n   modified in order to apply\
    \ GMPLS control.  For example, consider the\n   IEEE 802.1Q [802.1Q] data plane:\
    \ The VID is used as a \"filter\"\n   pointing to a particular forwarding table,\
    \ and if the DMAC is found\n   in that forwarding table, the forwarding decision\
    \ is made based on\n   the DMAC.  When forwarding using a spanning tree, if the\
    \ DMAC is not\n   found, the frame is broadcast over all outgoing interfaces for\
    \ which\n   that VID is defined.  This valid MAC checking and broadcast supports\n\
    \   Ethernet learning.  A special case is when a VID is defined for only\n   two\
    \ ports on one bridge, effectively resulting in a P2P forwarding\n   constraint.\
    \  In this case, all frames that are tagged with that VID\n   and received over\
    \ one of these ports are forwarded over the other\n   port without address learning.\n\
    \   [802.1Qay] allows for turning off learning and hence the broadcast\n   mechanism\
    \ that provides means to create explicitly routed Ethernet\n   connections.\n\
    \   This document does not define any specific format for an Eth-LSP\n   label.\
    \  Rather, it is expected that service-specific documents will\n   define any\
    \ signaling and routing extensions needed to support a\n   specific Ethernet service.\
    \  Depending on the requirements of a\n   service, it may be necessary to define\
    \ multiple GMPLS protocol\n   extensions and procedures.  It is expected that\
    \ all such extensions\n   will be consistent with this document.\n   It is expected\
    \ that a key requirement for service-specific documents\n   will be to describe\
    \ label formats and encodings.  It may also be\n   necessary to provide a mechanism\
    \ to identify the required Ethernet\n   service type in signaling and a way to\
    \ advertise the capabilities of\n   Ethernet switches in the routing protocols.\
    \  These mechanisms must\n   make it possible to distinguish between requests\
    \ for different\n   paradigms including new, future, and existing paradigms.\n\
    \   The Switching Type and Interface Switching Capability Descriptor\n   share\
    \ a common set of values and are defined in [RFC3945], [RFC3471],\n   and [RFC4202]\
    \ as indicators of the type of switching that should\n   ([RFC3471]) and can ([RFC4202])\
    \ be performed on a particular link for\n   an LSP.  The L2SC switching type may\
    \ already be used by\n   implementations performing Layer 2 Switching including\
    \ Ethernet.  As\n   such, and to allow the continued use of that switching type\
    \ and those\n   implementations, and to distinguish the different Ethernet switching\n\
    \   paradigms, a new switching type needs to be defined for each new\n   Ethernet\
    \ switching paradigm that is supported.\n   For discussion purposes, we decompose\
    \ the problem of applying GMPLS\n   into the functions of routing, signaling,\
    \ link management, and path\n   selection.  It is possible to use some functions\
    \ of GMPLS alone or in\n   partial combinations.  In most cases, using all functions\
    \ of GMPLS\n   leads to less operational overhead than partial combinations.\n"
- title: 4.  GMPLS Routing and Addressing Model
  contents:
  - "4.  GMPLS Routing and Addressing Model\n   The GMPLS routing and addressing model\
    \ is not modified by this\n   document.  GMPLS control for Eth-LSPs uses the routing\
    \ and addressing\n   model described in [RFC3945].  Most notably, this includes\
    \ the use of\n   IP addresses to identify interfaces and LSP end-points.  It also\n\
    \   includes support for both numbered and unnumbered interfaces.\n   In the case\
    \ where another address family or type of identifier is\n   required to support\
    \ an Ethernet service, extensions may be defined to\n   provide mapping to an\
    \ IP address.  Support of Eth-LSPs is expected to\n   strictly comply to the GMPLS\
    \ protocol suite addressing as specified\n   in [RFC3471], [RFC3473], and related\
    \ documents.\n"
- title: 4.1.  GMPLS Routing
  contents:
  - "4.1.  GMPLS Routing\n   GMPLS routing as defined in [RFC4202] uses IP routing\
    \ protocols with\n   opaque TLV extensions for the purpose of distributing GMPLS-related\n\
    \   TE (router and link) information.  As is always the case with GMPLS,\n   TE\
    \ information is populated based on resource information obtained\n   from LMP\
    \ or from configured information.  The bandwidth resources of\n   the links are\
    \ tracked as Eth-LSPs are set up.  Interfaces supporting\n   the switching of\
    \ Eth-LSPs are identified using the appropriate\n   Interface Switching Capabilities\
    \ (ISC) Descriptor.  As mentioned in\n   Section 3, the definition of one or more\
    \ new ISCs to support Eth-LSPs\n   is expected.  Again, the L2SC ISCs will not\
    \ be used to represent\n   interfaces capable of supporting Eth-LSPs defined by\
    \ this document\n   and subsequent documents in support of the transport Ethernet\n\
    \   switching paradigms.  In addition, ISC-specific TE information may be\n  \
    \ defined as needed to support the requirements of a specific Ethernet\n   Switching\
    \ Service Type.\n   GMPLS routing is an optional functionality but it is highly\
    \ valuable\n   in maintaining topology and distributing the TE database for path\n\
    \   management and dynamic path computation.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Control Plane Network
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Control Plane Network\n   In order for a GMPLS control plane to operate,\
    \ an IP connectivity\n   network of sufficient capacity to handle the information\
    \ exchange of\n   the GMPLS routing and signaling protocols is necessary.\n  \
    \ One way to implement this is with an IP-routed network supported by\n   an IGP\
    \ that views each switch as a terminated IP adjacency.  In other\n   words, IP\
    \ traffic and a simple routing table are available for the\n   control plane,\
    \ but there is no requirement for a high-performance IP\n   data plane, or for\
    \ forwarding user traffic over this IP network.\n   This IP connectivity can be\
    \ provided as a separate independent\n   network (out-of-band) or integrated with\
    \ the Ethernet switches (in-\n   band).\n"
- title: 5.  GMPLS Signaling
  contents:
  - "5.  GMPLS Signaling\n   GMPLS signaling ([RFC3471] and [RFC3473]) is well suited\
    \ to the\n   control of Eth-LSPs and Ethernet switches.  Signaling provides the\n\
    \   ability to dynamically establish a path from an ingress node to an\n   egress\
    \ node.  The signaled path may be completely static and not\n   change for the\
    \ duration of its lifetime.  However, signaling also has\n   the capability to\
    \ dynamically adjust the path in a coordinated\n   fashion after the path has\
    \ been established.  The range of signaling\n   options from static to dynamic\
    \ are under operator control.\n   Standardized signaling also improves multi-vendor\
    \ interoperability.\n   GMPLS signaling supports the establishment and control\
    \ of\n   bidirectional and unidirectional data paths.  Ethernet is\n   bidirectional\
    \ by nature and CFM has been built to leverage this.\n   Prior to CFM, the emulation\
    \ of a physical wire and the learning\n   requirements also mandated bidirectional\
    \ connections.  Given this,\n   Eth-LSPs need to be bidirectional congruent. \
    \ Eth-LSPs may be either\n   P2P or P2MP (see [RFC4875]).  GMPLS signaling also\
    \ allows for full\n   and partial LSP protection; see [RFC4872] and [RFC4873].\n\
    \   Note that standard GMPLS does not support different bandwidth in each\n  \
    \ direction of a bidirectional LSP.  [RFC5467], an Experimental\n   document,\
    \ provides procedures if asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional\n   LSPs are required.\n"
- title: 6.  Link Management
  contents:
  - "6.  Link Management\n   Link discovery has been specified for links interconnecting\
    \ IEEE\n   802.1 bridges in [802.1AB].  The benefits of running link discovery\n\
    \   in large systems are significant.  Link discovery may reduce\n   configuration\
    \ and reduce the possibility of undetected errors in\n   configuration as well\
    \ as exposing misconnections.  However, the\n   802.1AB capability is an optional\
    \ feature, so it is not necessarily\n   operating before a link is operational,\
    \ and it primarily supports the\n   management plane.\n   In the GMPLS context,\
    \ LMP [RFC4204] has been defined to support GMPLS\n   control-plane link management\
    \ and discovery features.  LMP also\n   supports the automated creation of unnumbered\
    \ interfaces for the\n   control plane.  If LMP is not used, there is an additional\n\
    \   configuration requirement for GMPLS link identifiers.  For large-\n   scale\
    \ implementations, LMP is beneficial.  LMP also has optional\n   fault management\
    \ capabilities, primarily for opaque and transparent\n   network technology. \
    \ With IEEE's newer CFM [802.1ag] and ITU-T's\n   capabilities [Y.1731], this\
    \ optional capability may not be needed.\n   It is the goal of the GMPLS Ethernet\
    \ architecture to allow the\n   selection of the best tool set for the user needs.\
    \  The full\n   functionality of Ethernet CFM should be supported when using a\
    \ GMPLS\n   control plane.\n   LMP and 802.1AB are relatively independent.  The\
    \ LMP capability\n   should be sufficient to remove the need for 802.1AB, but\
    \ 802.1 AB can\n   be run in parallel or independently if desired.  Figure 2 provides\n\
    \   possible ways of using LMP, 802.1AB, and 802.1ag in combination.\n   Figure\
    \ 2 illustrates the functional relationship of link management\n   and OAM schemes.\
    \  It is expected that LMP would be used for control-\n   plane functions of link\
    \ property correlation, but that Ethernet\n   mechanisms for OAM such as CFM,\
