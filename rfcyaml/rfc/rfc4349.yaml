- contents:
  - "2.  Control Connection Establishment\n   In order to tunnel an HDLC link over
    IP using L2TPv3, an L2TPv3\n   Control Connection MUST first be established as
    described in\n   [RFC3931].  The L2TPv3 SCCRQ Control Message and corresponding
    SCCRP\n   Control Message MUST include the HDLC Pseudowire Type of 0x0006 (see\n
    \  Section 7, \"IANA Considerations\"), in the Pseudowire Capabilities\n   List
    as defined in 5.4.3 of [RFC3931].  This identifies the control\n   connection
    as able to establish L2TP sessions to support HDLC\n   Pseudowires (HDLCPWs).\n
    \  An LCCE MUST be able to uniquely identify itself in the SCCRQ and\n   SCCRP
    messages via a globally unique value.  By default, this is\n   advertised via
    the structured Router ID AVP [RFC3931], though the\n   unstructured Hostname AVP
    [RFC3931] MAY be used to identify LCCEs as\n   well.\n"

  - "3.  HDLC Link Status Notification and Session Establishment\n   This section
    specifies how the status of an HDLC interface is\n   reported between two LCCEs,

  - contents:
    - "3.1.  L2TPv3 Session Establishment\n   Associating an HDLC serial interface
      with a PW and its transition to\n   \"Ready\" or \"Up\" results in the establishment
      of an L2TP session via\n   the standard three-way handshake described in Section
      3.4.1 of\n   [RFC3931].  For purposes of this discussion, the action of locally\n
      \  associating an interface running HDLC with a PW by local\n   configuration
      or otherwise is referred to as \"provisioning\" the HDLC\n   interface.  The
      transition of the interface to \"ready\" or \"up\" will\n   be referred to as
      the interface becoming ACTIVE.  The transition of\n   the interface to \"not-ready\"
      or \"down\" will be referred to as the\n   interface becoming INACTIVE.\n   An
      LCCE MAY initiate the session immediately upon association with an\n   HDLC
      interface or wait until the interface becomes ACTIVE before\n   attempting to
      establish an L2TP session.  Waiting until the interface\n   transitions to ACTIVE
      may be preferred, as it delays allocation of\n   resources until absolutely
      necessary.\n   The Pseudowire Type AVP defined in Section 5.4.4 of [RFC3931],\n
      \  Attribute Type 68, MUST be present in the ICRQ messages and MUST\n   include
      the Pseudowire Type of 0x0006 for HDLCPWs.\n   The Circuit Status AVP (see Section
      3.4) MUST be present in the ICRQ\n   and ICRP messages and MAY be present in
      the SLI message for HDLCPWs.\n   Following is an example of the L2TP messages
      exchanged for an HDLCPW\n   that is initiated after an HDLC interface is provisioned
      and becomes\n   ACTIVE.\n         LCCE (LAC) A                     LCCE (LAC)

      session established,\n                                    OK to send data into
      tunnel\n   In the example above, an ICRQ is sent after the interface is\n   provisioned
      and becomes ACTIVE.  The Circuit Status AVP indicates\n   that this link is
      ACTIVE and New (0x03).  The Remote End ID AVP\n   [RFC3931] MUST be present
      in the ICRQ in order to identify the HDLC\n   link (together with the identity
      of the LCCE itself as defined in\n   Section 2) with which to associate the
      L2TP session.  The Remote End\n   ID AVP defined in [RFC3931] is of opaque form
      and variable length,\n   though one MUST at a minimum support use of an unstructured
      four-\n   octet value that is known to both LCCEs (either by direct\n   configuration,
      or some other means).  The exact method of how this\n   value is configured,
      retrieved, discovered, or otherwise determined\n   at each LCCE is outside the
      scope of this document.\n   As with the ICRQ, the ICRP is sent only after the
      associated HDLC\n   interface transitions to ACTIVE as well.  If LCCE B had
      not been\n   provisioned for the interface identified in the ICRQ, a CDN would\n
      \  have been immediately returned indicating that the associated link\n   was
      not provisioned or available at this LCCE.  LCCE A SHOULD then\n   exhibit a
      periodic retry mechanism.  If so, the period and maximum\n   number of retries
      MUST be configurable.\n   An Implementation MAY send an ICRQ or ICRP before
      an HDLC interface\n   is ACTIVE, as long as the Circuit Status AVP reflects
      that the link\n   is INACTIVE and an SLI is sent when the HDLC interface becomes
      ACTIVE\n   (see Section 3.3).\n   The ICCN is the final stage in the session
      establishment, confirming\n   the receipt of the ICRP with acceptable parameters
      to allow\n   bidirectional traffic.\n"

      at either LCCE, the\n   associated L2TP session MUST be torn down via the CDN
      message defined\n   in Section 3.4.3 of [RFC3931].\n   General Result Codes
      regarding L2TP session establishment are defined\n   in [RFC3931].  Additional
      HDLC result codes are defined as follows:\n      20 - HDLC Link was deleted
      permanently (no longer provisioned)\n      21 - HDLC Link has been INACTIVE

    - "3.3.  L2TPv3 Session Maintenance\n   HDLCPWs over L2TP make use of the Set
      Link Info (SLI) control message\n   defined in [RFC3931] to signal HDLC link
      status notifications between\n   PEs.  The SLI message is a single message that
      is sent over the L2TP\n   control channel, signaling the interface state change.\n
      \  The SLI message MUST be sent any time there is a status change of any\n   values
      identified in the Circuit Status AVP.  The only exceptions to\n   this are the
      initial ICRQ, ICRP, and CDN messages, which establish\n   and teardown the L2TP
      session itself.  The SLI message may be sent\n   from either PE at any time
      after the first ICRQ is sent (and perhaps\n   before an ICRP is received, requiring
      the peer to perform a reverse\n   Session ID lookup).\n   All sessions established
      by a given control connection utilize the\n   L2TP Hello facility defined in
      Section 4.4 of [RFC3931] for session\n   keepalive.  This gives all sessions
      basic dead peer and path\n   detection between PEs.\n"

    - "4.1.  Data Packet Encapsulation\n   HDLCPWs use the default encapsulations
      defined in [RFC3931] for\n   demultiplexing, sequencing, and flags.  The HDLCPW
      Type over L2TP is\n   intended to operate in an \"interface to interface\" or
      \"port to port\"\n   fashion, passing all HDLC data and control PDUs over the
      PW.  The\n   HDLC PDU is stripped of flags and trailing FCS, bit/byte unstuffing\n
      \  is performed, and the remaining data, including the address, control,\n   and
      protocol fields, is transported over the PW.\n   Since all packets are passed
      in a largely transparent manner over the\n   HDLCPW, any protocol that has HDLC-like
      framing may utilize the\n   HDLCPW mode, including PPP, Frame-Relay (\"port
      to port\" Frame-Relay\n   transport), X.25 (LAPB), etc.  In such cases, the
      negotiations and\n   signaling of the specific protocols transported over the
      HDLCPW take\n   place between the Remote Systems.  A non-exhaustive list of
      examples\n   and considerations of this transparent nature include:\n      o
      When the HDLCPW transports Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)\n        traffic, PPP
      negotiations (Link Control Protocol, optional\n        authentication, and Network
      Control Protocols) are performed\n        between Remote Systems, and LCCEs
      do not participate in these\n        negotiations.\n      o When the HDLCPW
      transports Frame-Relay traffic, PVC status\n        management procedures (Local
      Management Interface) take place\n        between Remote Systems, and LCCEs
      do not participate in LMI.\n        Additionally, individual Frame-Relay virtual-circuits
      are not\n        visible to the LCCEs, and the FECN, BECN, and DE bits are\n
      \       transported transparently.\n      o When the HDLCPW transports X.25
      (LAPB) traffic, LCCEs do not\n        function as either LAPB DCE or DTE devices.\n
      \  On the other hand, exceptions include cases where direct access to\n   the
      HDLC interface is required, or modes that operate on the flags,\n   FCS, or
      bit/byte unstuffing that is performed before sending the HDLC\n   PDU over the

  - "5.  Applicability Statement\n   HDLC Pseudowires support a \"port to port\" or
    \"interface to interface\"\n   deployment model operating in a point-to-point
    fashion.  In addition\n   to the transport of HDLC frames, a natural application
    of HDLCPWs\n   allows for the transport of any protocol using an HDLC-like framing.\n
    \  The HDLCPW emulation over a packet-switched network (PSN) has the\n   following
    characteristics in relationship to the native service:\n      o HDLC data and
    control fields are transported transparently (see\n        Section 4.1).  The
    specific negotiations and signaling of the\n        protocol being transported
    are performed between Remote Systems\n        transparently, and the LCCE does
    not participate in them.\n      o The trailing FCS (Frame Check Sequence) containing
    a CRC (Cyclic\n        Redundancy Check) is stripped at the ingress LCCE and not\n
    \       transported over HDLCPWs.  It is therefore regenerated at the\n        egress
    LCCE (see Section 4.1).  This means that the FCS may not\n        accurately reflect
    errors on the end-to-end HDLC link.  Errors\n        or corruption introduced
    in the HDLCPW payload during\n        encapsulation or transit across the packet-switched
    network may\n        not be detected.  This lack of integrity-check transparency
    may\n        not be of concern if it is known that the inner payloads or\n        upper
    protocols transported perform their own error and\n        integrity checking.
    \ To allow for payload integrity-checking\n        transparency on HDLCPWs using
    L2TP over IP or L2TP over UDP/IP,\n        the L2TPv3 session can utilize IPSec
    as specified in Section\n        4.1.3 of [RFC3931].\n      o HDLC link status
    notification is provided using the Circuit\n        Status AVP in the SLI message
    (see Section 3.4).\n      o The length of the resulting L2TPv3 packet is longer
    than the\n        encapsulated HDLC frame without flags and FCS (see Section 4.3),\n
    \       with resulting MTU and fragmentation implications discussed in\n        Section
    4.1.4 of [RFC3931].\n      o The packet-switched network may reorder, duplicate,
    or silently\n        drop packets.  Sequencing may be enabled in the HDLCPW for
    some\n        or all packets to detect lost, duplicate, or out-of-order\n        packets
    on a per-session basis (see Section 4.2).\n      o The faithfulness of an HDLCPW
