  - "1.  Introduction\n   Users of both voice-centric (telephone-like) and non-voice\
    \ services,\n   such as text communication for hearing-disabled users (see [RFC3351]\n\
    \   and [toip]), expect to be able to initiate a request for help in case\n  \
    \ of an emergency.\n   Unfortunately, the existing mechanisms to support emergency\
    \ calls\n   that have evolved within the public circuit-switched telephone\n \
    \  network (PSTN) are not appropriate to handle evolving IP-based voice,\n   text,\
    \ and real-time multimedia communications.  This document\n   outlines the key\
    \ requirements that IP-based end systems and network\n   elements, such as Session\
    \ Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261]\n   proxies, need to satisfy in order to\
    \ provide emergency call services,\n   which at a minimum, offer the same functionality\
    \ as existing PSTN\n   services, with the additional overall goal of making emergency\n\
    \   calling more robust, less costly to implement, and multimedia-\n   capable.\n\
    \   This document only focuses on end-to-end IP-based calls, i.e., where\n   the\
    \ emergency call originates from an IP end system and terminates in\n   an IP-capable\
    \ public safety answering point (PSAP), conveyed entirely\n   over an IP network.\n\
    \   We first define terminology in Section 3.  The document then outlines\n  \
    \ various functional issues that relate to placing an IP-based\n   emergency call,\
    \ including a description of baseline requirements\n   (Section 5), identification\
    \ of the emergency caller's location\n   (Section 6), use of a service identifier\
    \ to declare a call to be an\n   emergency call (Section 7), and finally, the\
    \ mapping function\n   required to route the call to the appropriate PSAP (Section\
    \ 8).\n   The primary purpose of the mapping protocol is to produce a PSAP URI\n\
    \   drawn from a preferred set of URI schemes such as SIP or SIPS URIs,\n   based\
    \ on both location information [RFC4119] and a service identifier\n   in order\
    \ to facilitate the IP end-to-end completion of an emergency\n   call.\n   Aside\
    \ from obtaining a PSAP URI, the mapping protocol is useful for\n   obtaining\
    \ other information as well.  There may be a case, for\n   example, where an appropriate\
    \ emergency number is not known, only the\n   location.  The mapping protocol\
    \ can then return a geographically\n   appropriate emergency number based on the\
    \ input.\n   Since some PSAPs may not immediately support IP, or because some\
    \ user\n   equipment (UE) may not initially support emergency service\n   identifiers,\
    \ it may be necessary to also support emergency service\n   identifiers that utilize\
    \ less-preferred URI schemes, such as a tel\n   URI in order to complete an emergency\
    \ call via the PSTN.\n   Identification of the caller, while not incompatible\
    \ with the\n   requirements for messaging outlined within this document, is\n\
    \   considered to be outside the scope of this document.\n   Location is required\
    \ for two separate purposes: first, to support the\n   routing of the emergency\
    \ call to the appropriate PSAP and second, to\n   display the caller's location\
    \ to the call taker to help in\n   dispatching emergency assistance to the appropriate\
    \ location.\n   This latter use, the display of location information to the PSAP,\
    \ is\n   orthogonal to the mapping protocol, and is outside the scope of this\n\
    \   document.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Emergency Services\n   Basic emergency service:  Basic emergency service\
    \ allows a caller to\n      reach a PSAP serving its current location, but the\
    \ PSAP may not be\n      able to determine the identity or geographic location\
    \ of the\n      caller, except by the call taker asking the caller.\n   Enhanced\
    \ emergency service:  In enhanced emergency service, the PSAP\n      call taker\
    \ can determine the caller's current location.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Service Providers
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Service Providers\n   Internet Access Provider (IAP):  An organization\
    \ that provides\n      physical and data link (layer 2) network connectivity to\
    \ its\n      customers or users, e.g., through digital subscriber lines, cable\n\
    \      TV plants, Ethernet, leased lines, or radio frequencies.  Examples\n  \
    \    of such organizations include telecommunication carriers,\n      municipal\
    \ utilities, larger enterprises with their own network\n      infrastructure,\
    \ and government organizations, such as the\n      military.\n   Internet Service\
    \ Provider (ISP):  An organization that provides IP\n      network-layer services\
    \ to its customers or users.  This entity may\n      or may not provide the physical-layer\
    \ and data link (layer-2)\n      connectivity, such as fiber or Ethernet, i.e.,\
    \ it may or may not\n      play the role of an IAP.\n   Application Service Provider\
    \ (ASP):  The organization or entity that\n      provides application-layer services,\
    \ which may include voice (see\n      \"Voice Service Provider\").  This entity\
    \ can be a private\n      individual, an enterprise, a government, or a service\
    \ provider.\n      An ASP is more general than a Voice Service Provider, since\n\
    \      emergency calls may use other media beyond voice, including text\n    \
    \  and video.  For a particular user, the ASP may or may not be the\n      same\
    \ organization as his IAP or ISP.\n   Voice Service Provider (VSP):  A specific\
    \ type of Application Service\n      Provider that provides voice related services\
    \ based on IP, such as\n      call routing, a SIP URI, or PSTN termination.  In\
    \ this document,\n      unless noted otherwise, any reference to \"Voice Service\
    \ Provider\"\n      or \"VSP\" may be used interchangeably with \"Application/Voice\n\
    \      Service Provider\" or \"ASP/VSP\".\n"
- title: 3.3.  Actors
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Actors\n   (Emergency) caller:  The term \"caller\" or \"emergency caller\"\
    \ refers\n      to the person placing an emergency call or sending an emergency\n\
    \      instant message (IM).\n   User Equipment (UE):  User equipment is the device\
    \ or software\n      operated by the caller to place an emergency call.  A SIP\
    \ user\n      agent (UA) is an example of user equipment.\n   Call taker:  A call\
    \ taker is an agent at the PSAP that accepts calls\n      and may dispatch emergency\
    \ help.  Sometimes the functions of call\n      taking and dispatching are handled\
    \ by different groups of people,\n      but these divisions of labor are not generally\
    \ visible to the\n      caller and thus do not concern us here.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Call Routing Entities
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Call Routing Entities\n   Emergency Service Routing Proxy (ESRP):  An ESRP\
    \ is an emergency call\n      routing support entity that invokes the location-to-PSAP\
    \ URI\n      mapping function, to return an appropriate PSAP URI, or the URI\n\
    \      for another ESRP.  Client mapping requests could also be performed\n  \
    \    by a number of entities, including entities that instantiate the\n      SIP\
    \ proxy role and the SIP user agent client role.\n   Public Safety Answering Point\
    \ (PSAP):  A PSAP is a facility where\n      emergency calls are received under\
    \ the responsibility of a public\n      authority.  (This terminology is used\
    \ by both the European\n      Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), in\
    \ ETSI SR 002 180,\n      and the National Emergency Number Association (NENA).)\
    \  In the\n      United Kingdom, PSAPs are called Operator Assistance Centres;\
    \ in\n      New Zealand, Communications Centres.  Within this document, it is\n\
    \      assumed, unless stated otherwise, that PSAPs support the receipt\n    \
    \  of emergency calls over IP, using appropriate application layer\n      protocols,\
    \ such as SIP for call signaling and RTP for media.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Location
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Location\n   Location:  A geographic identification assigned to a region\
    \ or\n      feature based on a specific coordinate system, or by other precise\n\
    \      information such as a street number and name.  It can be either a\n   \
    \   civic or geographic location.\n   Civic location:  A described location based\
    \ on some reference system,\n      such as jurisdictional region or postal delivery\
    \ grid.  A street\n      address is a common example of a civic location.\n  \
    \ Geographic location:  A reference to a point that is able to be\n      located,\
    \ as described by a set of defined coordinates within a\n      geographic coordinate\
    \ system, such as latitude and longitude\n      within the WGS-84 datum.  For\
    \ example, a 2-D geographic location\n      is defined as an (x,y) coordinate\
    \ value pair according to the\n      distance north or south of the equator and\
    \ east or west of the\n      prime meridian.\n   Location validation:  A caller\
    \ location is considered valid if the\n      civic or geographic location is recognizable\
    \ within an acceptable\n      location reference system (e.g., United States Postal\
    \ Address or\n      the WGS-84 datum) and can be mapped to one or more PSAPs.\
    \  While\n      it is desirable to determine that a location exists, validation\n\
    \      may not ensure that such a location exists, but rather may only\n     \
    \ ensure that the location falls within some range of known values.\n      Location\
    \ validation ensures that a location is able to be\n      referenced for mapping,\
    \ but makes no assumption about the\n      association between the caller and\
    \ the caller's location.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Identifiers, Numbers, and Dial Strings
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Identifiers, Numbers, and Dial Strings\n   (Emergency) service number:\
    \  The (emergency) service number is a\n      string of digits used to reach the\
    \ (emergency) service.  The\n      emergency service number is often just called\
    \ the emergency\n      number.  It is the number typically dialed on devices directly\n\
    \      connected to the PSTN and the number reserved for emergency calls\n   \
    \   by national or regional numbering authorities.  It only contains\n      the\
    \ digits 0 through 9, #, and *.  The service number may depend\n      on the location\
    \ of the caller.  For example, the general emergency\n      service number in\
    \ the United States is 911 and the poison control\n      service number is 18002221222.\
    \  In most cases, the service number\n      and dial string are the same; they\
    \ may differ in some private\n      phone networks.  A service number may be carried\
    \ in tel URLs\n      [RFC3966], along with a context identifier.  In the North\
    \ American\n      numbering plan, some service numbers are three-digit N11 or\n\
    \      service codes, but not all emergency numbers have three digits.  A\n  \
    \    caller may have to dial a service dial string (below) that differs\n    \
    \  from the service number when using a PBX.\n   (Emergency) service dial string:\
    \  The service dial string identifies\n      the string of digits that a caller\
    \ must dial to reach a particular\n      (emergency) service.  In devices directly\
    \ connected to the PSTN,\n      the service dial string is the same as the service\
    \ number and may\n      thus depend on the location of the caller.  However, in\
    \ private\n      phone networks, such as in PBXs, the service dial string consists\n\
    \      of a dialing prefix to reach an outside line, followed by the\n      emergency\
    \ number.  For example, in a hotel, the dial string for\n      emergency services\
    \ in the United States might be 9911.  Dial\n      strings may contain indications\
    \ of pauses or wait-for-secondary-\n      dial-tone indications.  Service dial\
    \ strings are outside the scope\n      of this document.\n   (Emergency) service\
    \ identifier:  The (emergency) service identifier\n      describes the emergency\
    \ service, independent of the user interface\n      mechanism, the signaling protocol\
    \ that is used to reach the\n      service, or the caller's geographic location.\
    \  It is a protocol\n      constant and used within the mapping and signaling\
    \ protocols.  An\n      example is the service URN [RFC5031].\n   (Emergency)\
    \ service URL:  The service URL is a protocol-specific\n      (e.g., SIP) or protocol-agnostic\
    \ (e.g., im: [RFC3860]) identifier\n      that contains the address of the PSAP\
    \ or other emergency service.\n      It depends on the specific signaling or data\
    \ transport protocol\n      used to reach the emergency service.\n   Service URN:\
    \  A service URN is an implementation of a service\n      identifier, which can\
    \ be applied to both emergency and non-\n      emergency contexts, e.g., urn:service:sos\
    \ or\n      urn:service:counseling.  Within this document, service URNs are\n\
    \      referred to as 'emergency service URNs' [RFC5031].\n   Home emergency number:\
    \  A home emergency number is the emergency\n      number valid at the caller's\
    \ customary home location, e.g., his\n      permanent residence.  The home location\
    \ may or may not coincide\n      with the service area of the caller's VSP.\n\
    \   Home emergency dial string:  A home dial string is the dial string\n     \
    \ valid at the caller's customary home location, e.g., his permanent\n      residence.\n\
    \   Visited emergency number:  A visited emergency number is the\n      emergency\
    \ number valid at the caller's current physical location.\n      We distinguish\
    \ the visited emergency number if the caller is\n      traveling outside his home\
    \ region.\n   Visited emergency dial string:  A visited emergency dial string\
    \ is\n      the dial string number valid at the caller's current physical\n  \
    \    location.\n"

    \ act as their own ASP/VSP, e.g., either for enterprises or for\n   residential\
    \ users.\n   Various potential interactions between the entities depicted in\n\
    \   Figure 1 are described below:\n   1.  Location information might be available\
    \ to the end host itself.\n   2.  Location information might, however, also be\
    \ obtained from the\n       Internet Access Provider.\n   3.  The emergency caller\
    \ might need to consult a mapping service to\n       determine the PSAP (or other\
    \ relevant information) that is\n       appropriate for the physical location\
    \ of the emergency caller,\n       possibly considering other attributes, such\
    \ as appropriate\n       language support by the emergency call taker.\n   4.\
    \  The emergency caller might get assistance for emergency call\n       routing\
    \ by infrastructure elements that are emergency call\n       routing support entities,\
    \ such as an Emergency Service Routing\n       Proxy (ESRP) in SIP.\n   5.  Location\
    \ information is used by emergency call routing support\n       entities for subsequent\
    \ mapping requests.\n   6.  Emergency call routing support entities might need\
    \ to consult a\n       mapping service to determine where to route the emergency\
    \ call.\n   7.  For infrastructure-based emergency call routing (in contrast to\n\
    \       UE-based emergency call routing), the emergency call routing\n       support\
    \ entity needs to forward the call to the PSAP.\n   8.  The emergency caller may\
    \ interact directly with the PSAP, where\n       the UE invokes mapping, and initiates\
    \ a connection, without\n       relying on any intermediary emergency call routing\
    \ support\n       entities.\n"
- title: 5.  High-Level Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  High-Level Requirements\n   Below, we summarize high-level architectural\
    \ requirements that guide\n   some of the component requirements detailed later\
    \ in the document.\n   Re1.  Application/Voice service provider existence:  The\
    \ initiation\n      of an IP-based emergency call SHOULD NOT assume the existence\
    \ of\n      an Application/Voice Service Provider (ASP/VSP).\n      Motivation:\
    \ The caller may not have an application/voice service\n      provider.  For example,\
    \ a residence may have its own DNS domain\n      and run its own SIP proxy server\
    \ for that domain.  On a larger\n      scale, a university might provide voice\
    \ services to its students\n      and staff, but might not be a telecommunication\
    \ provider.\n   Re2.  International applicability:  Regional, political, and\n\
    \      organizational aspects MUST be considered during the design of\n      protocols\
    \ and protocol extensions that support IP-based emergency\n      calls.\n    \
    \  Motivation: It must be possible for a device or software developed\n      or\
    \ purchased in one country to place emergency calls in another\n      country.\
    \  System components should not be biased towards a\n      particular set of emergency\
    \ numbers or languages.  Also, different\n      countries have evolved different\
    \ ways of organizing emergency\n      services, e.g., either centralizing them\
    \ or having smaller\n      regional subdivisions, such as the United States or\n\
    \      municipalities, handle emergency calls within their jurisdiction.\n   Re3.\
    \  Distributed administration:  Deployment of IP-based emergency\n      services\
    \ MUST NOT depend on a single central administrative\n      authority.\n     \
    \ Motivation: The design of the mapping protocol must make it\n      possible\
    \ to deploy and administer emergency calling features on a\n      regional or\
    \ national basis without requiring coordination with\n      other regions or nations.\
    \  The system cannot assume, for example,\n      that there is a single global\
    \ entity issuing certificates for\n      PSAPs, ASP/VSPs, IAPs, or other participants.\n\
    \   Re4.  Multi-mode communication:  IP-based emergency calls MUST\n      support\
    \ multiple communication modes, including, for example,\n      audio, video, and\
    \ text.\n      Motivation: Within the PSTN, voice and text telephony (often\n\
    \      called TTY or text-phone in North America) are the only commonly\n    \
    \  supported media.  Emergency calling must support a variety of\n      media.\
    \  Such media should include voice, conversational text (RFC\n      4103 [RFC4103]),\
    \ instant messaging, and video.\n   Re5.  Mapping result usability:  The mapping\
    \ protocol MUST return one\n      or more URIs that are usable within a standard\
    \ signaling protocol\n      (i.e., without special emergency extensions).\n  \
    \    Motivation: For example, a SIP URI that is returned by the mapping\n    \
    \  protocol needs to be usable by any SIP-capable phone within a SIP-\n      initiated\
    \ emergency call.  This is in contrast to a \"special\n      purpose\" URI, which\
    \ may not be recognizable by a legacy SIP\n      device.\n   Re6.  PSAP URI accessibility:\
    \  The mapping protocol MUST support\n      interaction between the client and\
    \ server where no enrollment to a\n      mapping service exists or is required.\n\
    \      Motivation: The mapping server may well be operated by a service\n    \
    \  provider, but access to the server offering the mapping must not\n      require\
    \ use of a specific ISP or ASP/VSP.\n   Re7.  Common data structures and formats:\
    \  The mapping protocol\n      SHOULD support common formats (e.g., PIDF-LO) for\
    \ location data.\n      Motivation: Location databases should not need to be transformed\n\
    \      or modified in any unusual or unreasonable way in order for the\n     \
    \ mapping protocol to use the data.  For example, a database that\n      contains\
    \ civic addresses used by location servers may be used for\n      multiple purposes\
    \ and applications beyond emergency service\n      location-to-PSAP URI mapping.\n\
    \   Re8.  Anonymous mapping:  The mapping protocol MUST NOT require the\n    \
    \  true identity of the target for which the location information is\n      attributed.\n\
    \      Motivation: Ideally, no identity information is provided via the\n    \
    \  mapping protocol.  Where identity information is provided, it may\n      be\
    \ in the form of an unlinked pseudonym (RFC 3693 [RFC3693]).\n"
- title: 6.  Identifying the Caller's Location
  contents:
  - "6.  Identifying the Caller's Location\n   Location can either be provided directly\
    \ (by value), or via a pointer\n   (by reference), and represents either a civic\
    \ location, or a\n   geographic location.  An important question is how and when\
    \ to attach\n   location information to the VoIP emergency signaling messages.\
    \  In\n   general, we can distinguish three modes of operation of how a\n   location\
    \ is associated with an emergency call:\n   UA-inserted:  The caller's user agent\
    \ inserts the location\n      information into the call-signaling message.\n \
    \  UA-referenced:  The caller's user agent provides a pointer (i.e., a\n     \
    \ location reference), via a permanent or temporary identifier, to\n      the\
    \ location information, which is stored by a location server\n      somewhere\
    \ else and then retrieved by the PSAP, ESRP, or other\n      authorized entity.\n\
    \   Proxy-inserted:  A proxy along the call path inserts the location or\n   \
    \   location reference.\n   The following requirements apply:\n   Lo1.  Reference\
    \ datum:  The mapping protocol MUST support the WGS-84\n      coordinate reference\
    \ system and MAY support other coordinate\n      reference systems.\n      Motivation:\
    \ Though many different datums exist around the world,\n      this document recommends\
    \ the WGS-84 datum since it is designed to\n      describe the whole earth, rather\
    \ than a single continent or other\n      region, and is commonly used to represent\
    \ Global Positioning\n      System coordinates.\n   Lo2.  Location delivery by-value:\
    \  The mapping protocol MUST support\n      the delivery of location information\
    \ using a by-value method,\n      though it MAY also support de-referencing a\
    \ URL that references a\n      location object.\n      Motivation: The mapping\
    \ protocol is not required to support the\n      ability to de-reference specific\
    \ location references.\n   Lo3.  Alternate community names:  The mapping protocol\
    \ MUST support\n      both the jurisdictional community name and the postal community\n\
    \      name fields within the PIDF-LO [RFC4119] data.\n      Motivation: The mapping\
    \ protocol must accept queries with either a\n      postal or jurisdictional community\
    \ name field, or both, and\n      provide appropriate responses.  If a mapping\
    \ query contains only\n      one community name and the database contains both\
    \ jurisdictional\n      and postal community names, the mapping protocol response\
    \ SHOULD\n      return both community names.\n   Lo4.  Validation of civic location:\
    \  The mapping protocol MUST be\n      able to report the results of validating\
    \ civic locations (street\n      addresses).\n      Motivation: Location validation\
    \ provides an opportunity to help\n      ascertain ahead of time whether or not\
    \ a successful mapping to the\n      appropriate PSAP will likely occur when it\
    \ is required.\n      Validation may also help to avoid delays during emergency\
    \ call\n      setup due to invalid location data.\n   Lo5.  Information about\
    \ location data used for mapping:  The mapping\n      protocol MUST support the\
    \ ability to provide ancillary information\n      about the resolution of location\
    \ data used to retrieve a PSAP URI.\n      Motivation: The mapping server may\
    \ not use all the data elements\n      in the provided location information to\
    \ determine a match, or may\n      be able to find a match based on all of the\
    \ information except for\n      some specific data elements.  The uniqueness of\
    \ this information\n      set may be used to differentiate among emergency jurisdictions.\n\
    \      Precision or resolution in the context of this requirement might\n    \
    \  mean, for example, explicit identification of the data elements\n      that\
    \ were used successfully in the mapping.\n   Lo6.  Contact for location problems:\
    \  The mapping protocol MUST\n      support a mechanism to contact an appropriate\
    \ authority to resolve\n      mapping-related issues for the queried location.\
    \  For example, the\n      querier may want to report problems with the response\
    \ values or\n      indicate that the mapping database is mistaken on declaring\
    \ a\n      civic location as non-existent.\n      Motivation: Initially, authorities\
    \ may provide URLs where a human\n      user can report problems with an address\
    \ or location.  In\n      addition, web services may be defined to automate such\
    \ reporting.\n      For example, the querier may wish to report that the mapping\n\
    \      database may be missing a newly built or renamed street or house\n    \
    \  number.\n   Lo7.  Limits to validation:  Successful validation of a civic\n\
    \      location MUST NOT be required to place an emergency call.\n      Motivation:\
    \ In some cases, a civic location may not be considered\n      valid.  This fact\
    \ should not result in the call being dropped or\n      rejected by any entity\
    \ along the call setup signaling path to the\n      PSAP.\n   Lo8. 3D sensitive\
    \ mapping:  The mapping protocol MUST implement\n      support for both 2D and\
    \ 3D location information, and MAY accept\n      either a 2D or 3D mapping request\
    \ as input.\n      Motivation: It is expected that queriers may provide either\
    \ 2D or\n      3D data.  When a 3D request is presented within an area only\n\
    \      defined by 2D data within the mapping server, the mapping result\n    \
    \  would be the same as if the height or altitude coordinate had been\n      omitted\
    \ from the mapping request.\n   Lo9.  Database type indicator:  The mapping protocol\
    \ MAY support a\n      mechanism that provides an indication describing a specific\
    \ type\n      of location database used.\n      Motivation: It is useful to know\
    \ the source of the data stored in\n      the database used for location validation,\
    \ either for civic or\n      geographic location matching.  In the United States,\
    \ sources of\n      data could include the United States Postal Service, the Master\n\
    \      Street Address Guide (MSAG), or commercial map data providers.\n"
- title: 7.  Emergency Service Identifier
  contents:
  - "7.  Emergency Service Identifier\n   Emergency service identifiers are protocol\
    \ constants that allow\n   protocol entities, such as SIP proxy servers, to distinguish\n\
    \   emergency calls from non-emergency calls and to identify the specific\n  \
    \ emergency service desired.  Emergency service identifiers are a\n   subclass\
    \ of service identifiers that more generally identify services\n   reachable by\
    \ callers.  An example of a service identifier is the\n   service URN [RFC5031],\
    \ but other identifiers, such as tel URIs\n   [RFC3966], may also serve this role\
    \ during a transition period.\n   Since this document only addresses emergency\
    \ services, we use the\n   terms \"emergency service identifier\" and \"service\
    \ identifier\"\n   interchangeably.  Requirements for these identifiers include:\n\
    \   Id1.  Multiple emergency services:  The mapping protocol MUST be able\n  \
    \    to support different emergency services distinguished by different\n    \
    \  service identifiers.\n      Motivation: Some jurisdictions may offer multiple\
    \ types of\n      emergency services that operate independently and can be contacted\n\
    \      directly; for example, fire, police, and ambulance services.\n   Id2. \
    \ Extensible emergency service identifiers:  The mapping protocol\n      MUST\
    \ support an extensible list of emergency identifiers, though\n      it is not\
    \ required to provide mappings for every possible service.\n      Motivation:\
    \ Extensibility is required since new emergency services\n      may be introduced\
    \ over time, either globally or in some\n      jurisdictions.  The availability\
    \ of emergency services depends on\n      the locations.  For example, the Netherlands\
    \ are unlikely to offer\n      a mountain rescue service.\n   Id3.  Discovery\
    \ of emergency number:  The mapping protocol MUST be\n      able to return the\
    \ location-dependent emergency number for the\n      location indicated in the\
    \ query.\n      Motivation: Users are trained to dial the appropriate emergency\n\
    \      number to reach emergency services.  There needs to be a way to\n     \
    \ figure out the emergency number at the current location of the\n      caller.\n\
    \   Id4.  Home emergency number recognition:  User equipment MUST be able\n  \
    \    to translate a home emergency number into an emergency service\n      identifier.\n\
    \      Motivation: The UE could be pre-provisioned with the appropriate\n    \
    \  information in order to perform such a translation or could\n      discover\
    \ the emergency number by querying the mapping protocol\n      with its home location.\n\
    \   Id5.  Emergency number replacement:  There SHOULD be support for\n      replacement\
    \ of the emergency number with the appropriate emergency\n      service identifier\
    \ for each signaling protocol used for an\n      emergency call, based on local\
    \ conventions, regulations, or\n      preference (e.g., as in the case of an enterprise).\n\
    \      Motivation: Any signaling protocol requires the use of some\n      identifier\
    \ to indicate the called party, and the user equipment\n      may lack the capability\
    \ to determine the actual service URL (PSAP\n      URI).  The use of local conventions\
    \ may be required as a\n      transition mechanism.  Since relying on recognizing\
    \ local\n      numbering conventions makes it difficult for devices to be used\n\
    \      outside their home context and for external devices to be\n      introduced\
    \ into a network, protocols should use standardized\n      emergency service identifiers.\n\
    \   Id6.  Emergency service identifier marking:  Signaling protocols MUST\n  \
    \    support emergency service identifiers to mark a call as an\n      emergency\
    \ call.\n      Motivation: Marking ensures proper handling as an emergency call\n\
    \      by downstream elements that may not recognize, for example, a\n      local\
    \ variant of a logical emergency address.  This marking\n      mechanism is related\
    \ to, but independent of, marking calls for\n      prioritized call handling [RFC4412].\n\
    \   Id7.  Handling unrecognized emergency service identifiers:  There\n      MUST\
    \ be support for calls that are initiated as emergency calls\n      even if the\
    \ specific emergency service requested is not recognized\n      by the ESRP. \
    \ Such calls will then be routed to a generic\n      emergency service.\n    \
    \  Motivation: Fallback routing allows new emergency services to be\n      introduced\
    \ incrementally, while avoiding non-routable emergency\n      calls.  For example,\
    \ a call for marine rescue services would be\n      routed to a general PSAP if\
    \ the caller's location does not offer\n      marine rescue services yet.\n  \
    \ Id8.  Return fallback service identifier:  The mapping protocol MUST\n     \
    \ be able to report back the actual service mapped if the mapping\n      protocol\
    \ substitutes another service for the one requested.\n      Motivation: A mapping\
    \ server may be configured to automatically\n      look up the PSAP for another\
    \ service if the user-requested service\n      is not available for that location.\
    \  For example, if there is no\n      marine rescue service, the mapping protocol\
    \ might return the PSAP\n      URL for general emergencies and include the \"\
    urn:service.sos\"\n      identifier in the response to alert the querier to that\
    \ fact.\n   Id9.  Discovery of visited emergency numbers:  The mapping protocol\n\
    \      MUST support a mechanism to allow the end device to learn visited\n   \
    \   emergency numbers.\n      Motivation: Travelers visiting a foreign country\
    \ may observe the\n      local emergency number, e.g., seeing it painted on the\
    \ side of a\n      fire truck, and then rightfully expect to be able to dial that\n\
    \      emergency number.  Similarly, a local \"good Samaritan\" may use a\n  \
    \    tourist's cell phone to summon help.\n"
- title: 8.  Mapping Protocol
  contents:
  - "8.  Mapping Protocol\n   There are two basic approaches to invoke the mapping\
    \ protocol.  We\n   refer to these as caller-based and mediated.  In each case,\
    \ the\n   mapping client initiates a request to a mapping server via a mapping\n\
    \   protocol.  A proposed mapping protocol, LoST, is outlined in [lost].\n   For\
    \ caller-based resolution, the caller's user agent invokes the\n   mapping protocol\
    \ to determine the appropriate PSAP based on the\n   location provided.  The resolution\
    \ may take place well before the\n   actual emergency call is placed, or at the\
    \ time of the call.\n   For mediated resolution, an emergency call routing support\
    \ entity,\n   such as a SIP (outbound) proxy or redirect server, invokes the\n\
    \   mapping service.\n   Since servers may be used as outbound proxy servers by\
    \ clients that\n   are not in the same geographic area as the proxy server, any\
    \ proxy\n   server has to be able to translate any caller location to the\n  \
    \ appropriate PSAP.  (A traveler may, for example, accidentally or\n   intentionally\
    \ configure its home proxy server as its outbound proxy\n   server, even while\
    \ far away from home.)\n   Ma1.  Baseline query protocol:  A mandatory-to-implement\
    \ protocol\n      MUST be specified.\n      Motivation: An over-abundance of similarly\
    \ capable choices appears\n      undesirable for interoperability.\n   Ma2.  Extensible\
    \ protocol:  The mapping protocol MUST be designed to\n      support the extensibility\
    \ of location data elements, both for new\n      and existing fields.\n      Motivation:\
    \ This is needed, for example, to accommodate future\n      extensions-to-location\
    \ information that might be included in the\n      PIDF-LO ([RFC4119]).\n   Ma3.\
    \  Incrementally deployable:  The mapping protocol MUST be\n      designed to\
    \ support its incremental deployment.\n      Motivation: It must not be necessary,\
    \ for example, to have a\n      global street level database before deploying\
    \ the system.  It is\n      acceptable to have some misrouting of calls when the\
    \ database does\n      not (yet) contain accurate PSAP service area information.\n\
    \   Ma4.  Any time mapping:  The mapping protocol MUST support the\n      ability\
    \ of the mapping function to be invoked at any time,\n      including while an\
    \ emergency call is in process and before an\n      emergency call is initiated.\n\
    \      Motivation: If the mapping query fails at call time, it may be\n      advantageous\
    \ to be able to fall back to the result of an earlier\n      mapping query.  This\
    \ prior knowledge would be obtained by\n      performing a mapping query at any\
    \ time prior to an emergency call.\n   Ma5.  Anywhere mapping:  The mapping protocol\
    \ MUST support the\n      ability to provide mapping information in response to\
    \ an\n      individual query from any (earthly) location, regardless of where\n\
    \      the mapping client is located, either geographically or by network\n  \
    \    location.\n      Motivation: The mapping client, such as an ESRP, may not\n\
    \      necessarily be anywhere close to the caller or the appropriate\n      PSAP,\
    \ but must still be able to obtain mapping information.\n   Ma6.  Appropriate\
    \ PSAP:  The mapping protocol MUST support the\n      routing of an emergency\
    \ call to the PSAP responsible for a\n      particular geographic area.\n    \
    \  Motivation: Routing to the wrong PSAP will result in delays in\n      handling\
    \ emergencies as calls are redirected, and therefore will\n      also result in\
    \ inefficient use of PSAP resources at the initial\n      point of contact.  It\
    \ is important that the location determination\n      mechanism not be fooled\
    \ by the location of IP telephony gateways\n      or dial-in lines into a corporate\
    \ LAN (and dispatch emergency help\n      to the gateway or campus, rather than\
    \ the caller), multi-site LANs\n      and similar arrangements.\n   Ma7.  Multiple\
    \ PSAP URIs:  The mapping protocol MUST support a method\n      to return multiple\
    \ PSAP URIs, which cover the same geographic\n      area.\n      Motivation: Different\
    \ contact protocols (e.g., PSTN via tel URIs\n      and IP via SIP URIs) may be\
    \ routed to different PSAPs.  Less\n      likely, two PSAPs may overlap in their\
    \ coverage region.\n   Ma8.  Single primary URI per contact protocol:  Though\
    \ the mapping\n      protocol may be able to include multiple URIs in the response,\
    \ it\n      SHOULD return only one primary URI per contact protocol used, so\n\
    \      that clients are not required to select among different targets\n     \
    \ for the same contact protocol.\n      Motivation: There may be two or more URIs\
    \ returned when multiple\n      contact protocols are available (e.g., SIP and\
    \ SMS).  The client\n      may select among multiple contact protocols based on\
    \ its\n      capabilities, preference settings, or availability.\n   Ma9.  Non-preferred\
    \ URI schemes:  The mapping protocol MAY support\n      the return of a less-preferred\
    \ URI scheme, such as a tel URI.\n      Motivation: In order to provide incremental\
    \ support to non-IP\n      PSAPs, it may be necessary to be able to complete an\
    \ emergency\n      call via the PSTN.\n   Ma10.  URI properties:  The mapping\
    \ protocol MUST support the ability\n      to provide ancillary information about\
    \ a contact that allows the\n      mapping client to determine relevant properties\
    \ of the PSAP URI.\n      Motivation: In some cases, the same geographic area\
    \ is served by\n      several PSAPs; for example, a corporate campus might be\
    \ served by\n      both a corporate security department and the municipal PSAP.\
    \  The\n      mapping protocol should then return URIs for both, with\n      information\
    \ allowing the querying entity to choose one or the\n      other.  This determination\
    \ could be made by either an ESRP, based\n      on local policy, or by direct\
    \ user choice, in the case of caller-\n      based methods.\n   Ma11.  Mapping\
    \ referral:  The mapping protocol MUST support a\n      mechanism for the mapping\
    \ client to contact any mapping server and\n      be referred to another mapping\
    \ server that is more qualified to\n      answer the query.\n      Motivation:\
    \ Referrals help mitigate the impact of incorrect\n      configuration that directs\
    \ a client to the wrong initial mapping\n      server.\n   Ma12.  Split responsibility:\
    \  The mapping protocol MUST support the\n      division of data subset handling\
    \ between multiple mapping servers\n      within a single level of a civic location\
    \ hierarchy.\n      Motivation: For example, two mapping servers for the same\
    \ city or\n      county may handle different streets within that city or county.\n\
    \   Ma13.  URL for error reporting:  The mapping protocol MUST support\n     \
    \ the ability to return a URL that can be used to report a suspected\n      or\
    \ known error within the mapping database.\n      Motivation: If an error is returned,\
    \ for example, there needs to\n      be a URL that points to a resource that can\
    \ explain or potentially\n      help resolve the error.\n   Ma14.  Resilience\
    \ to mapping server failure:  The mapping protocol\n      MUST support a mechanism\
    \ that enables the client to fail over to\n      different (replica) mapping server.\n\
    \      Motivation: The failure of a mapping server should not preclude\n     \
    \ the mapping client from receiving an answer to its query.\n   Ma15.  Traceable\
    \ resolution:  The mapping protocol SHOULD support the\n      ability of the mapping\
    \ client to be able to determine the entity\n      or entities that provided the\
    \ emergency address resolution\n      information.\n      Motivation: To improve\
    \ reliability and performance, it is\n      important to be able to trace which\
    \ servers contributed to the\n      resolution of a query.\n   Ma16.  Minimal\
    \ additional delay:  Mapping protocol execution SHOULD\n      minimize the amount\
    \ of delay within the overall call-setup time.\n      Motivation: Since outbound\
    \ proxies will likely be asked to resolve\n      the same geographic coordinates\
    \ repeatedly, a suitable time-\n      limited caching mechanism should be supported.\n\
    \   Ma17.  Freshness indication:  The mapping protocol SHOULD support an\n   \
    \   indicator describing how current the information provided by the\n      mapping\
    \ source is.\n      Motivation: This is especially useful when an alternate mapping\
    \ is\n      requested, and alternative sources of mapping data may not have\n\
    \      been created or updated with the same set of information or within\n  \
    \    the same time frame.  Differences in currency between mapping data\n    \
    \  contained within mapping sources should be minimized.\n"
