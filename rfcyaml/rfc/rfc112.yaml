  - "          User/Server Site Protocol Network HOST Questionnaire\n            \
    \      (Reference RFC #106, NIC Note 5776)\n   Attached is a summary of the responses\
    \ to the referenced\n   questionnaires.\n   The questions involving terminal support\
    \ were of interest to members\n   of the User/Service Site Protocol Committee\
    \ in its considerations of\n   TELNET.\n   The summary points out some of the\
    \ key differences between line-at-\n   a-time and character-at-a-time (or both)\
    \ in handling terminal\n   support, especially with respect to control characters.\
    \  The\n   information may prove useful as background information to TELNET\n\
    \   implementers.\n   If errors of interpretation of any sites' answer have occurred,\n\
    \   please advise me at the following address so that I may update the\n   chart.\n\
    \   [chart: ARPA Network User Terminal Support.  Please view the PDF\n   version\
    \ of this RFC.]\n"
