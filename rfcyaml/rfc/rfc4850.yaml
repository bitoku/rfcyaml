  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) protocol,\n\
    \   described in RFC 3720, allows for extension items to the protocol in\n   the\
    \ form of Private or Public Extension Keys.  This document\n   describes a Public\
    \ Extension Key for the purpose of enhancing iSCSI\n   supportability.  The key\
    \ accomplishes this objective by allowing\n   iSCSI nodes to communicate architecture\
    \ details during the iSCSI\n   login sequence.  The receiving node can then use\
    \ this information for\n   enhanced logging and support.  This document updates\
    \ RFC 3720 to\n   allow iSCSI extension items to be defined by standards track\
    \ RFCs and\n   experimental RFCs in addition to informational RFCs.\n"

- title: 1.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview\n   This document describes a declarative Public Extension Key,\
    \ as\n   defined by Section 12.22 of RFC 3720 [2], that may be used to\n   communicate\
    \ additional iSCSI node information to the peer node in a\n   session.  The information\
    \ carried in the described key has been found\n   to be valuable in real iSCSI\
    \ customer environments as initiator and\n   target vendors collaborate to resolve\
    \ technical issues and better\n   understand the interaction of iSCSI implementations.\n\
    \   The key has been modeled after the HTTP \"Server\" and \"User-Agent\"\n  \
    \ header fields as specified in Sections 14.38 and 14.43 of RFC 2616\n   [3],\
    \ with the text-value(s) of the key roughly equivalent to Product\n   Tokens in\
    \ Section 3.8 of RFC 2616 [3].  Note, however, that the text-\n   value(s) in\
    \ the key's list-of-values MUST conform to the Text Format\n   as specified in\
    \ Section 5.1 of RFC 3720 [2].\n   The key is sent during operational parameter\
    \ negotiation of an iSCSI\n   session's login phase.  The intended use of this\
    \ key is to provide\n   enhanced logging and support capabilities, and to enable\
    \ collection\n   of iSCSI implementation and usage information.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ RFC 2119 [1].\n"
- title: 2.  Definition
  contents:
  - "2.  Definition\n   The definition of the key is as follows, conforming to Sections\
    \ 11\n   and 12 of RFC 3720 [2], with example list-of-values conforming to\n \
    \  Section 5.1 of RFC 3720 [2].\n   The key is defined with a use of \"LO\", making\
    \ it a Leading Only key,\n   and does not modify Sections 11 or 12 of RFC 3720\
    \ [2].  Thus, the key\n   MUST only be sent on the leading connection, MUST NOT\
    \ be changed\n   after the leading connection login, and MUST only be sent after\
    \ the\n   security negotiation login stage has completed (during operational\n\
    \   negotiation login stage).  The key may be sent during normal or\n   discovery\
    \ sessions.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  X#NodeArchitecture\n   Use: LO, Declarative\n   Senders: Initiator and\
    \ Target\n   Scope: SW\n   X#NodeArchitecture=<list-of-values>\n   Examples:\n\
    \      X#NodeArchitecture=ExampleOS/v1234,ExampleInc_SW_Initiator/1.05a\n    \

    \   The initiator or target declares the details of its iSCSI node\n   architecture\
    \ to the remote endpoint.  These details may include, but\n   are not limited\
    \ to, iSCSI vendor software, firmware, or hardware\n   versions, the OS version,\
    \ or hardware architecture.\n   The length of the key value (total length of the\
    \ list-of-values) MUST\n   NOT be greater than 255 bytes.\n   X#NodeArchitecture\
    \ MUST NOT be redeclared.\n"
- title: 3.  Implementation
  contents:
  - "3.  Implementation\n   Functional behavior of the iSCSI node (this includes the\
    \ iSCSI\n   protocol logic -- the SCSI, iSCSI, and TCP/IP protocols) MUST NOT\n\
    \   depend on the presence, absence, or content of the key.  The key MUST\n  \
    \ NOT be used by iSCSI nodes for interoperability, or exclusion of\n   other nodes.\
    \  To ensure proper use, key values SHOULD be set by the\n   node itself, and\
    \ there SHOULD NOT be provisions for the key values to\n   contain user-defined\
    \ text.\n   Nodes implementing this key MUST choose one of the following\n   implementation\
    \ options:\n      o  only transmit the key,\n      o  only log the key values\
    \ received from other nodes, or\n      o  both transmit and log the key values.\n\
    \   Each node choosing to implement transmission of the key values MUST\n   be\
    \ prepared to handle the response of RFC 3720 [2] compliant nodes\n   that do\
    \ not understand the key (RFC 3720 [2] states that compliant\n   nodes MUST respond\
    \ with X#NodeArchitecture=NotUnderstood).\n   Nodes that implement transmission\
    \ and/or logging of the key values\n   may also implement administrative mechanisms\
    \ that disable and/or\n   change the logging and key transmission detail (see\
    \ Security\n   Considerations).  Thus, a valid behavior for this key may be that\
    \ a\n   node is completely silent (the node does not transmit any key value,\n\
    \   and simply discards any key values it receives without issuing a\n   NotUnderstood\
    \ response).\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This extension key transmits specific implementation\
    \ details about\n   the node that sends it; such details may be considered sensitive\
    \ in\n   some environments.  For example, if a certain software or firmware\n\
    \   version is known to contain security weaknesses, announcing the\n   presence\
    \ of that version via this key may not be desirable.  The\n   countermeasures\
    \ for this security concern are:\n   o  sending less detailed information in the\
    \ key values,\n   o  not sending the extension key, or\n   o  using IPsec to provide\
    \ confidentiality for the iSCSI connection on\n      which the key is sent (see\
    \ RFC 3720 [2] and RFC 3723 [4]).\n   To support the first and second countermeasures,\
    \ all implementations\n   of this extension key MUST provide an administrative\
    \ mechanism to\n   disable sending the key.  In addition, all implementations\
    \ SHOULD\n   provide an administrative mechanism to configure a verbosity level\
    \ of\n   the key value, thereby controlling the amount of information sent.\n\
    \   For example, a lower verbosity might enable transmission of node\n   architecture\
    \ component names only, but no version numbers.\n   The choice of which countermeasure\
    \ is most appropriate depends on the\n   environment.  However, sending less detailed\
    \ information in the key\n   values may be an acceptable countermeasure in many\
    \ environments,\n   since it provides a compromise between sending too much information\n\
    \   and the other more complete countermeasures of not sending the key at\n  \
    \ all or using IPsec.\n   In addition to security considerations involving transmission\
    \ of the\n   key contents, any logging method(s) used for the key values MUST\
    \ keep\n   the information secure from intruders.  For all implementations, the\n\
    \   requirements to address this security concern are:\n   o  Display of the log\
    \ MUST only be possible with administrative\n      rights to the node.\n   o \
    \ Options to disable logging to disk and to keep logs for a fixed\n      duration\
    \ SHOULD be provided.\n   Finally, it is important to note that different nodes\
    \ may have\n   different levels of risk, and these differences may affect the\n\
    \   implementation.  The components of risk include assets, threats, and\n   vulnerabilities.\
    \  Consider the following example iSCSI nodes, which\n   demonstrate differences\
    \ in assets and vulnerabilities of the nodes,\n   and as a result, differences\
    \ in implementation:\n   o  One iSCSI target based on a special-purpose operating\
    \ system.\n      Since the iSCSI target controls access to the data storage\n\
    \      containing company assets, the asset level is seen as very high.\n    \
    \  Also, because of the special-purpose operating system, in which\n      vulnerabilities\
    \ are less well-known, the vulnerability level is\n      viewed as low.\n   o\
    \  Multiple iSCSI initiators in a blade farm, each running a general-\n      purpose\
    \ operating system.  The asset level of each node is viewed\n      as low, since\
    \ blades are replaceable and low cost.  However, the\n      vulnerability level\
    \ is viewed as high, since there are many well-\n      known vulnerabilities to\
    \ the general-purpose operating system.\n   For the above target, an appropriate\
    \ implementation might be logging\n   of received key values, but no transmission\
    \ of the key.  For the\n   initiators, an appropriate implementation might be\
    \ transmission of\n   the key, but no logging of received key values.\n"

    \ same effect as if the following changes were\n   made to the text of RFC 3720\
    \ (RFC text cannot be changed after\n   publication):\n   1) In Section 11.1,\
    \ the requirement that Z# Authentication methods\n      \"MUST be described by\

    \ track RFC, an experimental RFC, or an\n      informational RFC.\"\n   2) In\

    \ track RFC, an experimental RFC, or an\n      informational RFC.\"\n   3) In\
    \ Section 12.22, the requirement that X# text keys \"MUST be\n      described\
    \ by an informational RFC.\" is changed to \"MUST be\n      described by a standards\
    \ track RFC, an experimental RFC, or an\n      informational RFC.\"\n   4) In\
    \ Section 13.3, the description of allowed RFC types for\n      extension items\
    \ is changed from \"The RFC may be informational\n      rather than Standards-Track,\"\
    \ to \"The RFC MUST be standards track,\n      experimental, or informational,\"\
    \n   5) In Section 13.5.2, the phrase \"standards track\" is changed to\n    \
    \  \"standards track or experimental\" in the last sentence of the\n      first\
    \ paragraph, so that the sentence reads: \"If the specification\n      is a standards\
    \ track or experimental document, the usual IETF\n      procedures for such documents\
    \ are followed.\"\n   The registries for iSCSI extension items should be managed\
    \ as if\n   these changes had been made to the text of RFC 3720.\n"
