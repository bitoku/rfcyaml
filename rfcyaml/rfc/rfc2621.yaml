    \ in the Internet community.  Using these extensions IP-based\n   management stations\
    \ can manage RADIUS accounting servers.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n\
    \   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing RADIUS\n   accounting\
    \ servers.\n   RADIUS accounting servers are today widely deployed by dialup\n\
    \   Internet Service Providers, in order to provide accounting services.\n   As\
    \ a result, the effective management of RADIUS accounting servers is\n   of considerable\
    \ importance.\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n    o   An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [1].\n    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure\
    \ of\n        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in\n\
    \        STD 15, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].\n      \
    \  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC\n        2578\
    \ [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].\n    o   Message protocols for transferring\
    \ management information. The\n        first version of the SNMP message protocol\
    \ is called SNMPv1 and\n        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version\
    \ of the\n        SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards\n\
    \        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901\n       \
    \ [9] and RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message\n        protocol is\
    \ called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC\n        2572 [11] and RFC\
    \ 2574 [12].\n    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.\
    \ The\n        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n\
    \        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol\n       \
    \ operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n        [13].\n\
    \    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and\n  \
    \      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575\n       \
    \ [15].\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n\
    \   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined\
    \ using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module\
    \ that is compliant to the SMIv2. A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced\
    \ through the appropriate\n   translations. The resulting translated MIB must\
    \ be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because\
    \ no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable\n \
    \  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1\
    \ during the translation process. However, this loss of machine\n   readable information\
    \ is not considered to change the semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   The RADIUS accounting protocol, described in [16], distinguishes\n\
    \   between the client function and the server function. In RADIUS\n   accounting,\
    \ clients send Accounting-Requests, and servers reply with\n   Accounting-Responses.\
    \  Typically NAS devices implement the client\n   function, and thus would be\
    \ expected to implement the RADIUS\n   accounting client MIB, while RADIUS accounting\
    \ servers implement the\n   server function, and thus would be expected to implement\
    \ the RADIUS\n   accounting server MIB.\n   However, it is possible for a RADIUS\
    \ accounting entity to perform\n   both client and server functions. For example,\
    \ a RADIUS proxy may act\n   as a server to one or more RADIUS accounting clients,\
    \ while\n   simultaneously acting as an accounting client to one or more\n   accounting\
    \ servers.  In such situations, it is expected that RADIUS\n   entities combining\
    \ client and server functionality will support both\n   the client and server\
    \ MIBs.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Selected objects
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Selected objects\n   This MIB module contains thirteen scalars as well\
    \ as a single table:\n   (1)  the RADIUS Accounting Client Table contains one\
    \ row for each\n        RADIUS accounting client that the server shares a secret\
    \ with.\n   Each entry in the RADIUS Accounting Client Table includes eleven\n\
    \   columns presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS accounting\n   server.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are management objects (radiusAccServConfigReset)\
    \ defined in\n   this MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-\n\
    \   create.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in\n   some\
    \ network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-\n   secure environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative\n   effect on network operations.\n\
    \   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain\n   sensitive\
    \ information. These are:\n   radiusAccClientAddress\n             This can be\
    \ used to determine the address of the RADIUS\n             accounting client\
    \ with which the server is communicating.\n             This information could\
    \ be useful in impersonating the\n             client.\n   radiusAccClientID This\
    \ can be used to determine the client ID for the\n             accounting client\
    \ with which the server is communicating.\n             This information could\
    \ be useful in impersonating the\n             client.\n   It is thus important\
    \ to control even GET access to these objects and\n   possibly to even encrypt\
    \ the values of these object when sending them\n   over the network via SNMP.\
    \  Not all versions of SNMP provide features\n   for such a secure environment.\n\
    \   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network\n   itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as\n   to who on\
    \ the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET\n   (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementers consider\
    \ the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically,\
    \ the use\n   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based\n\
    \   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.  Using these\n   security\
    \ features, customer/users can give access to the objects only\n   to those principals\
    \ (users) that have legitimate rights to GET or SET\n   (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
