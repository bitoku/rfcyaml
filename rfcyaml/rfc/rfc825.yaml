  - "             Request for Comments on Requests for Comments\nThis RFC is intended\
    \ to clarify the status of RFCs and to provide some\nguidance for the authors\
    \ of RFCs in the future.  It is in a sense a\nspecification for RFCs.\nThere are\
    \ several reasons for publishing a memo as an RFC, for example,\nto make available\
    \ some information for interested people, or to begin or\ncontinue a discussion\
    \ of an interesting idea, or to specify a protocol.\nEach RFC is to include on\
    \ its title page or in the first or second\nparagraph a statement describing the\
    \ intention of the RFC.\n   The following sample paragraphs may be used to satisfy\
    \ this\n   requirement:\n      Specification\n         This RFC specifies a standard\
    \ for the ARPA Internet community.\n         Hosts on the ARPA Internet are expected\
    \ to adopt and implement\n         this standard.\n      Discussion\n        \
    \ The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on particular\n         problems\
    \ in the ARPA Internet and possible methods of solution.\n         No proposed\
    \ solutions this document are intended as standards\n         at this time.  Rather,\
    \ it is hoped that a general consensus\n         will emerge as to the appropriate\
    \ solution to such problems,\n         leading eventually to the adoption of standards.\n\
    \      Information\n         This RFC is presented to members of the ARPA Internet\
    \ community\n         in order to solicit their reactions to the proposals contained\n\
    \         in it.  While perhaps the issues discussed are not directly\n      \
    \   relevant to the research problems of the ARPA Internet, they\n         may\
    \ be particularly interesting to some researchers and\n         implementers.\n\
    RFC on RFCs                                                             \n   \
    \   Status\n         This RFC is issued in response to the need for current\n\
    \         information about the status and progress of various projects\n    \
    \     in the ARPA Internet community.  The information contained in\n        \
    \ this document is accurate as of the date of publication, but is\n         subject\
    \ to change.  Subsequent RFCs may reflect such changes.\n      Report\n      \
    \   This RFC is issued to report on the results of a meeting.  It\n         may\
    \ document significant decisions made that impact the\n         implementation\
    \ of network protocols, or limit or expand the use\n         of optional features\
    \ of protocols.  Other meeting results may\n         be indicated including (but\
    \ not limited to) policy issues,\n         technical topics discussed and problems\
    \ needing further work.\n   Of course these paragraphs need not be followed word\
    \ for word, but\n   the general intent of the RFC must be made clear.\nRFCs are\
    \ distributed online by being stored as public access files, and\na short messages\
    \ is sent to the distribution list indicating the\navailability of the memo.\n\
    The online files are copied by the interested people and printed or\ndisplayed\
    \ at their site on their equipment.  This means that the format\nof the online\
    \ files must meet the constraints of a wide variety of\nprinting and display equipment.\n\
    To meet these constraints the following rules are established for the\nformat\
    \ of RFCs:\n   The character codes are ASCII.\n   Each page must be limited to\
    \ 58 lines followed by a form feed on a\n   line by itself.\n   Each line must\
    \ be limited to 72 characters followed by carriage\n   return and line feed.\n\
    \   No overstriking (or underlining) is allowed.\n   These \"height\" and \"width\"\
    \ constraints include any headers, footers,\n   page numbers, or left side indenting.\n\
    Requests to be added to or deleted from this distribution list should be\nsent\
    \ to NIC@SRI-NIC.  Submissions for RFCs should be sent to\nPOSTEL@USC-ISIF.\n"
