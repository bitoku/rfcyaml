- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The FYI series of notes is designed to provide Internet\
    \ users with a\n   central repository of information about any topics which relate\
    \ to\n   the Internet.  FYIs topics may range from historical memos on \"Why it\n\
    \   was was done this way\" to answers to commonly asked operational\n   questions.\n\
    \   The FYIs are intended for a wide audience.  Some FYIs will cater to\n   beginners,\
    \ while others will discuss more advanced topics.  An FYI\n   may be submitted\
    \ by anyone who has something to contribute and has\n   the time to do so.\n"
- title: 2.  Why RFCs
  contents:
  - "2.  Why RFCs\n   There are several reasons why the FYIs are part of the larger\
    \ RFC\n   series of notes.  The formost reason is that the distribution\n   mechanisms\
    \ for RFCs are tried and true.  Anyone who can get an RFC,\n   can automatically\
    \ get an FYI.  More importantly, anyone who knows of\n   the RFC series, can easily\
    \ find out about the FYIs.\n   Another reason for making FYIs part of the RFC\
    \ series is that the\n   maintainance mechanisms for RFCs are already in place\
    \ and funded.  It\n   makes sense to maintain similar documents is a similar way.\
    \  After\n   all, there have been informational RFCs before.\n   Finally, the\
    \ name RFC has come to carry a meaning with it.  There is\n   credibility associated\
    \ memos carrying the RFC label.  FYIs should\n   share that respect.\n"
- title: 3.  Format Rules
  contents:
  - "3.  Format Rules\n   Since the FYIs are a part of the RFC series, they must conform\
    \ to\n   RFC-1111 (Request for Comments on Request for Comments: Instructions\n\
    \   to RFC Authors) with respect to format.  Ideally, they should be\n   submitted\
    \ in ASCII format, as described by section 2a, of RFC-1111.\n"
- title: 4.  Status Statement
  contents:
  - "4.  Status Statement\n   Each RFC must include on its first page the \"Status\
    \ of this Memo\"\n   section which contains a paragraph describing the intention\
    \ of the\n   RFC.  This section is meant to convey the status granted by the RFC\n\
    \   Editor and the Internet Activities Board (IAB).  There are several\n   reasons\
    \ for publishing a memo as an RFC, for example, to make\n   available some information\
    \ for interested people, or to begin or\n   continue a discussion of an interesting\
    \ idea, or to make available\n   the specification of a protocol.\n   For example:\n\
    \   This RFC is the first in a new sub-series of RFCs called FYIs (For\n   Your\
    \ Information).  This memo provides information for the Internet\n   community.\
    \  It does not specify any standard.  Distribution of this\n   memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: 5.  Distribution Statement
  contents:
  - "5.  Distribution Statement\n   Each FYI is to also include a \"distribution statement\"\
    .  As the\n   purpose of the FYI series is to disseminate information, there is\
    \ no\n   reason for the distribution to be anything other than \"unlimited\".\n\
    \   Typically, the distribution statement will simply be the sentence\n   \"Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\" appended to the \"Status of\n   this Memo\" section.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   All FYIs must contain a section that discusses\
    \ the security\n   considerations of the procedures that are the main topic of\
    \ the RFC.\n"
- title: 7.  Author's Address
  contents:
  - "7.  Author's Address\n   Each FYI must have at the very end a section giving\
    \ the author's\n   address, including the name and postal address, the telephone\
    \ number,\n   and the Internet email address.\n"
- title: 8.  Relation to other FYIs
  contents:
  - "8.  Relation to other FYIs\n   Sometimes an FYI adds information on a topic discussed\
    \ in a previous\n   FYI or completely replaces an earlier FYI.  There are two\
    \ terms used\n   for these cases respectively, UPDATES and OBSOLETES.  A document\
    \ that\n   obsoletes an earlier document can stand on its own.  A document that\n\
    \   merely updates an earlier document cannot stand on its own; it is\n   something\
    \ that must be added to or inserted into the existing\n   document, and has limited\
    \ usefulness independently.\n   UPDATES\n      To be used as a reference from\
    \ a new item that cannot be used\n      alone (i.e., one that supplements a previous\
    \ document), to refer\n      to the previous document.  The newer publication\
    \ is a part that\n      will supplement or be added on to the existing document;\
    \ e.g., an\n      addendum, or separate, extra information that is to be added\
    \ to\n      the original document.\n   OBSOLETES\n      To be used to refer to\
    \ an earlier document that is replaced by\n      this document.  This document\
    \ contains either revised information,\n      or else all of the same information\
    \ plus some new information,\n      however extensive or brief that new information\
    \ is; i.e., this\n      document can be used alone, without reference to the older\n\
    \      document.\n   OBSOLETED-BY\n      To be used to refer to the newer document\
    \ that replaces the older\n      document.\n   UPDATED-BY\n      To be used to\
    \ refer to the newer document that adds information to\n      the existing, still\
    \ useful, document.\n"

- title: 11.  Obtaining FYIs
  contents:
  - "11.  Obtaining FYIs\n   FYIs can be obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the\
    \ pathname\n   FYI:mm.TXT, or RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT (where \"mm\" refers to the number\
    \ of\n   the FYI and \"nnnn\" refers to the number of the RFC).  Login with FTP,\n\
    \   username ANONYMOUS and password GUEST.  The NIC also provides an\n   automatic\
    \ mail service for those sites which cannot use FTP.  Address\n   the request\
    \ to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and in the subject field of the\n   message indicate\
    \ the FYI or RFC number, as in \"Subject: FYI mm\" or\n   \"Subject: RFC nnnn\"\
