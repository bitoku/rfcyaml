- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Some vendors of consumer electronics and network gear have\n\
    \   unfortunately chosen to embed, or \"hard-code\", globally-routable\n   Internet\
    \ Protocol addresses within their products' firmware.  These\n   embedded IP addresses\
    \ are typically individual server IP addresses or\n   IP subnet prefixes.  Thus,\
    \ they are sometimes used as service\n   identifiers, to which unsolicted requests\
    \ are directed, or as subnet\n   identifiers, specifying sets of Internet addresses\
    \ that the given\n   product somehow treats specially.\n   One recent example\
    \ was the embedding of the globally-routable IP\n   address of a Network Time\
    \ Protocol server in the firmware of hundreds\n   of thousands of Internet hosts\
    \ that are now in operation worldwide.\n   The hosts are primarily, but are not\
    \ necessarily, limited to low-cost\n   routers and middleboxes for personal or\
    \ residential use.  In another\n   case, IP address prefixes that had once been\
    \ reserved by the Internet\n   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) were embedded\
    \ in a router product\n   so that it can automatically discard packets that appear\
    \ to have\n   invalid source IP addresses.\n   Such \"hard-coding\" of globally-routable\
    \ IP addresses as identifiers\n   within the host's firmware presents significant\
    \ problems to the\n   operation of the Internet and to the management of its address\
    \ space.\n   Ostensibly, this practice arose as an attempt to simplify IP host\n\
    \   configuration by pre-loading hosts with IP addresses.  Products that\n   rely\
    \ on such embedded IP addresses initially may appear to be\n   convenient to the\
    \ product's designer and to its operator or user, but\n   this dubious benefit\
    \ comes at the expense of others in the Internet\n   community.\n   This document\
    \ denounces the practice of embedding references to\n   unique, globally-routable\
    \ IP addresses in Internet hosts, describes\n   some of the resulting problems,\
    \ and considers selected alternatives.\n   It also reminds the Internet community\
    \ of the ephemeral nature of\n   unique, globally-routable IP addresses; the assignment\
    \ and use of IP\n   addresses as identifiers is temporary and therefore should\
    \ not be\n   used in fixed configurations.\n"
- title: 2.  Problems
  contents:
  - "2.  Problems\n   The embedding of IP addresses in products has caused an increasing\n\
    \   number of Internet hosts to rely on a single central Internet\n   service.\
    \  This can result in a service outage when the aggregate\n   workload overwhelms\
    \ that service.  When fixed addresses are embedded\n   in an ever-increasing number\
    \ of client IP hosts, this practice runs\n   directly counter to the design intent\
    \ of hierarchically deployed\n   services that would otherwise be robust solutions.\n\
    \   The reliability, scalability, and performance of many Internet\n   services\
    \ require that the pool of users not access a service using\n   its IP address\
    \ directly.  Instead, they typically rely on a level of\n   indirection provided\
    \ by the Domain Name System, RFC 2219 [6].  When\n   appropriately utilized, the\
    \ DNS permits the service operator to\n   reconfigure the resources for maintenance\
    \ and to perform load\n   balancing, without the participation of the users and\
    \ without a\n   requirement for configuration changes in the client hosts.  For\n\
    \   instance, one common load-balancing technique employs multiple DNS\n   records\
    \ with the same name; the set of answers that is returned is\n   rotated in a\
    \ round-robin fashion in successive queries.  Upon\n   receiving such a response\
    \ to a query, resolvers typically will try\n   the answers in order, until one\
    \ succeeds, thus enabling the operator\n   to distribute the user request load\
    \ across a set of servers with\n   discrete IP addresses that generally remain\
    \ unknown to the user.\n   Embedding globally-unique IP addresses taints the IP\
    \ address blocks\n   in which they reside, lessening the usefulness and mobility\
    \ of those\n   IP address blocks and increasing the cost of operation.  Unsolicited\n\
    \   traffic may continue to be delivered to the embedded address well\n   after\
    \ the IP address or block has been reassigned and no longer hosts\n   the service\
    \ for which that traffic was intended.  Circa 1997, the\n   authors of RFC 2101\
    \ [7] made this observation:\n      Due to dynamic address allocation and increasingly\
    \ frequent\n      network renumbering, temporal uniqueness of IPv4 addresses is\
    \ no\n      longer globally guaranteed, which puts their use as identifiers\n\
    \      into severe question.\n   When IP addresses are embedded in the configuration\
    \ of many Internet\n   hosts, the IP address blocks become encumbered by their\
    \ historical\n   use.  This may interfere with the ability of the Internet Assigned\n\
    \   Numbers Authority (IANA) and the Internet Registry (IR) hierarchy to\n   usefully\
    \ reallocate IP address blocks.  Likewise, to facilitate IP\n   address reuse,\
    \ RFC 2050 [1], encourages Internet Service Providers\n   (ISPs) to treat address\
    \ assignments as \"loans\".\n   Because consumers are not necessarily experienced\
    \ in the operation of\n   Internet hosts, they cannot be relied upon to fix problems,\
    \ if and\n   when they arise.  Therefore, a significant responsibility lies with\n\
    \   the manufacturer or vendor of an Internet host to avoid embedding IP\n   addresses\
    \ in ways that cause the aforementioned problems.\n"
- title: 3.  Recommendations
  contents:
  - "3.  Recommendations\n   Internet host and router designers, including network\
    \ product\n   manufacturers, should not assume that their products will be deployed\n\
    \   and used in only the single global Internet that they happen to\n   observe\
    \ today.  A myriad of private or future internetworks in which\n   these products\
    \ will be used may not allow those hosts to establish\n   communications with\
    \ arbitrary hosts on the global Internet.  Since\n   the product failure modes\
    \ resulting from an unknown future\n   internetwork environment cannot be fully\
    \ explored, one should avoid\n   assumptions regarding the longevity of our current\
    \ Internet.\n   The following recommendations are presented as best practice today.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Disable Unused Features
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Disable Unused Features\n   Vendors should, by default, disable unnecessary\
    \ features in their\n   products.  This is especially true of features that generate\n\
    \   unsolicited Internet traffic.  In this way, these hosts will be\n   conservative\
    \ regarding the unsolicited Internet traffic they produce.\n   For instance, one\
    \ of the most common uses of embedded IP addresses\n   has been the hard-coding\
    \ of addresses of well known public Simple\n   Network Time Protocol (SNTP RFC\
    \ 2030 [8]) servers in products.\n   However, only a small fraction of users will\
    \ benefit from these\n   products having some notion of the current date and time.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Provide User Interface for IP Features
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Provide User Interface for IP Features\n   Vendors should provide an operator\
    \ interface for every feature that\n   generates unsolicited Internet traffic.\
    \  A prime example is this:\n   the Domain Name System resolver should have an\
    \ interface enabling the\n   operator to either explicitly set the choice of servers\
    \ or enable a\n   standard automated configuration protocol such as DHCP, defined\
    \ by\n   RFC 2132 [9].  These features should originally be disabled within\n\
    \   the operator interface, and subsequently enabling these features\n   should\
    \ alert the operator that the feature exists.  This will make it\n   more likely\
    \ that the product's owner or operator can participate in\n   problem determination\
    \ and mitigation when problems arise.\n   RFC 2606 [2] defines the IANA-reserved\
    \ \"example.com\", \"example.net\",\n   and \"example.org\" domains for use in\
    \ example configurations and\n   documentation.  These are candidate examples\
    \ to be used in user\n   interface documentation.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Use Domain Names as Service Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Use Domain Names as Service Identifiers\n   Internet hosts should use the\
    \ Domain Name System to determine the IP\n   addresses associated with the Internet\
    \ services they require.\n   When using domain names as service identifiers in\
    \ the configurations\n   of deployed Internet hosts, designers and vendors are\
    \ encouraged to\n   introduce service names.  These names should be within a domain\
    \ that\n   they either control or are permitted to utilize by an agreement with\n\
    \   its operator (such as for public services provided by the Internet\n   community).\
    \  This is commonly done by introducing a service-specific\n   prefix to the domain\
    \ name.\n   For instance, a vendor named \"Example, Inc.\" with the domain\n \
    \  \"example.com\" might configure its product to find its SNTP server by\n  \
    \ the name \"sntp-server.config.example.com\" or even by a name that is\n   specific\
    \ to the product and version, such as \"sntp-\n   server.v1.widget.config.example.com\"\
    .  Here the \"config.example.com\"\n   namespace is dedicated to that vendor's\
    \ product configuration, with\n   subdomains introduced as deemed necessary. \
    \ Such special-purpose\n   domain names enable ongoing maintenance and reconfiguration\
    \ of the\n   services for their client hosts and can aid in the ongoing\n   measurement\
    \ of service usage throughout the product's lifetime.\n   An alternative to inventing\
    \ vendor-specific domain naming conventions\n   for a product's service identifiers\
    \ is to utilize SRV resource\n   records (RRs), defined by RFC 2782 [10].  SRV\
    \ records are a generic\n   type of RR that uses a service-specific prefix in\
    \ combination with a\n   base domain name.  For example, an SRV-cognizant SNTP\
    \ client might\n   discover Example, Inc.'s suggested NTP server by performing\
    \ an SRV-\n   type query to lookup for \"_ntp._udp.example.com\".\n   However,\
    \ note that simply hard-coding DNS name service identifiers\n   rather than IP\
    \ addresses is not a panacea.  Entries in the domain\n   name space are also ephemeral\
    \ and can change owners for various\n   reasons, including acquisitions and litigation.\
    \  As such, developers\n   and vendors should explore a product's potential failure\
    \ modes\n   resulting from the loss of administrative control of a given domain\n\
    \   for whatever reason.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Use Special-Purpose, Reserved IP Addresses When Available
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Use Special-Purpose, Reserved IP Addresses When Available\n   Default configurations,\
    \ documentation, and example configurations for\n   Internet hosts should use\
    \ Internet addresses that reside within\n   special blocks that have been reserved\
    \ for these purposes, rather\n   than unique, globally-routable IP addresses.\
    \  For IPv4, RFC 3330 [3]\n   states that the 192.0.2.0/24 block has been assigned\
    \ for use in\n   documentation and example code.  The IPv6 global unicast address\n\
    \   prefix 2001:DB8::/32 has been similarly reserved for documentation\n   purposes\
    \ RFC 3849 [4].  Private Internet Addresses, as defined by RFC\n   1918 [5], should\
    \ not be used for such purposes.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Discover and Utilize Local Services
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Discover and Utilize Local Services\n   Service providers and enterprise\
    \ network operators should advertise\n   the identities of suitable local services,\
    \ such as NTP.  Very often\n   these services exist, but the advertisement and\
    \ automated\n   configuration of their use is missing.  For instance, the DHCP\n\
    \   protocol, as defined by RFC 2132 [9], enables one to configure a\n   server\
    \ to answer client queries for service identifiers.  When local\n   services,\
    \ including NTP, are available but not pervasively advertised\n   using such common\
    \ protocols, designers are more likely to deploy ad\n   hoc initialization mechanisms\
    \ that unnecessarily rely on central\n   services.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Avoid Mentioning the IP Addresses of Services
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Avoid Mentioning the IP Addresses of Services\n   Operators who provide\
    \ public services on the global Internet, such as\n   those in the NTP community,\
    \ should deprecate the explicit\n   advertisement of the IP addresses of public\
    \ services.  These\n   addresses are ephemeral.  As such, their widespread citation\
    \ in\n   public service indexes interferes with the ability to reconfigure the\n\
    \   service when necessary to address unexpected, increased traffic and\n   the\
    \ aforementioned problems.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Embedding or \"hard-coding\" IP addresses within\
    \ a host's configuration\n   often means that a host-based trust model is being\
    \ employed, and that\n   the Internet host with the given address is trusted in\
    \ some way.  Due\n   to the ephemeral roles of globally-routable IP addresses,\
    \ the\n   practice of embedding them within products' firmware or default\n  \
    \ configurations presents a security risk in which unknown parties may\n   be\
    \ trusted inadvertently.\n   Internet host designers may be tempted to implement\
    \ some sort of\n   remote control mechanism within a product, by which its Internet\
    \ host\n   configuration can be changed without reliance on, interaction with,\n\
    \   or even the knowledge of, its operator or user.  This raises security\n  \
    \ issues of its own.  If such a scheme is implemented, its presence\n   should\
    \ be fully disclosed to the customer, operator, and user, so\n   that an informed\
    \ decision can be made, perhaps in accordance with\n   local security or privacy\
    \ policy.  Furthermore, the significant\n   possibility of malicious parties exploiting\
    \ such a remote control\n   mechanism may completely negate any potential benefit\
    \ of the remote\n   control scheme.  Therefore, remote control mechanisms should\
    \ be\n   disabled by default, to be subsequently enabled and disabled by the\n\
    \   user.\n"
- title: 5.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "5.  Conclusion\n   When large numbers of homogeneous Internet hosts are deployed,\
    \ it is\n   particularly important that both their designers and other members\
    \ of\n   the Internet community diligently assess host implementation quality\n\
    \   and reconfigurability.\n   Implementors of host services should avoid any\
    \ kind of use of unique\n   globally-routable IP addresses within a fixed configuration\
    \ part of\n   the service implementation.  If there is a requirement for pre-\n\
    \   configured state, then care should be taken to use an appropriate\n   service\
    \ identifier and to use standard mechanisms for dynamically\n   resolving the\
    \ identifier into an IP address.  Also, any such\n   identifiers should be alterable\

  - "Appendix A.  Background\n   In May 2003, the University of Wisconsin discovered\
    \ that a network\n   product vendor named NetGear had manufactured and shipped\
    \ over\n   700,000 routers with firmware containing a hard-coded reference to\n\
    \   the IP address of one of the University's  NTP servers:\n   128.105.39.11,\
    \ which was also known as \"ntp1.cs.wisc.edu\", a public\n   stratum-2 NTP server.\n\
    \   Due to that embedded fixed configuration and an unrelated bug in the\n   SNTP\
    \ client, the affected products occasionally exhibit a failure\n   mode in which\
    \ each flawed router produces one query per second\n   destined for the IP address\
    \ 128.105.39.11, and hence produces a large\n   scale flood of Internet traffic\
    \ from hundreds of thousands of source\n   addresses, destined for the University's\
