Abstract This memo defines OBJECT IDENTIFIER values for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it contains registered OID values for use with the dot3StatsEtherChipSet object in the EtherLike MIB [16].
These registrations have been split from [16] into a separate document for maintenance purposes.
This memo defines OBJECT IDENTIFIER values for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it contains registered OID values for use with the dot3StatsEtherChipSet object in the EtherLike MIB [16].
These registrations have been split from [16] into a separate document for maintenance purposes.
The dot3StatsEtherChipSet object has recently been deprecated.
The purpose of this document is to capture historic assignments made by the various IETF working groups that have been responsible for maintaining the EtherLike MIB.
Implementations which support the dot3StatsEtherChipSet object for backwards compatability may continue to use the OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned in this document.
For those chipsets not represented in this document, implementors should assign OBJECT IDENTIFIER values within that part of the registration tree delegated to individual enterprises.
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

This MIB module contains registered values for use by the dot3StatsEtherChipSet object in the EtherLike MIB.
This object is used to identify the MAC hardware used to communicate on an interface.
Note that the dot3StatsEtherChipSet object has been deprecated.
The primary purpose of this module is to capture historic assignments made by the various IETF working groups that have been responsible for maintaining the EtherLike MIB.
Implementations which support the dot3StatsEtherChipSet object for backwards compatability may continue to use these values.
For those chipsets not represented in this module, registration is required in other documentation, e.g., assignment within that part of the registration tree delegated to individual enterprises (see RFC 1155 and RFC 1902)."

There are no management objects actually defined in this MIB module.
It merely contains a list of OBJECT IDENTIFIER values for use in other MIB modules.
As such, it does not, by itself, have any effect on the security of the Internet.
The values in this module are expected to be used only for backwards compatability with the deprecated dot3StatsEtherChipSet object in the EtherLike MIB [16].
That object may be considered sensitive in some environments, since it would allow an intruder to obtain information about which vendor's equipment is in use on the network.
Therefore, it may be important in some environments, where the dot3StatsEtherChipSet object is implemented for backwards compatability, to control read access to that object and possibly to even encrypt the values of that object when sending it over the network via SNMP.
Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.
by itself is such an insecure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET (read)
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View based Access Control Model RFC 2575
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to a managed object whose values are defined in this MIB, is properly configured to give access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
