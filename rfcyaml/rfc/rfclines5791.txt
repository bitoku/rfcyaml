Abstract This document obsoletes RFC 2731
, "Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML", as further development of this specification has moved to the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI).
Introduction [RFC2731] defines "Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML".
Newer specifications published by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (http://dublincore.org/) over the last decade, in particular "Expressing Dublin Core metadata using HTML/XHTML meta and link elements" ([DC HTML]), have obsoleted this work.
Note: Implementers of RFC 2731 should note that DC HTML introduces a new requirement with respect to the use of the "head" element's "profile" attribute.
This document is of administrative nature only and therefore there are no security relations related to it.
