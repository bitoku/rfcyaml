  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet is moving towards the deployment of an OSI\
    \ lower layers\n   infrastructure. This infrastructure comprises the connectionless\n\
    \   network protocol (CLNP) [6] and supporting routing protocols. Also\n   required\
    \ as part of this infrastructure is support in the Domain Name\n   System (DNS)\
    \ [8] [9] for mapping between domain names and OSI Network\n   Service Access\
    \ Point (NSAP) addresses [7] [Note: NSAP and NSAP\n   address are used interchangeably\
    \ throughout this memo].\n   This document defines the format of one new Resource\
    \ Record (RR) for\n   the DNS for domain name-to-NSAP mapping. The RR may be used\
    \ with any\n   NSAP address format.\n   NSAP-to-name translation is accomplished\
    \ through use of the PTR RR\n   (see RFC 1035 for a description of the PTR RR).\
    \ This paper describes\n   how PTR RRs are used to support this translation.\n\
    \   This memo assumes that the reader is familiar with the DNS. Some\n   familiarity\
    \ with NSAPs is useful; see [2] or [7] for additional\n   information.\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   The reason for defining DNS mappings for NSAPs is to support\
    \ CLNP in\n   the Internet. Debugging with CLNP ping and traceroute is becoming\n\
    \   more difficult with only numeric NSAPs as the scale of deployment\n   increases.\
    \ Current debugging is supported by maintaining and\n   exchanging a configuration\
    \ file with name/NSAP mappings similar in\n   function to hosts.txt. This suffers\
    \ from the lack of a central\n   coordinator for this file and also from the perspective\
    \ of scaling.\n   The former is the most serious short-term problem. Scaling of\
    \ a\n   hosts.txt-like solution has well-known long-term scaling\n   difficiencies.\n\
    \   A second reason for this work is the proposal to use CLNP as an\n   alternative\
    \ to IP: \"TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses (TUBA), A\n   Simple Proposal for\
    \ Internet Addressing and Routing\" [1]. For this to\n   be practical, the DNS\
    \ must be capable of supporting CLNP addresses.\n"
- title: 3.  Scope
  contents:
  - "3.  Scope\n   The methods defined in this paper are applicable to all NSAP formats.\n\
    \   This includes support for the notion of a custom-defined NSAP format\n   based\
    \ on an AFI obtained by the IAB for use in the Internet.\n   As a point of reference,\
    \ there is a distinction between registration\n   and publication of addresses.\
    \ For IP addresses, the IANA is the root\n   registration authority and the DNS\
    \ a publication method. For NSAPs,\n   addendum two of the network service definition,\
    \ ISO8348/Ad2 [7] is\n   the root registration authority and this memo defines\
    \ how the DNS is\n   used as a publication method.\n"
- title: 4.  Structure of NSAPs
  contents:
  - "4.  Structure of NSAPs\n   NSAPs are hierarchically structured to allow distributed\n\
    \   administration and efficient routing. Distributed administration\n   permits\
    \ subdelegated addressing authorities to, as allowed by the\n   delegator, further\
    \ structure the portion of the NSAP space under\n   their delegated control. \
    \ Accomodating this distributed authority\n   requires that there be little or\
    \ no a priori knowledge of the\n   structure of NSAPs built into DNS resolvers\
    \ and servers.\n   For the purposes of this memo, NSAPs can be thought of as a\
    \ tree of\n   identifiers. The root of the tree is ISO8348/Ad2 [7], and has as\
    \ its\n   immediately registered subordinates the one-octet Authority and\n  \
    \ Format Identifiers (AFIs) defined there. The size of subsequently-\n   defined\
    \ fields depends on which branch of the tree is taken. The\n   depth of the tree\
    \ varies according to the authority responsible for\n   defining subsequent fields.\n\
    \   An example is the authority under which U.S. GOSIP defines NSAPs [3].\n  \
    \ Under the AFI of 47, NIST (National Institute of Standards and\n   Technology)\
    \ obtained a value of 0005 (the AFI of 47 defines the next\n   field as being\
    \ two octets consisting of four BCD digits from the\n   International Code Designator\
    \ space [4]). NIST defined the subsequent\n   fields in [3], as shown in Figure\
    \ 1. The field immediately following\n   0005 is a format identifier for the rest\
    \ of the U.S. GOSIP NSAP\n   structure, with a hex value of 80. Following this\
    \ is the three-octet\n   field, values for which are allocated to network operators;\
    \ the\n   registration authority for this field is delegated to GSA (General\n\
    \   Services Administration).\n   The last octet of the NSAP is the NSelector\
    \ (NSel). In practice, the\n   NSAP minus the NSel identifies the CLNP protocol\
    \ machine on a given\n   system, and the NSel identifies the CLNP user. Since\
    \ there can be\n   more than one CLNP user (meaning multiple NSel values for a\
    \ given\n   \"base\" NSAP), the representation of the NSAP should be CLNP-user\n\
    \   independent. To achieve this, an NSel value of zero shall be used\n   with\
    \ all NSAP values stored in the DNS. An NSAP with NSel=0\n   identifies the network\
    \ layer itself. It is left to the application\n   retrieving the NSAP to determine\
    \ the appropriate value to use in that\n   instance of communication.\n      \

    \ 1: GOSIP Version 2 NSAP structure.\n   When CLNP is used to support TCP and\
    \ UDP services, the NSel value\n   used is the appropriate IP PROTO value as registered\
    \ with the IANA.\n   For \"standard\" OSI, the selection of NSel values is left\
    \ as a matter\n   of local administration. Administrators of systems that support\
    \ the\n   OSI transport protocol [5] in addition to TCP/UDP must select NSels\n\
    \   for use by OSI Transport that do not conflict with the IP PROTO\n   values.\n\
    \   In the NSAP RRs in Master Files and in the printed text in this memo,\n  \
    \ NSAPs are often represented as a string of \".\"-separated hex values.\n   The\
    \ values correspond to convenient divisions of the NSAP to make it\n   more readable.\
    \ For example, the \".\"-separated fields might correspond\n   to the NSAP fields\
    \ as defined by the appropriate authority (ISOC,\n   RARE, U.S. GOSIP, ANSI, etc.).\
    \ The use of this notation is strictly\n   for readability. The \".\"s do not\
    \ appear in DNS packets and DNS\n   servers can ignore them when reading Master\
    \ Files. For example, a\n   printable representation of the first four fields\
    \ of a U.S. GOSIP\n   NSAP might look like\n                             47.0005.80.005a00\n\
    \   and a full U.S. GOSIP NSAP might appear as\n             47.0005.80.005a00.0000.1000.0020.00800a123456.00.\n\
    \   Other NSAP formats have different lengths and different\n   administratively\
    \ defined field widths to accomodate different\n   requirements. For more information\
    \ on NSAP formats in use see RFC\n   1629 [2].\n"
