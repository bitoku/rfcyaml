  - "1.  Introduction\n   [DSTE-REQ] presents the Service Provider requirements for
    support of\n   Differentiated-Service (Diffserv)-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering\n
    \  (DS-TE).  This includes the fundamental requirement to be able to\n   enforce
    different bandwidth constraints for different classes of\n   traffic.\n   This
    document specifies the IGP and RSVP-TE signaling extensions\n   (beyond those
    already specified for existing MPLS Traffic Engineering\n   [OSPF-TE][ISIS-TE][RSVP-TE])
    for support of the DS-TE requirements\n   spelled out in [DSTE-REQ] including
    environments relying on\n   distributed Constraint-Based Routing (e.g., path computation\n
    \  involving head-end Label Switching Routers).\n   [DSTE-REQ] provides a definition
    and examples of Bandwidth\n   Constraints models.  The present document does not
    specify nor assume\n   a particular Bandwidth Constraints model.  Specific Bandwidth\n
    \  Constraints models are outside the scope of this document.  Although\n   the
    extensions for DS-TE specified in this document may not be\n   sufficient to support
    all the conceivable Bandwidth Constraints\n   models, they do support the Russian
    Dolls Model specified in\n   [DSTE-RDM], the Maximum Allocation Model specified
    in [DSTE-MAM], and\n   the Maximum Allocation with Reservation Model specified
    in\n   [DSTE-MAR].\n   There may be differences between the quality of service
    expressed and\n   obtained with Diffserv without DS-TE and with DS-TE.  Because
    DS-TE\n   uses Constraint-Based Routing, and because of the type of admission\n
    \  control capabilities it adds to Diffserv, DS-TE has capabilities for\n   traffic
    that Diffserv does not:  Diffserv does not indicate\n   preemption, by intent,
    whereas DS-TE describes multiple levels of\n   preemption for its Class-Types.
    \ Also, Diffserv does not support any\n   means of explicitly controlling overbooking,
    while DS-TE allows this.\n   When considering a complete quality of service environment,
    with\n   Diffserv routers and DS-TE, it is important to consider these\n   differences
    carefully.\n"

    are repeated\n   here:\n   Traffic Trunk:   an aggregation of traffic flows of
    the same class\n                    (i.e., treated equivalently from the DS-TE\n
    \                   perspective), which is placed inside a Label\n                    Switched
    Path (LSP).\n   Class-Type (CT): the set of Traffic Trunks crossing a link that
    is\n                    governed by a specific set of bandwidth constraints.\n
    \                   CT is used for the purposes of link bandwidth\n                    allocation,
    constraint-based routing and admission\n                    control.  A given
    Traffic Trunk belongs to the same\n                    CT on all links.\n   TE-Class:
    \       A pair of:\n                    i.  a Class-Type\n                    ii.
    a preemption priority allowed for that Class-\n                    Type.  This
    means that an LSP transporting a Traffic\n                    Trunk from that
    Class-Type can use that preemption\n                    priority as the setup
    priority, the holding\n                    priority, or both.\n   Definitions

        of the Bandwidth Constraints\n   Model, the DS-TE solution MUST allow support
        for up to 8 BCs.\"\n   For DS-TE, the existing \"Maximum Reservable link bandwidth\"
        parameter\n   is retained, but its semantics is generalized and interpreted
        as the\n   aggregate bandwidth constraint across all Class-Types, so that,\n
        \  independently of the Bandwidth Constraints Model in use:\n      SUM (Reserved
        (CTc)) <= Max Reservable Bandwidth,\n   where the SUM is across all values
        of \"c\" in the range 0 <= c <= 7.\n   Additionally, on every link, a DS-TE
        implementation MUST provide for\n   configuration of up to 8 additional link
        parameters which are the\n   eight potential BCs, i.e., BC0, BC1, ... BC7.
        \ The LSR MUST interpret\n   these BCs in accordance with the supported Bandwidth
        Constraints\n   Model (i.e., what BC applies to what Class-Type, and how).\n
        \  Where the Bandwidth Constraints Model imposes some relationship among\n
        \  the values to be configured for these BCs, the LSR MUST enforce those\n
        \  at configuration time.  For example, when the Russian Dolls Bandwidth\n
        \  Constraints Model ([DSTE-RDM]) is used, the LSR MUST ensure that BCi\n
        \  is configured smaller than or equal to BCj, where i is greater than\n   j,
        and ensure that BC0 is equal to the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth.\n   As another
        example, when the Maximum Allocation Model ([DSTE-MAM]) is\n   used, the LSR
        MUST ensure that all BCi are configured smaller or\n   equal to the Maximum
        Reservable Bandwidth.\n"

      - "4.1.2.  Overbooking\n   DS-TE enables a network administrator to apply different
        overbooking\n   (or underbooking) ratios for different CTs.\n   The principal
        methods to achieve this are the same as those\n   historically used in existing
        TE deployment:\n   (i)    To take into account the overbooking/underbooking
        ratio\n          appropriate for the Ordered Aggregate (OA) or CT associated\n
        \         with the considered LSP at the time of establishing the\n          bandwidth
        size of a given LSP.  We refer to this method as the\n          \"LSP Size
        Overbooking\" method.  AND/OR\n   (ii)   To take into account the overbooking/underbooking
        ratio at the\n          time of configuring the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth/BCs
        and\n          use values that are larger (overbooking) or smaller\n          (underbooking)
        than those actually supported by the link.  We\n          refer to this method
        as the \"Link Size Overbooking\" method.\n   The \"LSP Size Overbooking\"
        and \"Link Size Overbooking\" methods are\n   expected to be sufficient in
        many DS-TE environments and require no\n   additional configurable parameters.
        \ Other overbooking methods may\n   involve such additional configurable parameters,
        but are beyond the\n   scope of this document.\n"

      - "4.2.1.  TE-Class Mapping\n   In line with [DSTE-REQ], the preemption attributes
        defined in\n   [TE-REQ] are retained with DS-TE and applicable within, and
        across,\n   all CTs.  The preemption attributes of setup priority and holding\n
        \  priority retain existing semantics, and in particular these semantics\n
        \  are not affected by the LSP CT.  This means that if LSP1 contends\n   with
        LSP2 for resources, LSP1 may preempt LSP2 if LSP1 has a higher\n   setup preemption
        priority (i.e., lower numerical priority value) than\n   LSP2 holding preemption
        priority, regardless of LSP1 CT and LSP2 CT.\n   DS-TE LSRs MUST allow configuration
        of a TE-Class mapping whereby the\n   Class-Type and preemption level are
        configured for each of (up to) 8\n   TE-Classes.\n   This mapping is referred
        to as :\n      TE-Class[i]  <-->  < CTc , preemption p >\n   where 0 <= i
        <= 7, 0 <= c <= 7, 0 <= p <= 7\n   Two TE-Classes MUST NOT be identical (i.e.,
        have both the same\n   Class-Type and the same preemption priority).\n   There
        are no other restrictions on how any of the 8 Class-Types can\n   be paired
        up with any of the 8 preemption priorities to form a TE-\n   Class.  In particular,
        one given preemption priority can be paired up\n   with two (or more) different
        Class-Types to form two (or more) TE-\n   Classes.  Similarly, one Class-Type
        can be paired up with two (or\n   more) different preemption priorities to
        form two (or more) TE-\n   Classes.  Also, there is no mandatory ordering
        relationship between\n   the TE-Class index (i.e., \"i\" above) and the Class-Type
        (i.e., \"c\"\n   above) or the preemption priority (i.e., \"p\" above) of
        the TE-Class.\n   Where the network administrator uses less than 8 TE-Classes,
        the DS-\n   TE LSR MUST allow remaining ones to be configured as \"Unused\".
        \ Note\n   that configuring all the 8 TE-Classes as \"Unused\" effectively
        results\n   in disabling TE/DS-TE since no TE/DS-TE LSP can be established
        (nor\n   even configured, since as described in Section 4.3.3 below, the CT\n
        \  and preemption priorities configured for an LSP MUST form one of the\n
        \  configured TE-Classes).\n   To ensure coherent DS-TE operation, the network
        administrator MUST\n   configure exactly the same TE-Class mapping on all
        LSRs of the DS-TE\n   domain.\n   When the TE-Class mapping needs to be modified
        in the DS-TE domain,\n   care ought to be exercised during the transient period
        of\n   reconfiguration during which some DS-TE LSRs may be configured with\n
        \  the new TE-Class mapping while others are still configured with the\n   old
        TE-Class mapping.  It is recommended that active tunnels do not\n   use any
        of the TE-Classes that are being modified during such a\n   transient reconfiguration
        period.\n"

      BCs, MUST use the new \"Bandwidth\n   Constraints\" sub-TLV (in addition to
      the existing Maximum Reservable\n   Bandwidth sub-TLV) to do so.  For example,
      in the case where a\n   service provider deploys DS-TE with TE-Classes associated
      with CT0\n   and CT1 only, and where the Bandwidth Constraints Model is such
      that\n   only BC0 and BC1 are relevant to CT0 and CT1, a DS-TE LSR which does\n
      \  advertise BCs would include in the IGP advertisement the Maximum\n   Reservable
      Bandwidth sub-TLV, as well as the \"Bandwidth Constraints\"\n   sub-TLV.  The
      former should contain the aggregate bandwidth\n   constraint across all CTs,
      and the latter should contain BC0 and BC1.\n   A DS-TE LSR receiving the \"Bandwidth
      Constraints\" sub-TLV with a\n   Bandwidth Constraints Model Id that does not
      match the Bandwidth\n   Constraints Model it currently uses SHOULD generate
      a warning to the\n   operator/management system, reporting the inconsistency
      between\n   Bandwidth Constraints Models used on different links.  Also, in
      that\n   case, if the DS-TE LSR does not support the Bandwidth Constraints\n
      \  Model designated by the Bandwidth Constraints Model Id, or if the\n   DS-TE
      LSR does not support operations with multiple simultaneous\n   Bandwidth Constraints
      Models, the DS-TE LSR MAY discard the\n   corresponding TLV.  If the DS-TE LSR
      does support the Bandwidth\n   Constraints Model designated by the Bandwidth
      Constraints Model Id,\n   and if the DS-TE LSR does support operations with
      multiple\n   simultaneous Bandwidth Constraints Models, the DS-TE LSR MAY accept\n
      \  the corresponding TLV and allow operations with different Bandwidth\n   Constraints
      Models used in different parts of the DS-TE domain.\n"

    - "5.2.  Unreserved Bandwidth\n   With DS-TE, the existing \"Unreserved Bandwidth\"
      sub-TLV is retained\n   as the only vehicle to advertise dynamic bandwidth information\n
      \  necessary for Constraint-Based Routing on head-ends, except that it\n   is
      used with a generalized semantics.  The Unreserved Bandwidth sub-\n   TLV still
      carries eight bandwidth values, but they now correspond to\n   the unreserved
      bandwidth for each of the TE-Classes (instead of for\n   each preemption priority,
      as per existing TE).\n   More precisely, a DS-TE LSR MUST support the Unreserved
      Bandwidth\n   sub-TLV with a definition that is generalized into the following:\n
      \  The Unreserved Bandwidth sub-TLV specifies the amount of bandwidth\n   not
      yet reserved for each of the eight TE-Classes, in IEEE floating\n   point format
      arranged in increasing order of TE-Class index.\n   Unreserved bandwidth for
      TE-Class [0] occurs at the start of the\n   sub-TLV, and unreserved bandwidth
      for TE-Class [7] at the end of the\n   sub-TLV.  The unreserved bandwidth value
      for TE-Class [i] ( 0 <= i <=\n   7) is referred to as \"Unreserved TE-Class
      [i]\".  It indicates the\n   bandwidth that is available, for reservation, to
      an LSP that:\n   - transports a Traffic Trunk from the Class-Type of TE-Class[i],
      and\n   - has a setup priority corresponding to the preemption priority of\n
      \    TE-Class[i].\n   The units are bytes per second.\n   Because the bandwidth
      values are now ordered by TE-class index and\n   thus can relate to different
      CTs with different BCs and to any\n   arbitrary preemption priority, a DS-TE
      LSR MUST NOT assume any\n   ordered relationship among these bandwidth values.\n
      \  With existing TE, because all preemption priorities reflect the same\n   (and
      only) BCs and bandwidth values are advertised in preemption\n   priority order,
      the following relationship is always true, and is\n   often assumed by TE implementations:\n
      \     If i < j, then \"Unreserved Bw [i]\" >= \"Unreserved Bw [j]\"\n   With
      DS-TE, no relationship is to be assumed such that:\n      If i < j, then any
      of the following relationships may be true:\n                \"Unreserved TE-Class
      [i]\" = \"Unreserved TE-Class [j]\"\n                    OR\n                \"Unreserved
      TE-Class [i]\" > \"Unreserved TE-Class [j]\"\n                    OR\n                \"Unreserved
      TE-Class [i]\" < \"Unreserved TE-Class [j]\".\n   Rules for computing \"Unreserved
      TE-Class [i]\" are specified in\n   Section 11.\n   If TE-Class[i] is unused,
      the value advertised by the IGP in\n   \"Unreserved TE-Class [i]\" MUST be set
      to zero by the LSR generating\n   the IGP advertisement, and MUST be ignored
      by the LSR receiving the\n   IGP advertisement.\n"

    - "11.1.  Computing \"Unreserved TE-Class [i]\"\n   We first observe that, for
      existing TE, details on admission control\n   algorithms for TE LSPs, and consequently
      details on formulas for\n   computing the unreserved bandwidth, are outside
      the scope of the\n   current IETF work.  This is left for vendor differentiation.
      \ Note\n   that this does not compromise interoperability across various\n   implementations
      because the TE schemes rely on LSRs to advertise\n   their local view of the
      world in terms of Unreserved Bw to other\n   LSRs.  This way, regardless of
      the actual local admission control\n   algorithm used on one given LSR, Constraint-Based
      Routing on other\n   LSRs can rely on advertised information to determine whether
      an\n   additional LSP will be accepted or rejected by the given LSR.  The\n
      \  only requirement is that an LSR advertises unreserved bandwidth\n   values
      that are consistent with its specific local admission control\n   algorithm
      and take into account the holding preemption priority of\n   established LSPs.\n
      \  In the context of DS-TE, again, details on admission control\n   algorithms
      are left for vendor differentiation, and formulas for\n   computing the unreserved
      bandwidth for TE-Class[i] are outside the\n   scope of this specification.  However,
      DS-TE places the additional\n   requirement on the LSR that the unreserved bandwidth
      values\n   advertised MUST reflect all the BCs relevant to the CT associated\n
      \  with TE-Class[i] in accordance with the Bandwidth Constraints Model.\n   Thus,
      formulas for computing \"Unreserved TE-Class [i]\" depend on the\n   Bandwidth
      Constraints Model in use and MUST reflect how BCs apply to\n   CTs.  Example
      formulas for computing \"Unreserved TE-Class [i]\" Model\n   are provided for
      the Russian Dolls Model and Maximum Allocation Model\n   respectively in [DSTE-RDM]
      and [DSTE-MAM].\n   As with existing TE, DS-TE LSRs MUST consider the holding
      preemption\n   priority of established LSPs (as opposed to their setup preemption\n
      \  priority) for the purpose of computing the unreserved bandwidth for\n   TE-Class

  - "Appendix A: Prediction for Multiple Path Computation\n   There are situations
    where a head-end needs to compute paths for\n   multiple LSPs over a short period
    of time.  There are potential\n   advantages for the head-end in trying to predict
    the impact of the\n   n-th LSP on the unreserved bandwidth when computing the
    path for the\n   (n+1)-th LSP, before receiving updated IGP information.  For
    example,\n   better load-distribution of the multiple LSPs would be performed\n
    \  across multiple paths.  Also, when the (n+1)-th LSP would no longer\n   fit
    on a link after establishment of the n-th LSP, the head-end would\n   avoid Connection
    Admission Control (CAC) rejection.  Although there\n   are a number of conceivable
    scenarios where worse situations might\n   result, doing such predictions is more
    likely to improve situations.\n   As a matter of fact, a number of network administrators
    have elected\n   to use such predictions when deploying existing TE.\n   Such
    predictions are local matters, are optional, and are outside the\n   scope of
    this specification.\n   Where such predictions are not used, the optional BC sub-TLV
    and the\n   optional Maximum Reservable Bandwidth sub-TLV need not be advertised\n
    \  in IGP for the purpose of path computation, since the information\n   contained
    in the Unreserved Bw sub-TLV is all that is required by\n   Head-Ends to perform
    Constraint-Based Routing.\n   Where such predictions are used on head-ends, the
    optional BCs sub-\n   TLV and the optional Maximum Reservable Bandwidth sub-TLV
    MAY be\n   advertised in IGP.  This is in order for the head-ends to predict as\n
    \  accurately as possible how an LSP affects unreserved bandwidth values\n   for
    subsequent LSPs.\n   Remembering that actual admission control algorithms are
    left for\n   vendor differentiation, we observe that predictions can only be\n
    \  performed effectively when the head-end LSR predictions are based on\n   the
    same (or a very close) admission control algorithm as that used\n   by other LSRs.\n"

      the scenarios presented in\n   [DSTE-REQ].\n   It also satisfies all the detailed
      requirements presented in\n   [DSTE-REQ].\n   The objective set out in the last
      paragraph of Section 4.7 of\n   [DSTE-REQ], \"Overbooking\", is only partially
      addressed by this DS-TE\n   solution.  Through support of the \"LSP size Overbooking\"
      and \"Link\n   Size Overbooking\" methods, this DS-TE solution effectively allows
      CTs\n   to have different overbooking ratios and simultaneously allows\n   overbooking
      to be tweaked differently (collectively across all CTs)\n   on different links.
      \ But, in a general sense, it does not allow the\n   effective overbooking ratio
      of every CT to be tweaked differently in\n   different parts of the network
      independently of other CTs, while\n   maintaining accurate bandwidth accounting
      of how different CTs\n   mutually affect each other through shared BCs (such

      scalability\n   impact compared to that of existing TE.\n   From an IGP viewpoint,
      the amount of mandatory information to be\n   advertised is identical to that
      of existing TE.  One additional sub-\n   TLV has been specified, but its use
      is optional, and it only contains\n   a limited amount of static information
      (at most 8 BCs).\n   We expect no noticeable impact on LSP Path computation
      because, as\n   with existing TE, this solution only requires Constrained Shortest\n
      \  Path First (CSPF) to consider a single unreserved bandwidth value for\n   any
      given LSP.\n   From a signaling viewpoint, we expect no significant impact due
      to\n   this solution because it only requires processing of one additional\n
      \  item of information (the Class-Type) and does not significantly\n   increase
      the likelihood of CAC rejection.  Note that DS-TE has some\n   inherent impact
      on LSP signaling in that it assumes that different\n   classes of traffic are
      split over different LSPs so that more LSPs\n   need to be signaled.  However,
      this is due to the DS-TE concept\n   itself and not to the actual DS-TE solution
      discussed here.\n"

      an \"upgraded\" LSR\n   with a DS-TE implementation can directly interwork with
      an \"old\" LSR\n   supporting existing TE only.\n   This solution is expected
      to allow smooth migration when the number\n   of CTs actually deployed is increased,

  - "Appendix C: Interoperability with Non-DS-TE Capable LSRs\n   This DSTE solution
    allows operations in a hybrid network where some\n   LSRs are DS-TE capable and
    some are not, as may occur during\n   migration phases.  This appendix discusses
    the constraints and\n   operations in such hybrid networks.\n   We refer to the
    set of DS-TE-capable LSRs as the DS-TE domain.  We\n   refer to the set of non-DS-TE-capable
    (but TE-capable) LSRs as the\n   TE-domain.\n   Hybrid operations require that
    the TE-Class mapping in the DS-TE\n   domain be configured so that:\n         -
    a TE-Class exists for CT0 for every preemption priority\n           actually used
    in the TE domain, and\n         - the index in the TE-class mapping for each of
    these TE-\n           Classes is equal to the preemption priority.\n   For example,
    imagine the TE domain uses preemption 2 and 3.  Then,\n   DS-TE can be deployed
    in the same network by including the following\n   TE-Classes in the TE-Class
    mapping:\n           i   <--->       CT      preemption\n         ====================================\n
    \          2               CT0     2\n           3               CT0     3\n   Another
    way to look at this is to say that although the whole TE-\n   class mapping does
    not have to be consistent with the TE domain, the\n   subset of this TE-Class
    mapping applicable to CT0 effectively has to\n   be consistent with the TE domain.\n
    \  Hybrid operations also require that:\n         - non-DS-TE-capable LSRs be
    configured to advertise the Maximum\n           Reservable Bandwidth, and\n         -
    DS-TE-capable LSRs be configured to advertise BCs (using the\n           Max Reservable
    Bandwidth sub-TLV as well as the BCs sub-TLV,\n           as specified in Section
    5.1).\n   This allows DS-TE-capable LSRs to identify non-DS-TE-capable LSRs\n
    \  unambiguously.\n   Finally, hybrid operations require that non-DS-TE-capable
    LSRs be\n   able to accept Unreserved Bw sub-TLVs containing non decreasing\n
    \  bandwidth values (i.e., with Unreserved [p] < Unreserved [q] with p <\n   q).\n
    \  In such hybrid networks, the following apply:\n         - CT0 LSPs can be established
    by both DS-TE-capable LSRs and\n           non-DS-TE-capable LSRs.\n         -
    CT0 LSPs can transit via (or terminate at) both DS-TE-capable\n           LSRs
    and non-DS-TE-capable LSRs.\n         - LSPs from other CTs can only be established
    by DS-TE-capable\n           LSRs.\n         - LSPs from other CTs can only transit
    via (or terminate at)\n           DS-TE-capable LSRs.\n   Let us consider the
    following example to illustrate operations:\n      LSR0--------LSR1----------LSR2\n
    \          Link01       Link12\n      where:\n         LSR0 is a non-DS-TE-capable
    LSR\n         LSR1 and LSR2 are DS-TE-capable LSRs\n   Let's assume again that
    preemptions 2 and 3 are used in the TE-domain\n   and that the following TE-Class
    mapping is configured on LSR1 and\n   LSR2:\n           i   <--->       CT      preemption\n
    \        ====================================\n           0               CT1
    \    0\n           1               CT1     1\n           2               CT0     2\n
    \          3               CT0     3\n           rest            unused\n   LSR0
    is configured with a Max Reservable Bandwidth = m01 for Link01.\n   LSR1 is configured
    with a BC0 = x0, a BC1 = x1 (possibly = 0), and a\n   Max Reservable Bandwidth
    = m10 (possibly = m01) for Link01.\n   In IGP for Link01, LSR0 will advertise:\n
    \        - Max Reservable Bw sub-TLV = <m01>\n         - Unreserved Bw sub-TLV
    = <CT0/0, CT0/1, CT0/2, CT0/3, CT0/4,\n           CT0/5, CT0/6, CT0/7>\n   On
    receipt of such advertisement, LSR1 will:\n         - understand that LSR0 is
    not DS-TE-capable because it\n           advertised a Max Reservable Bw sub-TLV
    and no Bandwidth\n           Constraints sub-TLV, and\n         - conclude that
    only CT0 LSPs can transit via LSR0 and that\n           only the values CT0/2
    and CT0/3 are meaningful in the\n           Unreserved Bw sub-TLV.  LSR1 may effectively
    behave as if the\n           six other values contained in the Unreserved Bw sub-TLV
    were\n           set to zero.\n   In IGP for Link01, LSR1 will advertise:\n         -
    Max Reservable Bw sub-TLV = <m10>\n         - Bandwidth Constraints sub-TLV =
    <BC Model ID, x0, x1>\n         - Unreserved Bw sub-TLV =\n           <CT1/0,
    CT1/1, CT0/2, CT0/3, 0, 0, 0, 0>\n   On receipt of such advertisement, LSR0 will:\n
    \        - ignore the Bandwidth Constraints sub-TLV (unrecognized)\n         -
    correctly process CT0/2 and CT0/3 in the Unreserved Bw sub-\n           TLV and
    use these values for CTO LSP establishment\n         - incorrectly believe that
    the other values contained in the\n           Unreserved Bw sub-TLV relate to
    other preemption priorities\n           for CT0; but it will actually never use
    those since we assume\n           that only preemptions 2 and 3 are used in the
    TE domain.\n"
