- title: 1. IPng Requirements
  contents:
  - "1. IPng Requirements\n   The following list provides requirements on the IPng\
    \ from the\n   perspective of the Unified Routing Architecture, as describe in\
    \ RFC\n   1322.\n   1. To provide scalable routing, IPng addressing must provide\
    \ support\n      for topologically significant address assignment.\n   2. Since\
    \ it is hard to predict how routing information will be\n      aggregated, the\
    \ IPng addressing structure should impose as few\n      preconditions as possible\
    \ on the number of levels in the hierarchy.\n      Specifically, the number of\
    \ levels must be allowed to be different\n      at different parts in the hierarchy.\
    \ Further, the levels must not\n      be statically tied to particular parts (fields)\
    \ in the addressing\n      information.\n   3. Hop-by-hop forwarding algorithm\
    \ requires IPng to carry enough\n      information in the Network Layer header\
    \ to unambiguously determine\n      a particular next hop. Unless mechanisms to\
    \ compute\n      context-sensitive forwarding tables and provide consistent\n\
    \      forwarding are defined, the requirement assumes the presence of\n     \
    \ full hierarchical addresses.  Therefore, IPng packet format must\n      provide\
    \ efficient determination of the full hierarchical\n      destination address.\n\
    \   4. Hierarchical address assignment should not imply strictly\n      hierarchical\
    \ routing. Therefore, IPng should carry enough\n      information to provide forwarding\
    \ along both hierarchical and\n      non-hierarchical routes.\n   5. The IPng\
    \ packet header should accommodate a \"routing label\" or\n      \"route ID\"\
    . This label will be used to identify a particular FIB\n      to be used for packet\
    \ forwarding by each router.\n      Two types of routing labels should be supported:\
    \ \"strong\" and\n      \"weak\".\n      When a packet carries a \"strong\" routing\
    \ label and a router does\n      not have a FIB with this label, the packet is\
    \ discarded (and an\n      error message is sent back to the source).\n      When\
    \ a packet carries a \"weak\" routing label and a router does not\n      have\
    \ a FIB with this label, the packet should be forwarded via a\n      \"default\"\
    \ FIB, i.e., according to the destination address. In\n      addition, the packet\
    \ should carry an indication that somewhere\n      along the path the desired\
    \ routing label was unavailable.\n   6. IPng should provide a source routing mechanism\
    \ with the following\n      capabilities (i.e., flexibility):\n       - Specification\
    \ of either individual routers or collections of\n         routers as the entities\
    \ in the source route.\n       - The option to indicate that two consecutive entities\
    \ in a\n         source route must share a common subnet in order for the\n  \
    \       source route to be valid.\n       - Specification of the default behavior\
    \ when the route to\n         the next entry in the source route is unavailable:\n\
    \       - The packet is discarded, or\n       - The source route is ignored and\
    \ the packet is forwarded based\n         only on the destination address (and\
    \ the packet header will\n         indicate this action).\n       - A mechanism\
    \ to verify the feasibility of a source route.\n"
