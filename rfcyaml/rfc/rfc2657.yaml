- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   LDAPv2 clients as implemented according to RFC 1777 [1] have no\n\
    \   notion on referral.  The integration between such a client and an\n   Index\
    \ Mesh, as defined by the Common Indexing Protocol [2], heavily\n   depends on\
    \ referrals and therefore needs to be handled in a special\n   way.  This document\
    \ defines one possible way of doing this.\n"
- title: 1. Background
  contents:
  - "1. Background\n   During the development of the Common Indexing Protocol (CIP),\
    \ one of\n   the underlying assumptions was that the interaction between clients\n\
    \   and the Index Mesh Servers [1] would heavily depend on the passing of\n  \
    \ referrals.  Protocols like LDAPv2 [2] that lack this functionality\n   need\
    \ to compensate for it by some means.  The way chosen in this memo\n   is to add\
    \ more intelligence into the client. There are two reasons\n   behind this decision.\
    \  First, this is not a major enhancement that is\n   needed and secondly, that\
    \ the intelligence when dealing with the\n   Index Mesh, with or the knowledge\
    \ about referrals, eventually has to\n   go into the client.\n"
- title: 2. The clients view of the Index Mesh
  contents:
  - "2. The clients view of the Index Mesh\n   If a LDAPv2 client is going to be able\
    \ to interact with the Index\n   Mesh, the Mesh has to appear as something that\
    \ is understandable to\n   the client.  Basically, this consists of representing\
    \ the index\n   servers and their contained indexes in a defined directory\n \
    \  information tree (DIT) [3,4] structure and a set of object classes\n   and\
    \ attribute types that have been proven to be useful in this\n   context.\n"

- title: 3. The interaction between a client and the Index Mesh
  contents:
  - "3. The interaction between a client and the Index Mesh\n   A client interaction\
    \ with the Index Mesh consists of a couple of\n   rather well defined actions.\
    \ The first being to find a suitable index\n   to start with, then to transverse\
    \ the Index Mesh and finally to query\n   the servers holding the original data.\
    \  Note when reading this text\n   that what is discussed here is the client's\
    \ perception of the DIT,\n   how it is in fact implemented is not discussed.\n"
- title: 3.1 Finding a Index Mesh
  contents:
  - "3.1 Finding a Index Mesh\n   This approach depends on the fact that every index\
    \ server partaking\n   in an Index Mesh is represented in the DIT by a entry of\
    \ the type\n   cIPDataSet, and has a distinguished name (DN) which most significant\n\
    \   relative distinguished name (RDN) has the attributetype dSI.\n   Therefore,\
    \ finding a suitable indexserver to start the search from is\n   a matter of searching\
    \ the DIT at a suitable place for objects with\n   the objectClass cIPIndexObject.\
    \  Every found entry can then be\n   evaluated by looking at the description value\
    \ as well as the\n   indexOCAT value. The description string should be a human\
    \ readable\n   and understandable text that describes what the index server is\n\
    \   indexing. An example of such a string could be, \"This index covers\n   all\
    \ employees at Swedish Universities and University Colleges that\n   has an email\
    \ account\". The indexOCAT attribute supplies information\n   about which kind\
    \ of entries and which attributes within these entries\n   that the index information\
    \ has emanated from.  For example, if the\n   indexOCAT attribute value is \"\
    person cn\", one can deduce that this is\n   an index over persons and not over\
    \ roles, and that it is the\n   attribute commonName that is indexed.\n"
- title: 3.2 Searching the mesh
  contents:
  - "3.2 Searching the mesh\n   Each index server has its information represented\
    \ in the DIT as a\n   very flat tree. In fact, it is only one level deep.\n  \

    \n                        0       0\n      cIPDataSet entries     cIPIndex entries\n\
    \      one for each DataSet   one for each index value\n      that this server\
    \ has   that this indexserver\n      gathered indexes from. has.\n   A search\
    \ then consists of a set of searches.  The first being the\n   search for the\
    \ index entries that contains an indexvalue that matches\n   what the user is\
    \ looking for, and the second a search based on the\n   DSI information in the\
    \ extendedDSI attribute values returned from the\n   first search.  In the case\
    \ of the the cIPIndexType being tagged-\n   index, the taglists should be compared\
    \ to find which DSI it might be\n   useful to pose further queries to.\n   When\
    \ doing these types of searches, the client should be aware of the\n   fact that\
    \ the index values disregarding their origin (attributeTypes)\n   always are stored\
    \ in the index server as values of the idx attribute.\n   The object of the second\
    \ search is to get information on the\n   different DataSet involved, and should\
    \ normally be performed as a\n   read. Since the DataSet information probably\
    \ will remain quite stable\n   over time, this information lends itself very well\
    \ to caching.  If at\n   this stage there is more than one DataSet involved, the\
    \ User\n   interface might use the description value to aid the user in choosing\n\
    \   which one to proceed with.  The content of the searchBase value of\n   the\
    \ DataSet tells the client whether it represents another index\n   server (the\
    \ most significant part of the dn is a dSI attribute) or if\n   it is a end server.\n"
- title: 3.3 Querying the end server
  contents:
  - "3.3 Querying the end server\n   When finally reaching the end server/servers\
    \ that probably has the\n   sought for information, the information in the indexOCAT\
    \ attribute\n   can be used to produce an appropriate filter.  If a search for\
    \ \"Rol*\"\n   in an index having an indexOCAT attribute value of \"person cn\"\
    \n   returns an idx entry with the idx value of \"Roland\", then an\n   appropriate\
    \ filter to use might be \"&(|(cn=* roland *)(cn=roland\n   *)(cn=* roland))(objectclass=person)\"\
    .  A complete example of a\n   search process is given in Appendix A.\n"

    dsi=1.2.752.17.5.0,c=SE\"\n   and the filter \"(|(idx=roland)(idx=hedberg))\"\
    \ was issued.\n   The following results were received:\n   DN: idx=Roland,dSI=1.2.752.17.5.0,c=SE\n\

    \   A comparison between the two sets of extendedDSIs shows that two\n   datasets\

    \ \"Hedberg\". Therefore, the next step would be to see what\n   the datasets\
    \ represent.  A comparison like this should normally not\n   be left to the user.\n\
    \   Step. 3\n   Two baselevel searches, one for\n   \"dsi=1.2.752.17.5.10,dsi=1.2.752.17.5.0,c=SE\"\

    \ descriptions for the two datasets, \"1.2.752.17.5.10\" was\n   chosen as the\
    \ best to proceed with.  From the searchbase attribute\n   value, it was clear\
