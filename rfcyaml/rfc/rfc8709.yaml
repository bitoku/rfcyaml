  - "1.  Introduction\n   Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] is a secure remote-login protocol.
    \ It\n   provides for an extensible variety of public key algorithms for\n   identifying
    servers and users to one another.  Ed25519 [RFC8032] is a\n   digital signature
    system.  OpenSSH 6.5 [OpenSSH-6.5] introduced\n   support for using Ed25519 for
    server and user authentication and was\n   then followed by other SSH implementations.\n
    \  This document describes the method implemented by OpenSSH and others\n   and
    formalizes the use of the name \"ssh-ed25519\".  Additionally, this\n   document
    describes the use of Ed448 and formalizes the use of the\n   name \"ssh-ed448\".\n"

  - "3.  Public Key Algorithm\n   This document describes a public key algorithm for
    use with SSH, as\n   per [RFC4253], Section 6.6.  The name of the algorithm is
    \"ssh-\n   ed25519\".  This algorithm only supports signing and not encryption.\n
    \  Additionally, this document describes another public key algorithm.\n   The
    name of the algorithm is \"ssh-ed448\".  This algorithm only\n   supports signing
    and not encryption.\n   Standard implementations of SSH SHOULD implement these
    signature\n   algorithms.\n"

  - "8.  SSHFP DNS Resource Records\n   Usage and generation of the SSHFP DNS resource
    record is described in\n   [RFC4255].  The generation of SSHFP resource records
    for \"ssh-\n   ed25519\" keys is described in [RFC7479].  This section illustrates\n
    \  the generation of SSHFP resource records for \"ssh-ed448\" keys, and\n   this
    document also specifies the corresponding Ed448 code point to\n   \"SSHFP RR Types
    for public key algorithms\" in the \"DNS SSHFP Resource\n   Record Parameters\"
    IANA registry [IANA-SSHFP].\n   The generation of SSHFP resource records for \"ssh-ed448\"
    keys is\n   described as follows.\n   The encoding of Ed448 public keys is described
    in [ED448].  In brief,\n   an Ed448 public key is a 57-octet value representing
    a 455-bit\n   y-coordinate of an elliptic curve point, and a sign bit indicating\n
    \  the corresponding x-coordinate.\n   The SSHFP Resource Record for the Ed448
    public key with SHA-256\n   fingerprint would, for example, be:\n   example.com.
    IN SSHFP 6 2 ( a87f1b687ac0e57d2a081a2f2826723\n                               34d90ed316d2b818ca9580ea384d924\n
