  - "1.  Introduction\n   The growth in large-scale Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)\n\
    \   deployments has brought into focus a number of technical challenges.\n   Among\
    \ them is the complexity of managing large numbers of Wireless\n   Termination\
    \ Points (WTPs), which is further exacerbated by variations\n   in their design.\
    \  Another challenge is the maintenance of consistent\n   configurations among\
    \ the numerous WTPs of a system.  The dynamic\n   nature of the wireless medium\
    \ is also a concern together with WLAN\n   security.  The challenges affecting\
    \ large-scale WLAN deployments have\n   been highlighted in [RFC3990].\n   Many\
    \ vendors have addressed these challenges by developing new\n   architectures\
    \ and solutions.  A survey of the various developments\n   was conducted to better\
    \ understand the context of these challenges.\n   This survey is a first step\
    \ towards designing interoperability among\n   the solutions.  The Architecture\
    \ Taxonomy [RFC4118] is a result of\n   this survey in which major WLAN architecture\
    \ families are classified.\n   Broadly, these are the autonomous, centralized\
    \ WLAN, and distributed\n   mesh architectures.\n   The Architecture Taxonomy\
    \ identified the centralized WLAN\n   architecture as one in which portions of\
    \ the wireless medium access\n   control (MAC) operations are centralized in a\
    \ WLAN controller.  This\n   centralized WLAN architecture is further classified\
    \ into remote-MAC,\n   split-MAC, and local-MAC designs.  Each differs in the\
    \ degree of\n   separation of wireless MAC layer capabilities between WTPs and\
    \ WLAN\n   controller.\n   This document puts forward critical objectives for\
    \ achieving\n   interoperability in the CAPWAP framework.  It presents requirements\n\
    \   that address the challenges of controlling and provisioning large-\n   scale\
    \ WLAN deployments.  The realization of these objectives in a\n   CAPWAP protocol\
    \ will ensure that WLAN equipment of major design types\n   may be integrally\
    \ deployed and managed.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This document uses terminology defined in [RFC4118], [802.11],\n\
    \   [802.11i], and [802.11e].  Additionally, the following terms are\n   defined.\n\
    \   Centralized WLAN: A WLAN based on the centralized WLAN Architecture\n   [RFC4118].\n\
    \   Switching Segment: Those aspects of a centralized WLAN that primarily\n  \
    \ deal with switching or routing of control and data information\n   between Wireless\
    \ Termination Points (WTPs) and the WLAN controller.\n   Wireless Medium Segment:\
    \ Those aspects of a centralized WLAN that\n   primarily deal with the wireless\
    \ interface between WTPs and wireless\n   terminals.  The Wireless Medium Segment\
    \ is specific to layer 2\n   wireless technology, such as IEEE 802.11.\n   CAPWAP\
    \ Framework: A term that covers the local-MAC and split-MAC\n   designs of the\
    \ Centralized WLAN Architecture.  Standardization\n   efforts are focused on these\
    \ designs.\n   CAPWAP Protocol: The protocol between WLAN controller and WTPs\
    \ in the\n   CAPWAP framework.  It facilitates control, management, and\n   provisioning\
    \ of WTPs in an interoperable manner.\n   Logical Group: A logical separation\
    \ of a physical WTP is termed\n   logical group.  So a single physical WTP will\
    \ operate a number of\n   logical groups.  Virtual access points (APs) are examples\
    \ of logical\n   groups.  Here, each Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) and\n\
    \   constituent wireless terminals' radios are denoted as distinct\n   logical\
    \ groups of a physical WTP.  Logical groups are maintained\n   without conflicting\
    \ with the CAPWAP objectives, particularly the\n   'Wireless Terminal Transparency'\
    \ objective.\n"

  - "4.  Objectives Overview\n   The objectives for CAPWAP have been broadly classified\
    \ to address\n   architecture, operation, and security requirements of managing\n\
    \   large-scale WLAN deployments.\n   Architecture objectives deal with system-level\
    \ aspects of the CAPWAP\n   protocol.  They address issues of protocol extensibility,\
    \ diversity\n   in network deployments and architecture designs, and differences\
    \ in\n   transport technologies.\n   Operational objectives address the control\
    \ and management features of\n   the CAPWAP protocol.  They deal with operations\
    \ relating to WLAN\n   monitoring, resource management, Quality of Service (QoS),\
    \ and access\n   control.\n   Security objectives address potential threats to\
    \ WLANs and their\n   containment.  In the CAPWAP context, security requirements\
    \ cover the\n   protocol between the WLAN controller and WTPs and also the WLAN\n\
    \   system as a whole.\n   Additionally, a general classification is used for\

- title: 5.1.1.  Logical Groups
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Logical Groups\n   Classification: Architecture\n   Description:\n  \
    \ Large WLAN deployments are complex and expensive.  Furthermore,\n   enterprises\
    \ deploying such networks are under pressure to improve the\n   efficiency of\
    \ their expenditures.\n   Shared WLAN deployments, where a single physical WLAN\
    \ infrastructure\n   supports a number of logical networks, are increasingly used\
    \ to\n   address these two issues of large-scale WLANs.  These are popular as\n\
    \   they allow deployment and management costs to be spread across\n   businesses.\n\
    \   In traditional WLANs, each physical WTP represents one complete\n   subset\
    \ of a larger WLAN system.  Shared WLANs differ in that each\n   physical WTP\
    \ represents a number of logical subsets of possibly a\n   number of larger WLAN\
    \ systems.  Each logical division of a physical\n   WTP is referred to as a logical\
    \ group (see definition in Section 2).\n   So WLANs are managed in terms of logical\
    \ groups instead of physical\n   WTPs.  Logical groups are based on BSSIDs and\
    \ other types of virtual\n   APs.\n   Protocol Requirement:\n   The CAPWAP protocol\
    \ MUST be capable of controlling and managing\n   physical WTPs in terms of logical\
    \ groups including BSSID-based\n   groups.\n   For all operating modes, including\
    \ those in which the WTP performs\n   local bridging and those in which the Access\
    \ Controller (AC) performs\n   centralized bridging, the protocol MUST provide\
    \ provisions for\n   configuring logical groups at the WTP.\n   Motivation and\
    \ Protocol Benefits:\n   Commercial realities necessitate that WLANs be manageable\
    \ in terms of\n   their logical groups.  This allows separation of logical services\
    \ and\n   underlying infrastructure management.  A protocol that realizes this\n\
    \   need ensures simpler and cost-effective WLANs, which directly address\n  \
    \ the requirements of network service operators.\n   Relation to Problem Statement:\n\
    \   This objective addresses the problem of management complexity in\n   terms\
    \ of costs.  Cost complexity is reduced by sharing WLAN\n   deployments.  Consequently,\
    \ deployment and management cost-\n   efficiencies are realized.\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  Support for Traffic Separation
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Support for Traffic Separation\n   Classification: Operations\n   Description:\n\
    \   The centralized WLAN architecture simplifies complexity associated\n   with\
    \ large-scale deployments by consolidating portions of wireless\n   MAC functionality\
    \ at a central WLAN controller and distributing the\n   remaining across WTPs.\
    \  As a result, WTPs and WLAN controller\n   exchange control and data information\
    \ between them.  This objective\n   states that control and data aspects of the\
    \ exchanges be mutually\n   separated for further simplicity.  This will allow\
    \ solutions for each\n   type of exchange to be independently optimized.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ in the context of shared WLAN deployments, the mutual\n   separation of control\
    \ and data also addresses security concerns.  In\n   particular, given the likelihood\
    \ of different logical groups, such as\n   those established by different virtual\
    \ APs, being managed by\n   different administrators, separation of control and\
    \ data is a first\n   step towards individually containing and securing the logical\
    \ groups.\n   It is also important to ensure that traffic from each logical group\n\
    \   is mutually separated to maintain the integrity and independence of\n   the\
    \ logical groups.\n   Protocol Requirement:\n   The CAPWAP protocol MUST define\
    \ transport control messages such that\n   the transport of control messages is\
    \ separate from the transport of\n   data messages.\n   Motivation and Protocol\
    \ Benefits:\n   The aim of separating data and control aspects of the protocol\
    \ is to\n   simplify the protocol.  It also allows for the flexibility of\n  \
    \ addressing each type of traffic in the most appropriate manner.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ this requirement will help remotely located WTPs to\n   handle data traffic\
    \ in alternative ways without the need for\n   forwarding them across a wide network\
    \ to the WLAN controller.\n   Separation of WTP control and data also aids in\
    \ the secure\n   realization of shared WLAN deployments.\n   Relation to Problem\
    \ Statement:\n   Broadly, this objective relates to the challenge of managing\n\
    \   complexity in large-scale WLANs.  The requirement for traffic\n   separation\
    \ simplifies control as this is separated from the task of\n   data transport.\n"

  - "5.1.3.  Wireless Terminal Transparency\n   Classification: Operations\n   Description:\n\
    \   The CAPWAP protocol is applicable between a centralized WLAN\n   controller\
    \ and a number of WTPs; i.e., it affects only the switching\n   segment of the\
    \ centralized WLAN architecture.  Its operations should\n   therefore be independent\
    \ of the wireless terminal.  Wireless\n   terminals should not be required to\
    \ be aware of the existence of the\n   CAPWAP protocol.\n   Protocol Requirement:\n\
    \   Wireless terminals MUST NOT be required to recognize or be aware of\n   the\
    \ CAPWAP protocol.\n   Motivation and Protocol Benefits:\n   IEEE 802.11-based\
    \ wireless terminals are mature and widely available.\n   It would be beneficial\
    \ for CAPWAP not to impose new requirements on\n   these wireless terminals. \
    \ In effect, this requirement ensures that\n   the setup cost of the protocol\
    \ is reduced as the numerous existing\n   wireless terminals need not be altered.\n\
    \   Relation to Problem Statement:\n   The Problem Statement highlights the challenges\
    \ faced by large WLANs\n   consisting of many WTPs.  It does not refer to the\
    \ operations of\n   wireless terminals and this objective emphasizes the independence.\n"
- title: 5.1.4.  Configuration Consistency
  contents:
  - "5.1.4.  Configuration Consistency\n   Classification: Operations\n   Description:\n\
    \   WLANs in the CAPWAP framework contain numerous WTPs, each of them\n   needing\
    \ to be configured and managed in a consistent manner.  The\n   main concern in\
    \ ensuring consistency is availability of appropriate\n   information corresponding\
    \ to WTP configuration states.  So\n   configuration consistency can be achieved\
    \ by providing the\n   centralized WLAN controller with regular updates on the\
    \ state of WTP\n   operations.  The centralized WLAN controller can in turn apply\n\
    \   information from the regular updates to ensure consistently among the\n  \
    \ WTPs.\n   Protocol Requirement:\n   The CAPWAP protocol MUST include support\
    \ for regular exchanges of\n   state information between WTPs and the WLAN controller.\
    \  Examples of\n   state information include WTP processing load and memory utilization.\n\
    \   Motivation and Protocol Benefits:\n   A protocol that provides access to regular\
    \ state information can in\n   turn be used to enhance WLAN configuration and\
    \ performance.  The\n   CAPWAP protocol will be better equipped to address configuration-\n\
    \   related problems with the regularly available state information.  So\n   with\
    \ greater state information, control and management operations can\n   be improved.\n\
    \   Relation to Problem Statement:\n   One of the major challenges described in\

    \ of a switching segment\n   and wireless medium segment.  In the switching segment,\
    \ network\n   congestion, WTP status, and firmware information have to be\n  \
    \ monitored.  In the wireless medium segment, the dynamic nature of the\n   medium\

    \ the resulting information to the\n   relevant WLAN devices -- either WTPs or\
    \ the WLAN controller.\n   Moreover, given the relationship among information\

    \  For\n   example, statistics information and status signals from WTPs may be\n\

  - "5.1.7.  Resource Control Objective\n   Classification: Operations\n   Description:\n\
    \   Integral to the success of any wireless network system is the\n   performance\
    \ and quality it can offer its subscribers.  Since CAPWAP-\n   based WLANs combine\
    \ a switching segment and a wireless medium\n   segment, performance and quality\
    \ need to be coordinated across both\n   of these segments.  So QoS performance\
    \ must be enforced system-wide.\n   This objective highlights QoS over the entire\
    \ WLAN system, which\n   includes the switching segment and the wireless medium\
    \ segment.\n   Given the fundamental differences between the two, it is likely\
    \ that\n   there are alternate QoS mechanisms between WTPs and wireless service\n\
    \   subscribers and between WTPs and WLAN controllers.  For instance, the\n  \
    \ former will be based on IEEE 802.11e, whereas the latter will be an\n   alternative.\
    \  So resources need to be adjusted in a coordinated\n   fashion over both segments.\
    \  The CAPWAP protocol should ensure that\n   these adjustments are appropriately\
    \ exchanged between WLAN\n   controllers and WTPs.\n   In addition to IEEE 802.11e,\
    \ there are a number of other IEEE 802.11\n   task groups that may affect network\
    \ resources.  These include IEEE\n   802.11 TGk, TGu, and TGv, which are currently\
    \ in progress.  CAPWAP\n   should therefore not be restricted to IEEE 802.11e-based\
    \ mapping.\n   Protocol Requirement:\n   The CAPWAP protocol MUST map the IEEE\
    \ 802.11e QoS priorities to\n   equivalent QoS priorities across the switching\
    \ and wireless medium\n   segments.\n   Motivation and Protocol Benefits:\n  \
    \ A protocol that addresses QoS aspects of WLAN systems will deliver\n   high\
    \ performance thereby being beneficial for subscribers and for\n   resource utilization\
    \ efficiency.  Since CAPWAP deals with WTPs\n   directly and with the wireless\
    \ medium indirectly, both of these must\n   be considered for performance.\n \
    \  For the wireless medium segment, QoS aspects in the protocol enable\n   high-quality\
    \ communications within the domain of a WLAN controller.\n   Since each domain\
    \ generally covers an enterprise or a group of\n   service providers, such protocol\
    \ performance has wide-ranging\n   effects.\n   Within the switching segment of\

    \   example, WTPs may need to regularly renew their authentication state\n   with\
    \ the WLAN controller and similarly for WLAN controllers.\n   If authentication\
    \ is performed via an authenticated key exchange,\n   future knowledge of derived\
    \ keys is not sufficient for\n   authentication.\n   Any session keys used between\
    \ the WLAN controller and WTPs MUST be\n   mutually derived using entropy contributed\
    \ by both parties.  This\n   ensures that no one party has control over the resulting\
    \ session\n   keys.\n   Once WTPs and the WLAN controller have been mutually authenticated,\n\
    \   information exchanges between them must be secured against various\n   security\
    \ threats.  So the CAPWAP protocol MUST provide integrity\n   protection and replay\
    \ protection.  The protocol SHOULD provide\n   confidentiality through encryption.\
    \  This should cover illegitimate\n   modifications to protocol exchanges, eavesdropping,\
    \ and Denial of\n   Service (DoS) attacks, among other potential compromises.\
    \  So the\n   protocol must provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity\n\
    \   for those exchanges.\n   As a result of realizing this objective, it should\
    \ not be possible\n   for individual WTP breaches to affect the security of the\
    \ WLAN as a\n   whole.  So WTP misuse will be protected against.\n   Additionally,\
    \ the key establishment protocol for authentication and\n   securing CAPWAP exchanges\
    \ must be designed to minimize the\n   possibility of future compromises after\
    \ the keys are established.\n   CAPWAP MUST NOT prevent the use of asymmetric\
    \ authentication.  The\n   security considerations of such asymmetric authentication\
    \ are\n   described in the Security Considerations section.\n   If the CAPWAP\
    \ protocol meets the criteria to require automated key\n   management per BCP\
    \ 107 [RFC4107], then mutual authentication MUST be\n   accomplished via an authenticated\
    \ key exchange.\n   Protocol Requirement:\n   The CAPWAP protocol MUST support\
    \ mutual authentication of WTPs and\n   the centralized controller.  It also MUST\
    \ ensure that information\n   exchanges are integrity protected and SHOULD ensure\
    \ confidentiality\n   through encryption.\n   Motivation and Protocol Benefits:\n\
    \   WLANs are increasingly deployed in critical aspects of enterprise and\n  \
    \ consumer networks.  In these contexts, protocol security is crucial\n   to ensure\
    \ the privacy and integrity expected from network\n   administrators and end-users.\
    \  So securing the CAPWAP protocol has\n   direct benefits in addressing these\
    \ concerns.\n   In many cases, the network path between a WTP and WLAN controller\n\
    \   contains untrusted links.  Such links could be leveraged by rogue\n   WTPs\
    \ to gain access to the WLAN system.  They could also be used by\n   rogue WLAN\
    \ controllers to gain control of legitimate WTPs and their\n   associated terminals\
    \ to either redirect or compromise terminal\n   traffic.  These security concerns\
    \ can be mitigated with this\n   objective.\n   Relation to Problem Statement:\n\
    \   Security problems in large-scale WLANs are detailed in the Problem\n   Statement.\
    \  These include complications arising from rogue WTPs and\n   compromised interfaces\
    \ between WTPs and the WLAN controller.  The\n   requirement for protocol security\
    \ addresses these problems and\n   highlights the importance of protecting against\

    \   The CAPWAP protocol must support authentication in the centralized\n   WLAN\

    \ on distinct entities, i.e., WLAN controller or WTP.\n   The Architecture Taxonomy\
    \ illustrates a number of variants, in both\n   local-MAC and split-MAC designs,\
    \ in which the authenticator is\n   located at the WLAN controller and the encryption\
    \ points are at the\n   WTPs.  The CAPWAP protocol must be applicable to these\
    \ variants and\n   allow authentication mechanisms and their constituent processes\
    \ to be\n   operable in these cases.\n   An important issue to consider in this\
    \ case is the exchange of key\n   information when authenticator and encryption\
    \ points are located on\n   distinct entities.  For example, consider the case\
    \ where IEEE 802.11i\n   is used in a WLAN in which the WLAN controller realizes\
    \ the\n   authenticator, some WTPs realize encryption (possibly local-MAC\n  \
    \ WTPs), and other WTPs rely on the WLAN controller for encryption\n   (possibly\
    \ split-MAC WTPs).\n   Here, CAPWAP will first need to identify the location of\
    \ the\n   authenticator and encryption points between each WLAN controller-WTP\n\
    \   pair.  This will likely be part of the initial WTP configuration.\n   Subsequently,\
    \ the WTPs that realize encryption will need CAPWAP to\n   exchange key information\

    \ CAPWAP protocol MUST determine the exact structure of the\n   centralized WLAN\

    \   Two major designs of the centralized WLAN architecture are local-MAC\n   and\

    \ it is crucial to ensure mutual interoperation among\n   them.\n   This objective\
    \ for the CAPWAP protocol is to ensure that WTPs of both\n   local-MAC and split-MAC\
    \ architecture designs are capable of\n   interoperation within a single WLAN.\
    \  Consequently, a single WLAN\n   controller will be capable of controlling both\
    \ types of WTPs using a\n   single CAPWAP protocol.  Integral support for these\
    \ designs comprises\n   a number of protocol aspects.\n   i.  Capability negotiations\
    \ between WLAN controller and WTPs\n   WTP designs differ in the degree of IEEE\

    \   In this regard, the CAPWAP protocol should include functionality that\n  \
    \ allows for negotiations of significant capabilities between WTPs and\n   the\

    \ of WTP,\n   split-MAC or local-MAC, as this provides substantial information\
    \ on\n   their respective capabilities.\n   ii.  Establishment of alternative\
    \ interfaces\n   The capability differences among different WTPs essentially equate\
    \ to\n   alternative interfaces with a WLAN controller.  So the CAPWAP\n   protocol\
    \ should be capable of adapting its operations to the major\n   different interfaces.\

    \ in\n   the control operations of local-MAC and split-MAC architecture\n   designs.\
    \  The Architecture Taxonomy tabulates major common features\n   of the two designs.\
    \  As a result, it is technically practical to\n   devise a single protocol that\
    \ manages both types of devices.\n   Next, the ability to operate a CAPWAP protocol\
    \ for both types of\n   architectural designs enhances its practical prospects\

  - "5.3.1.  Support for Non-CAPWAP WTPs\n   Classification: Architecture\n   Description:\n\
    \   The CAPWAP protocol should provide an engine-mechanism to spring WTP\n   auto-configuration\
    \ and/or software version updates and should support\n   integration with existing\
    \ network management system.  WLAN controller\n   as a management agent is optional.\n\
    \   If entities other than WLAN controllers manage some aspects of WTPs,\n   such\
    \ as software downloads, the CAPWAP protocol may be used for WTPs\n   to notify\
    \ WLAN controllers of any changes made by the other entities.\n   Protocol Requirement:\n\
    \   The CAPWAP protocol SHOULD be capable of recognizing legacy WTPs and\n   existing\
    \ network management systems.\n   Motivation and Protocol Benefits:\n   It is\
    \ expected that in many cases, the centralized WLAN architecture\n   will be deployed\
    \ incrementally with legacy systems.  In this regard,\n   it is necessary for\
    \ the protocol to be used in scenarios with mixed\n   WLAN devices.\n   Relation\
    \ to Problem Statement:\n   The Problem Statement highlights management complexity\
    \ as a major\n   issue with large WLANs.  One part of this complexity can be related\n\
    \   to the incremental deployment of centralized WLAN devices for which\n   this\
    \ objective is applicable.\n"

  - "5.3.2.  Technical Specifications\n   Classification: General\n   Description:\n\
    \   The CAPWAP protocol must not require AC and WTP vendors to share\n   technical\
    \ specifications to establish compatibility.  The protocol\n   specifications\
    \ alone must be sufficient for compatibility.\n   Protocol Requirement:\n   WTP\
    \ vendors SHOULD NOT have to share technical specifications for\n   hardware and\
    \ software to AC vendors in order for interoperability to\n   be achieved.\n \
    \  Motivation and Protocol Benefits:\n   It is beneficial for WLAN equipment vendors\
    \ to refer to a single set\n   of specifications while implementing the CAPWAP\
    \ protocol.  This helps\n   to ease and quicken the development process.\n   Relation\
    \ to Problem Statement:\n   This requirement is based on WG discussions that have\
    \ been determined\n   to be important for CAPWAP.\n   This objective has been\
    \ prioritized as a non-objective as it is a\n   duplicate of the Protocol Specifications\
    \ objective (Section 5.1.12).\n"

    \ service operators consider handoffs crucial because of the\n   mobile nature\
    \ of their customers.  In this regard, the CAPWAP\n   protocol should not adversely\
    \ affect AP fast-handoff procedures.  The\n   protocol may support optimizations\
    \ for fast handoff procedures so as\n   to allow better support for real-time\
    \ services during handoffs.\n   Protocol Requirement:\n   CAPWAP protocol operations\
    \ MUST NOT impede or obstruct the efficacy\n   of AP fast-handoff procedures.\n"
- title: 6.  Summary and Conclusion
  contents:
  - "6.  Summary and Conclusion\n   The objectives presented in this document address\
    \ three main aspects\n   of the CAPWAP protocol, namely:\n   i.  Architecture\n\
    \   ii.  Operations\n   iii.  Security\n   These requirements are aimed at focusing\
    \ standardization efforts on a\n   simple, interoperable protocol for managing\
    \ large-scale WLANs.  The\n   architecture requirements specify the structural\
    \ features of the\n   protocol such as those relating to WTP types (local-MAC\
    \ and split-\n   MAC) and WTP structures (logical groups).  The operations\n \
    \  requirements address the functional aspects dealing with WTP\n   configuration\
    \ and management.  Finally, the security requirements\n   cover authentication\
    \ and integrity aspects of protocol exchanges.\n   The objectives have additionally\
    \ been prioritized to reflect their\n   immediate significance to the development\
    \ and evaluation of an\n   interoperable CAPWAP protocol.  The priorities are\
    \ Mandatory and\n   Accepted, Desirable, and Non-Objectives.  They reflect working\
    \ group\n   consensus on the effectiveness of the requirements in the context\
    \ of\n   protocol design.\n   Additionally, this document includes requirements\
    \ from network\n   service operators that have been derived based on their experience\
    \ in\n   operating large-scale WLANs.\n   The resulting requirements from this\
    \ document will be used in\n   conjunction with the CAPWAP Problem Statement [RFC3990]\
    \ and CAPWAP\n   Architecture Taxonomy [RFC4118] to develop and evaluate an\n\
    \   interoperable protocol for the control and provisioning of WTPs in\n   large-scale\
    \ WLANs.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The CAPWAP framework highlights support for both\
    \ local-MAC and\n   split-MAC WTPs.  In deployments where both types of WTPs are\
    \ used, it\n   is crucial to ensure that each be secured in consideration of its\n\
    \   capabilities.  The Architecture Taxonomy illustrates how different\n   WTPs\
    \ incorporate varying levels of functionalities.  Development of\n   the CAPWAP\
    \ protocol should ensure that the deployment of both local-\n   MAC and split-MAC\
    \ WTPs within a single WLAN do not present loopholes\n   for security compromises.\n\
    \   In shared WLAN deployments made of a number of logical groups,\n   traffic\
    \ from each group needs to be mutually separated.  So in\n   addition to protocol-related\
    \ exchanges, data traffic from wireless\n   terminals should also be segregated\
    \ with respect to the logical\n   groups to which they belong.  It should not\
    \ be possible for data or\n   control traffic from one logical group to stray\
    \ to or influence\n   another logical group.\n   The use of IEEE 802.11i over\
    \ the centralized WLAN architecture allows\n   for implementations in which the\
    \ PMK is shared across WTPs.  This\n   raises the ambiguity between legitimate\
    \ sharing and illegitimate\n   copies.  Wireless terminals may unknowingly fall\
    \ prey to or exploit\n   this ambiguity.  The resolution of this issue is currently\
    \ being\n   evaluated by the IEEE 802 and IETF liaisons.\n   The low cost of launching\
    \ attacks on WLANs makes the CAPWAP protocol\n   a target.  A first step in securing\
    \ against any form of attacks is to\n   continuously monitor the WLAN for conditions\
    \ of potential threats\n   from rogue WTPs or wireless terminals.  For example,\
    \ profiles for DoS\n   and replay attacks need to be considered for the CAPWAP\
    \ protocol to\n   effectively monitor security conditions.\n   The open environment\
    \ of many WLAN deployments makes physical security\n   breaches highly probable.\
    \  Compromises resulting from theft and\n   physical damage must be considered\
    \ during protocol development.  For\n   instance, it should not be possible for\
    \ a single compromised WTP to\n   affect the WLAN as a whole.\n   Considering\
    \ asymmetric, non-mutual authentication between WTPs and\n   the WLAN controller,\
    \ there is a risk of a rogue participant\n   exploiting such an arrangement. \
    \ It is preferable to avoid non-mutual\n   authentication.  In some cases, the\
    \ legitimacy of the protocol\n   exchange participants may be verified externally,\
    \ for example, by\n   means of physical containment within a close environment.\
    \  Asymmetric\n   authentication may be appropriate here without risk of security\n\
    \   compromises.\n"
