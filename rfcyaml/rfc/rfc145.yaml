  - "              Initial Connection Protocol Control Commands\n     The following\
    \ is my interpretation of the exchange between NCP's\n   which would be necessary\
    \ to carry out the Initial Connection Protocol\n   of RFC #123.  (This note corrects\
    \ an error pointed out by Eric\n   Harslem of RAND).\n      Server NCP       \
