- title: 2.  Modern Paradigm for Standards
  contents:
  - "2.  Modern Paradigm for Standards\n   Over the past several decades, the global\
    \ economy has realized a huge\n   bounty due to the Internet and the World Wide\
    \ Web.  These could not\n   have been possible without the innovations and standardization\
    \ of\n   many underlying technologies.  This standardization occurred with\n \
    \  great speed and effectiveness only because of key characteristics of\n   a\
    \ modern global standards paradigm.  The affirmation below\n   characterizes the\
    \ principles that have led to this success as a means\n   to ensure acceptance\
    \ of standards activities that adhere to the\n   principles.\n   We embrace a\
    \ modern paradigm for standards where the economics of\n   global markets, fueled\
    \ by technological advancements, drive global\n   deployment of standards regardless\
    \ of their formal status.\n   In this paradigm standards support interoperability,\
    \ foster global\n   competition, are developed through an open participatory process,\
    \ and\n   are voluntarily adopted globally.  These voluntary standards serve as\n\
    \   building blocks for products and services targeted at meeting the\n   needs\
    \ of the market and consumer, thereby driving innovation.\n   Innovation in turn\
    \ contributes to the creation of new markets and the\n   growth and expansion\
    \ of existing markets.\n   Participation in the modern paradigm demands:\n   1.\
    \ Cooperation.  Respectful cooperation between standards\n      organizations,\
    \ whereby each respects the autonomy, integrity,\n      processes, and intellectual\
    \ property rules of the others.\n   2. Adherence to principles.  Adherence to\
    \ the five fundamental\n      principles of standards development:\n      * Due\
    \ process.  Decisions are made with equity and fairness among\n        participants.\
    \  No one party dominates or guides standards\n        development.  Standards\
    \ processes are transparent and\n        opportunities exist to appeal decisions.\
    \  Processes for periodic\n        standards review and updating are well defined.\n\
    \      * Broad consensus.  Processes allow for all views to be considered\n  \
    \      and addressed, such that agreement can be found across a range\n      \
    \  of interests.\n      * Transparency.  Standards organizations provide advance\
    \ public\n        notice of proposed standards development activities, the scope\n\
    \        of work to be undertaken, and conditions for participation.\n       \
    \ Easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used in\n        reaching\
    \ those decisions are provided.  Public comment periods\n        are provided\
    \ before final standards approval and adoption.\n      * Balance.  Standards activities\
    \ are not exclusively dominated by\n        any particular person, company or\
    \ interest group.\n      * Openness.  Standards processes are open to all interested\
    \ and\n        informed parties.\n   3. Collective empowerment.  Commitment by\
    \ affirming standards\n      organizations and their participants to collective\
    \ empowerment by\n      striving for standards that:\n      * are chosen and defined\
    \ based on technical merit, as judged by\n        the contributed expertise of\
    \ each participant;\n      * provide global interoperability, scalability, stability,\
    \ and\n        resiliency;\n      * enable global competition;\n      * serve\
    \ as building blocks for further innovation; and\n      * contribute to the creation\
    \ of global communities, benefiting\n        humanity.\n   4. Availability.  Standards\
    \ specifications are made accessible to all\n      for implementation and deployment.\
    \  Affirming standards\n      organizations have defined procedures to develop\
    \ specifications\n      that can be implemented under fair terms.  Given market\
    \ diversity,\n      fair terms may vary from royalty-free to fair, reasonable,\
    \ and\n      non-discriminatory terms (FRAND).\n   5. Voluntary adoption.  Standards\
    \ are voluntarily adopted and success\n      is determined by the market.\n"
