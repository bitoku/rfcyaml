  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a threat model for the context in which\n\
    \   External Border Gateway Protocol (EBGP) path security mechanisms will\n  \
    \ be developed.  The threat model includes an analysis of the Resource\n   Public\
    \ Key Infrastructure (RPKI) and focuses on the ability of an\n   Autonomous System\
    \ (AS) to verify the authenticity of the AS path info\n   received in a BGP update.\
    \  We use the term \"PATHSEC\" to refer to any\n   BGP path security technology\
    \ that makes use of the RPKI.  PATHSEC\n   will secure BGP, consistent with the\
    \ inter-AS security focus of the\n   RPKI.\n   The document characterizes classes\
    \ of potential adversaries that are\n   considered to be threats and examines\
    \ classes of attacks that might\n   be launched against PATHSEC.  It does not\
    \ revisit attacks against\n   unprotected BGP, as that topic has already been\
    \ addressed in the\n   BGP-4 standard.  It concludes with a brief discussion of\
    \ residual\n   vulnerabilities.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the security context in which PATHSEC\
    \ is\n   intended to operate.  The term \"PATHSEC\" (for path security) refers\n\
    \   to any design used to preserve the integrity and authenticity of the\n   AS_PATH\
    \ attribute carried in a BGP update message [RFC4271].  The\n   security context\
    \ used throughout this document is established by the\n   Secure Inter-Domain\
    \ Routing (SIDR) working group charter [SIDR-CH].\n   The charter requires that\
    \ solutions that afford PATHSEC make use of\n   the Resource Public Key Infrastructure\
    \ (RPKI) [RFC6480].  It also\n   calls for protecting only the information required\
    \ to verify that a\n   received route traversed the Autonomous Systems (ASes)\
    \ in question,\n   and that the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)\
    \ in the\n   route is what was advertised.\n   Thus, the goal of PATHSEC is to\
    \ enable a BGP speaker to verify that\n   the ASes enumerated in this path attribute\
    \ represent the sequence of\n   ASes that the NLRI traversed.  The term \"PATHSEC\"\
    \ is thus consistent\n   with the goal described above.  (Other SIDR documents\
    \ use the term\n   \"BGPSEC\" to refer to a specific design; we avoid use of that\
    \ term\n   here.)\n   This document discusses classes of potential adversaries\
    \ that are\n   considered to be threats, and classes of attacks that might be\n\
    \   launched against PATHSEC.  Because PATHSEC will rely on the RPKI,\n   threats\
    \ and attacks against the RPKI are included.  This model also\n   takes into consideration\
    \ classes of attacks that are enabled by the\n   use of PATHSEC (e.g., based on\
    \ use of the RPKI).\n   The motivation for developing PATHSEC, i.e., residual\
    \ security\n   concerns for BGP, is well described in several documents, including\n\
    \   \"BGP Security Vulnerabilities Analysis\" [RFC4272] and \"Design and\n   Analysis\
    \ of the Secure Border Gateway Protocol (S-BGP)\" [Kent2000].\n   All of these\
    \ documents note that BGP does not include mechanisms that\n   allow an AS to\
    \ verify the legitimacy and authenticity of BGP route\n   advertisements.  (BGP\
    \ now mandates support for mechanisms to secure\n   peer-to-peer communication,\
    \ i.e., for the links that connect BGP\n   routers.  There are several secure\
    \ protocol options to address this\n   security concern, e.g., IPsec [RFC4301]\
    \ and TCP Authentication Option\n   (TCP-AO) [RFC5925].  This document briefly\
    \ notes the need to address\n   this aspect of BGP security, but focuses on application\
    \ layer BGP\n   security issues that must be addressed by PATHSEC.)\n   RFC 4272\
    \ [RFC4272] succinctly notes:\n      BGP speakers themselves can inject bogus\
    \ routing information,\n      either by masquerading as any other legitimate BGP\
    \ speaker, or by\n      distributing unauthorized routing information as themselves.\n\
    \      Historically, misconfigured and faulty routers have been\n      responsible\
    \ for widespread disruptions in the Internet.  The\n      legitimate BGP peers\
    \ have the context and information to produce\n      believable, yet bogus, routing\
    \ information, and therefore have the\n      opportunity to cause great damage.\
    \  The cryptographic protections\n      of [TCPMD5] and operational protections\
    \ cannot exclude the bogus\n      information arising from a legitimate peer.\
    \  The risk of\n      disruptions caused by legitimate BGP speakers is real and\
    \ cannot\n      be ignored.\n   PATHSEC is intended to address the concerns cited\
    \ above, to provide\n   significantly improved path security, which builds upon\
    \ the route\n   origination validation capability offered by use of the RPKI\n\
    \   [RFC6810].  Specifically, the RPKI enables relying parties (RPs) to\n   determine\
    \ if the origin AS for a path was authorized to advertise the\n   prefix contained\
    \ in a BGP update message.  This security feature is\n   enabled by the use of\
    \ two types of digitally signed data: a PKI\n   [RFC6487] that associates one\
    \ or more prefixes with the public key(s)\n   of an address space holder, and\
    \ Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)\n   [RFC6482] that allow a prefix holder\
    \ to specify one or more ASes that\n   are authorized to originate routes for\
    \ a prefix.\n   The security model adopted for PATHSEC does not assume an \"oracle\"\
    \n   that can see all of the BGP inputs and outputs associated with every\n  \
    \ AS or every BGP router.  Instead, the model is based on a local\n   notion of\
    \ what constitutes legitimate, authorized behavior by the BGP\n   routers associated\
    \ with an AS.  This is an AS-centric model of secure\n   operation, consistent\
    \ with the AS-centric model that BGP employs for\n   routing.  This model forms\
    \ the basis for the discussion that follows.\n   This document begins with a brief\
    \ set of definitions relevant to the\n   subsequent sections.  It then discusses\
    \ classes of adversaries that\n   are perceived as viable threats against routing\
    \ in the public\n   Internet.  It continues to explore a range of attacks that\
    \ might be\n   effected by these adversaries against both path security and the\n\
    \   infrastructure upon which PATHSEC relies.  It concludes with a brief\n   review\
    \ of residual vulnerabilities, i.e., vulnerabilities that are\n   not addressed\
    \ by use of the RPKI and that appear likely to be outside\n   the scope of PATHSEC\
    \ mechanisms.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The following security and routing terminology definitions\
    \ are\n   employed in this document.\n   Adversary:  An adversary is an entity\
    \ (e.g., a person or an\n      organization) that is perceived as malicious, relative\
    \ to the\n      security policy of a system.  The decision to characterize an\n\
    \      entity as an adversary is made by those responsible for the\n      security\
    \ of a system.  Often, one describes classes of adversaries\n      with similar\
    \ capabilities or motivations rather than specific\n      individuals or organizations.\n\
    \   Attack:  An attack is an action that attempts to violate the security\n  \
    \    policy of a system, e.g., by exploiting a vulnerability.  There is\n    \
    \  often a many-to-one mapping of attacks to vulnerabilities because\n      many\
    \ different attacks may be used to exploit a vulnerability.\n   Autonomous System\
    \ (AS):  An AS is a set of one or more IP networks\n      operated by a single\
    \ administrative entity.\n   AS Number (ASN):  An ASN is a 2- or 4-byte number\
    \ issued by a\n      registry to identify an AS in BGP.\n   Certification Authority\
    \ (CA):  An entity that issues digital\n      certificates (e.g., X.509 certificates)\
    \ and vouches for the\n      binding between the data items in a certificate.\n\
    \   Countermeasure:  A countermeasure is a procedure or technique that\n     \
    \ thwarts an attack, preventing it from being successful.  Often,\n      countermeasures\
    \ are specific to attacks or classes of attacks.\n   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP):\
    \  A path vector protocol used to convey\n      \"reachability\" information among\
    \ ASes in support of inter-domain\n      routing.\n   False (Route) Origination:\
    \  If a network operator originates a route\n      for a prefix that the operator\
    \ does not hold (and that has not\n      been authorized to originate by the prefix\
    \ holder), this is termed\n      false route origination.\n   Internet Service\
    \ Provider (ISP):  An organization managing (and\n      typically selling) Internet\
    \ services to other organizations or\n      individuals.\n   Internet Number Resources\
    \ (INRs):  IPv4 or IPv6 address space and\n      ASNs.\n   Internet Registry:\
    \  An organization that manages the allocation or\n      distribution of INRs.\
    \  This encompasses the Internet Assigned\n      Number Authority (IANA), Regional\
    \ Internet Registries (RIRs),\n      National Internet Registries (NIRs), and\
    \ Local Internet Registries\n      (LIRs) (network operators).\n   Man in the\
    \ Middle (MITM):  A MITM is an entity that is able to\n      examine and modify\
    \ traffic between two (or more) parties on a\n      communication path.\n   Network\
    \ Operator:  An entity that manages an AS and thus emits (E)BGP\n      updates,\
    \ e.g., an ISP.\n   Network Operations Center (NOC):  A network operator employs\
    \ a set of\n      equipment and a staff to manage a network, typically on a 24/7\n\
    \      basis.  The equipment and staff are often referred to as the NOC\n    \
    \  for the network.\n   Prefix:  A prefix is an IP address and a mask used to\
    \ specify a set\n      of addresses that are grouped together for purposes of\
    \ routing.\n   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):  A PKI is a collection of hardware,\n\
    \      software, people, policies, and procedures used to create, manage,\n  \
    \    distribute, store, and revoke digital certificates.\n   Relying Parties (RPs):\
    \  An RP is an entity that makes use of signed\n      products from a PKI, i.e.,\
    \ it relies on signed data that is\n      verified using certificates and Certificate\
    \ Revocation Lists\n      (CRLs) from a PKI.\n   RPKI Repository System:  The\
    \ RPKI repository system consists of a\n      distributed set of loosely synchronized\
    \ databases.\n   Resource PKI (RPKI):  A PKI operated by the entities that manage\
    \ INRs\n      and that issue X.509 certificates (and CRLs) that attest to the\n\
    \      holdings of INRs.\n   RPKI Signed Object:  An RPKI signed object is a data\
    \ object\n      encapsulated with Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) that complies\n\
    \      with the format and semantics defined in [RFC6488].\n   Route:  In the\
    \ Internet, a route is a prefix and an associated\n      sequence of ASNs that\
    \ indicates a path via which traffic destined\n      for the prefix can be directed.\
    \  (The route includes the origin\n      AS.)\n   Route Leak:  A route leak is\
    \ said to occur when AS-A advertises\n      routes that it has received from AS-B\
    \ to the neighbors of AS-A,\n      but AS-A is not viewed as a transit provider\
    \ for the prefixes in\n      the route.\n   Threat:  A threat is a motivated,\
    \ capable adversary.  An adversary\n      that is not motivated to launch an attack\
    \ is not a threat.  An\n      adversary that is motivated but not capable of launching\
    \ an attack\n      also is not a threat.\n   Vulnerability:  A vulnerability is\
    \ a flaw or weakness in a system's\n      design, implementation, or operation\
    \ and management that could be\n      exploited to violate the security policy\
    \ of a system.\n"
- title: 3.  Threat Characterization
  contents:
  - "3.  Threat Characterization\n   As noted in Section 2 above, a threat is defined\
    \ as a motivated,\n   capable adversary.  The following classes of threats represent\n\
    \   classes of adversaries viewed as relevant to this environment.\n      Network\
    \ Operators: A network operator may be a threat.  An\n      operator may be motivated\
    \ to cause BGP routers it controls to emit\n      update messages with inaccurate\
    \ routing info, e.g., to cause\n      traffic to flow via paths that are economically\
    \ advantageous for\n      the operator.  Such updates might cause traffic to flow\
    \ via paths\n      that would otherwise be rejected as less advantageous by other\n\
    \      network operators.  Because an operator controls the BGP routers\n    \
    \  in its network, it is in a position to modify their operation in\n      arbitrary\
    \ ways.  Routers managed by a network operator are\n      vehicles for mounting\
    \ MITM attacks on both control and data plane\n      traffic.  If an operator\
    \ participates in the RPKI, it will have at\n      least one CA resource certificate\
    \ and may be able to generate an\n      arbitrary number of subordinate CA certificates\
    \ and ROAs.  It will\n      be authorized to populate (and may even host) its\
    \ own repository\n      publication point.  If it implements PATHSEC, and if PATHSEC\
    \ makes\n      use of certificates associated with routers or ASes, it will have\n\
    \      the ability to issue such certificates for itself.  If PATHSEC\n      digitally\
    \ signs updates, it will be able to do so in a fashion\n      that will be accepted\
    \ by PATHSEC-enabled neighbors.\n      Hackers: Hackers are considered a threat.\
    \  A hacker might assume\n      control of network management computers and routers\
    \ controlled by\n      operators, including operators that implement PATHSEC.\
    \  In such\n      cases, hackers would be able to act as rogue network operators\n\
    \      (see above).  It is assumed that hackers generally do not have the\n  \
    \    capability to effect MITM attacks on most links between networks\n      (links\
    \ used to transmit BGP and subscriber traffic).  A hacker\n      might be recruited,\
    \ without his/her knowledge, by criminals or by\n      nations, to act on their\
    \ behalf.  Hackers may be motivated by a\n      desire for \"bragging rights\"\
    , for profit, or to express support\n      for a cause (\"hacktivists\" [Sam04]).\
    \  We view hackers as possibly\n      distinct from criminals in that the former\
    \ are presumed to effect\n      attacks only remotely (not via a physical presence\
    \ associated with\n      a target) and not necessarily for monetary gain.  Some\
    \ hackers may\n      commit criminal acts (depending on the jurisdiction), and\
    \ thus\n      there is a potential for overlap between this adversary group and\n\
    \      criminals.\n      Criminals: Criminals may be a threat.  Criminals might\
    \ persuade\n      (via threats or extortion) a network operator to act as a rogue\n\
    \      operator (see above) and thus be able to effect a wide range of\n     \
    \ attacks.  Criminals might persuade the staff of a\n      telecommunications\
    \ provider to enable MITM attacks on links\n      between routers.  Motivations\
    \ for criminals may include the\n      ability to extort money from network operators\
    \ or network operator\n      clients, e.g., by adversely affecting routing for\
    \ these network\n      operators or their clients.  Criminals also may wish to\
    \ manipulate\n      routing to conceal the sources of spam, DoS attacks, or other\n\
    \      criminal activities.\n      Registries: Any registry in the RPKI could\
    \ be a threat.  Staff at\n      the registry are capable of manipulating repository\
    \ content or\n      mismanaging the RPKI certificates that they issue.  These\
    \ actions\n      could adversely affect a network operator or a client of a network\n\
    \      operator.  The staff could be motivated to do this based on\n      political\
    \ pressure from the nation in which the registry operates\n      (see below) or\
    \ due to criminal influence (see above).\n      Nations: A nation may be a threat.\
    \  A nation may control one or\n      more network operators that operate in the\
    \ nation, and thus can\n      cause them to act as rogue network operators.  A\
    \ nation may have a\n      technical active wiretapping capability (e.g., within\
    \ its\n      territory) that enables it to effect MITM attacks on inter-network\n\
    \      traffic.  (This capability may be facilitated by control or\n      influence\
    \ over a telecommunications provider operating within the\n      nation.)  It\
    \ may have an ability to attack and take control of\n      routers or management\
    \ network computers of network operators in\n      other countries.  A nation\
    \ may control a registry (e.g., an RIR)\n      that operates within its territory\
    \ and might force that registry\n      to act in a rogue capacity.  National threat\
    \ motivations include\n      the desire to control the flow of traffic to/from\
    \ the nation or to\n      divert traffic destined for other nations (for passive\
    \ or active\n      wiretapping, including DoS).\n"
- title: 4.  Attack Characterization
  contents:
  - "4.  Attack Characterization\n   This section describes classes of attacks that\
    \ may be effected\n   against Internet routing (relative to the context described\
    \ in\n   Section 1).  Attacks are classified based on the target of the\n   attack,\
    \ an element of the routing system, or the routing security\n   infrastructure\
    \ on which PATHSEC relies.  In general, attacks of\n   interest are ones that\
    \ attempt to violate the integrity or\n   authenticity of BGP traffic or that\
    \ violate the authorizations\n   associated with entities participating in the\
    \ RPKI.  Attacks that\n   violate the implied confidentiality of routing traffic,\
    \ e.g., passive\n   wiretapping attacks, are not considered a requirement for\
    \ BGP\n   security (see [RFC4272]).\n"
- title: 4.1.  Active Wiretapping of Sessions between Routers
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Active Wiretapping of Sessions between Routers\n   An adversary may attack\
    \ the BGP (TCP) session that connects a pair of\n   BGP speakers.  An active attack\
    \ against a BGP (TCP) session can be\n   effected by directing traffic to a BGP\
    \ speaker from some remote\n   point, or by being positioned as a MITM on the\
    \ link that carries BGP\n   session traffic.  Remote attacks can be effected by\
    \ any adversary.  A\n   MITM attack requires access to the link.  Modern transport\
    \ networks\n   may be as complex as the packet networks that utilize them for\
    \ inter-\n   AS links.  Thus, these transport networks may present significant\n\
    \   attack surfaces.  Nonetheless, only some classes of adversaries are\n   assumed\
    \ to be capable of MITM attacks against a BGP session.  MITM\n   attacks may be\
    \ directed against BGP and PATHSEC-protected BGP, or\n   against TCP or IP.  Such\
    \ attacks include replay of selected BGP\n   messages, selective modification\
    \ of BGP messages, and DoS attacks\n   against BGP routers.  [RFC4272] describes\
    \ several countermeasures for\n   such attacks, and thus this document does not\
    \ further address such\n   attacks.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Attacks on a BGP Router
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Attacks on a BGP Router\n   An adversary may attack a BGP router, whether\
    \ or not it implements\n   PATHSEC.  Any adversary that controls routers legitimately,\
    \ or that\n   can assume control of a router, is assumed to be able to effect\
    \ the\n   types of attacks described below.  Note that any router behavior that\n\
    \   can be ascribed to a local routing policy decision is not considered\n   to\
    \ be an attack.  This is because such behavior could be explained as\n   a result\
    \ of local policy settings and thus is beyond the scope of\n   what PATHSEC can\
    \ detect as unauthorized behavior.  Thus, for example,\n   a router may fail to\
    \ propagate some or all route withdrawals or\n   effect \"route leaks\".  (These\
    \ behaviors are not precluded by the\n   specification for BGP and might be the\
    \ result of a local policy that\n   is not publicly disclosed.  As a result, they\
    \ are not considered\n   attacks.  See Section 5 for additional discussion.)\n\
    \   Attacks on a router are equivalent to active wiretapping attacks (in\n   the\
    \ most general sense) that manipulate (forge, tamper with, or\n   suppress) data\
    \ contained in BGP updates.  The list below illustrates\n   attacks of this type.\n\
    \      AS Insertion: A router might insert one or more ASNs, other than\n    \
    \  its own ASN, into an update message.  This violates the BGP spec\n      and\
    \ thus is considered an attack.\n      False (Route) Origination: A router might\
    \ originate a route for a\n      prefix when the AS that the router represents\
    \ is not authorized to\n      originate routes for that prefix.  This is an attack,\
    \ but it is\n      addressed by the use of the RPKI [RFC6480].\n      Secure Path\
    \ Downgrade: A router might remove AS_PATH data from a\n      PATHSEC-protected\
    \ update that it receives when forwarding this\n      update to a PATHSEC-enabled\
    \ neighbor.  This behavior violates the\n      PATHSEC security goals and thus\
    \ is considered an attack.\n      Invalid AS_PATH Data Insertion: A router might\
    \ emit a PATHSEC-\n      protected update with \"bad\" data (such as a signature),\
    \ i.e.,\n      PATHSEC data that cannot be validated by other PATHSEC routers.\n\
    \      Such behavior is assumed to violate the PATHSEC goals and thus is\n   \
    \   considered an attack.\n      Stale Path Announcement: If PATHSEC-secured announcements\
    \ can\n      expire, such an announcement may be propagated with PATHSEC data\n\
    \      that is \"expired\".  This behavior would violate the PATHSEC goals\n \
    \     and is considered a type of replay attack.\n      Premature Path Announcement\
    \ Expiration: If a PATHSEC-secured\n      announcement has an associated expiration\
    \ time, a router might\n      emit a PATHSEC-secured announcement with an expiry\
    \ time that is\n      very short.  Unless the PATHSEC protocol specification mandates\
    \ a\n      minimum expiry time, this is not an attack.  However, if such a\n \
    \     time is mandated, this behavior becomes an attack.  BGP speakers\n     \
    \ along a path generally cannot determine if an expiry time is\n      \"suspiciously\
    \ short\" since they cannot know how long a route may\n      have been held by\
    \ an earlier AS, prior to being released.\n      MITM Attack: A cryptographic\
    \ key used for point-to-point security\n      (e.g., TCP-AO, TLS, or IPsec) between\
    \ two BGP routers might be\n      compromised (e.g., by extraction from a router).\
    \  This would\n      enable an adversary to effect MITM attacks on the link(s)\
    \ where\n      the key is used.  Use of specific security mechanisms to protect\n\
    \      inter-router links between ASes is outside the scope of PATHSEC.\n    \
    \  Compromised Router Private Key: If PATHSEC mechanisms employ\n      public\
    \ key cryptography, e.g., to digitally sign data in an\n      update, then a private\
    \ key associated with a router or an AS might\n      be compromised by an attack\
    \ against the router.  An adversary with\n      access to this key would be able\
    \ to generate updates that appear\n      to have passed through the AS that this\
    \ router represents.  Such\n      updates might be injected on a link between\
    \ the compromised router\n      and its neighbors if that link is accessible to\
    \ the adversary.  If\n      the adversary controls another network, it could use\
    \ this key to\n      forge signatures that appear to come from the AS or router(s)\
    \ in\n      question, with some constraints.  So, for example, an adversary\n\
    \      that controls another AS could use a compromised router/AS key to\n   \
    \   issue PATHSEC-signed data that includes the targeted router/AS.\n      (Neighbors\
    \ of the adversary's AS ought not accept a route that\n      purports to emanate\
    \ directly from the targeted AS.  So, an\n      adversary could take a legitimate,\
    \ protected route that passes\n      through the compromised AS, add itself as\
    \ the next hop, and then\n      forward the resulting route to neighbors.)\n \
    \     Withdrawal Suppression Attack: A PATHSEC-protected update may be\n     \
    \ signed and announced, and later withdrawn.  An adversary\n      controlling\
    \ intermediate routers could fail to propagate the\n      withdrawal.  BGP is\
    \ already vulnerable to behavior of this sort,\n      so withdrawal suppression\
    \ is not characterized as an attack under\n      the assumptions upon which this\
    \ mode is based (i.e., no oracle).\n"

  - "4.3.  Attacks on Network Operator Management Computers (Non-CA\n      Computers)\n\
    \   An adversary may choose to attack computers used by a network\n   operator\
    \ to manage its network, especially its routers.  Such attacks\n   might be effected\
    \ by an adversary who has compromised the security of\n   these computers.  This\
    \ might be effected via remote attacks,\n   extortion of network operations staff,\
    \ etc.  If an adversary\n   compromises NOC computers, he can execute any management\
    \ function\n   that authorized network operations the staff would have performed.\n\
    \   Thus, the adversary could modify the local routing policy to change\n   preferences,\
    \ to black-hole certain routes, etc.  This type of\n   behavior cannot be externally\
    \ detected as an attack.  Externally,\n   this appears as a form of rogue operator\
    \ behavior.  (Such behavior\n   might be perceived as accidental or malicious\
    \ by other operators.)\n   If a network operator participates in the RPKI, an\
    \ adversary could\n   manipulate the RP tools that extract data from the RPKI,\
    \ causing the\n   output of these tools to be corrupted in various ways.  For\
    \ example,\n   an attack of this sort could cause the operator to view valid routes\n\
    \   as not validated, which could alter its routing behavior.\n   If an adversary\
    \ invoked the tool used to manage the repository\n   publication point for this\
    \ operator, it could delete any objects\n   stored there (certificates, CRLs,\
    \ manifests, ROAs, or subordinate CA\n   certificates).  This could affect the\
    \ routing status of entities that\n   have allocations/assignments from this network\
    \ operator (e.g., by\n   deleting their CA certificates).\n   An adversary could\
    \ invoke the tool used to request certificate\n   revocation, causing router certificates,\
    \ ROAs, or subordinate CA\n   certificates to be revoked.  An attack of this sort\
    \ could affect not\n   only this operator but also any operators that receive\
    \ allocations/\n   assignments from it, e.g., because their CA certificates were\n\
    \   revoked.\n   If an operator is PATHSEC-enabled, an attack of this sort could\
    \ cause\n   the affected operator to be viewed as not PATHSEC-enabled, possibly\n\
    \   making routes it emits less preferable to other operators.\n   If an adversary\
    \ invoked a tool used to request ROAs, it could\n   effectively reallocate some\
    \ of the prefixes allocated/assigned to the\n   network operator (e.g., by modifying\
    \ the origin AS in ROAs).  This\n   might cause other PATHSEC-enabled networks\
    \ to view the affected\n   network as no longer originating routes for these prefixes.\
    \  Multi-\n   homed subscribers of this operator who received an allocation from\n\
    \   the operator might find that their traffic was routed via other\n   connections.\n\
    \   If the network operator is PATHSEC-enabled, and makes use of\n   certificates\
    \ associated with routers/ASes, an adversary could invoke\n   a tool used to request\
    \ such certificates.  The adversary could then\n   replace valid certificates\
    \ for routers/ASes with ones that might be\n   rejected by PATHSEC-enabled neighbors.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Attacks on a Repository Publication Point
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Attacks on a Repository Publication Point\n   A critical element of the\
    \ RPKI is the repository system.  An\n   adversary might attack a repository,\
    \ or a publication point within a\n   repository, to adversely affect routing.\n\
    \   This section considers only those attacks that can be launched by any\n  \
    \ adversary who controls a computer hosting one or more repository\n   publication\
    \ points, without access to the cryptographic keys needed\n   to generate valid\
    \ RPKI-signed products.  Such attacks might be\n   effected by an insider or an\
    \ external threat.  Because all repository\n   objects are digitally signed, attacks\
    \ of this sort translate into DoS\n   attacks against the RPKI RPs.  There are\
    \ a few distinct forms of such\n   attacks, as described below.\n   Note first\
    \ that the RPKI calls for RPs to cache the data they acquire\n   and verify from\
    \ the repository system [RFC6480][RFC6481].  Attacks\n   that delete signed products,\
    \ insert products with \"bad\" signatures,\n   tamper with object signatures,\
    \ or replace newer objects with older\n   (valid) ones, can be detected by RPs\
    \ (with a few exceptions).  RPs\n   are expected to make use of local caches.\
    \  If repository publication\n   points are unavailable or the retrieved data\
    \ is corrupted, an RP can\n   revert to using the cached data.  This behavior\
    \ helps insulate RPs\n   from the immediate effects of DoS attacks on publication\
    \ points.\n   Each RPKI data object has an associated date on which it expires\
    \ or\n   is considered stale (certificates expire and CRLs become stale).\n  \
    \ When an RP uses cached data, how to deal with stale or expired data\n   is a\
    \ local decision.  It is common in PKIs to make use of stale\n   certificate revocation\
    \ status data when fresher data is not\n   available.  Use of expired certificates\
    \ is less common, although not\n   unknown.  Each RP will decide, locally, whether\
    \ to continue to make\n   use of or ignore cached RPKI objects that are stale\
    \ or expired.\n   If an adversary inserts an object into a publication point,\
    \ and the\n   object has a \"bad\" signature, the object will not be accepted\
    \ and\n   used by RPs.\n   If an adversary modifies any signed product at a publication\
    \ point,\n   the signature on the product will fail, causing RPs to not accept\
    \ it.\n   This is equivalent to deleting the object, in many respects.\n   If\
    \ an adversary deletes one or more CA certificates, ROAs, or the CRL\n   for a\
    \ publication point, the manifest for that publication point will\n   allow an\
    \ RP to detect this attack.  An RP can continue to use the\n   last valid instance\
    \ of the deleted object (as a local policy option),\n   thus minimizing the impact\
    \ of such an attack.\n   If an adversary deletes a manifest (and does not replace\
    \ it with an\n   older instance), RPs are able to detect this action.  Such behavior\n\
    \   should result in the CA (or publication point maintainer) being\n   notified\
    \ of the problem.  An RP can continue to use the last valid\n   instance of the\
    \ deleted manifest (a local policy option), thus\n   minimizing the impact of\
    \ such an attack.\n   If an adversary deletes newly added CA certificates or ROAs,\
    \ and\n   replaces the current manifest with the previous manifest, the\n   manifest\
    \ (and the CRL that it matches) will be \"stale\" (see\n   [RFC6486]).  This alerts\
    \ an RP that there may be a problem.  The RP\n   should use the information from\
    \ a Ghostbuster Record [RFC6493] to\n   contact the entity responsible for the\
    \ publication point and request\n   a remedy to the problem (e.g., republish the\
    \ missing CA certificates\n   and/or ROAs).  An RP cannot know the content of\
    \ the new certificates\n   or ROAs that are not present, but it can continue to\
    \ use what it has\n   cached.  An attack of this sort will, at least temporarily,\
    \ cause RPs\n   to be unaware of the newly published objects.  INRs associated\
    \ with\n   these objects will be treated as unauthenticated.\n   If a CA revokes\
    \ a CA certificate or a ROA (via deleting the\n   corresponding End Entity (EE)\
    \ certificate), and the adversary tries\n   to reinstate that CA certificate or\
    \ ROA, the adversary would have to\n   rollback the CRL and the manifest to undo\
    \ this action by the CA.  As\n   above, this would make the CRL and manifest stale,\
    \ and this is\n   detectable by RPs.  An RP cannot know which CA certificates\
    \ or ROAs\n   were deleted.  Depending on local policy, the RP might use the cached\n\
    \   instances of the affected objects and thus be tricked into making\n   decisions\
    \ based on these revoked objects.  Here too, the goal is that\n   the CA will\
    \ be notified of the problem (by RPs) and will remedy the\n   error.\n   In the\
    \ attack scenarios above, when a CRL or manifest is described as\n   stale, this\
    \ means that the next issue date for the CRL or manifest\n   has passed.  Until\
    \ the next issue date, an RP will not detect the\n   attack.  Thus, it behooves\
    \ CAs to select CRL/manifest lifetimes (the\n   two are linked) that represent\
    \ an acceptable trade-off between risk\n   and operational burdens.\n   Attacks\
    \ effected by adversaries that are legitimate managers of\n   publication points\
    \ can have much greater effects and are discussed\n   below under attacks on or\
    \ by CAs.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Attacks on an RPKI CA
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Attacks on an RPKI CA\n   Every entity to which INRs have been allocated/assigned\
    \ is a CA in\n   the RPKI.  Each CA is nominally responsible for managing the\n\
    \   repository publication point for the set of signed products that it\n   generates.\
    \  (An INR holder may choose to outsource the operation of\n   the RPKI CA function\
    \ and the associated publication point.  In such\n   cases, the organization operating\
    \ on behalf of the INR holder becomes\n   the CA from an operational and security\
    \ perspective.  The following\n   discussion does not distinguish such outsourced\
    \ CA operations.)\n   Note that attacks attributable to a CA may be the result\
    \ of malice by\n   the CA (i.e., the CA is the adversary), or they may result\
    \ from a\n   compromise of the CA.\n   All of the adversaries listed in Section\
    \ 2 are presumed to be capable\n   of launching attacks against the computers\
    \ used to perform CA\n   functions.  Some adversaries might effect an attack on\
    \ a CA by\n   violating personnel or physical security controls as well.  The\n\
    \   distinction between the CA as an adversary versus the CA as an attack\n  \
    \ victim is important.  Only in the latter case should one expect the\n   CA to\
    \ remedy problems caused by an attack once the attack has been\n   detected. \
    \ (If a CA does not take such action, the effects are the\n   same as if the CA\
    \ is an adversary.)\n   Note that most of the attacks described below do not require\n\
    \   disclosure of a CA's private key to an adversary.  If the adversary\n   can\
    \ gain control of the computer used to issue certificates, it can\n   effect these\
    \ attacks, even though the private key for the CA remains\n   \"secure\" (i.e.,\
    \ not disclosed to unauthorized parties).  However, if\n   the CA is not the adversary,\
    \ and if the CA's private key is not\n   compromised, then recovery from these\
    \ attacks is much easier.  This\n   motivates use of hardware security modules\
    \ to protect CA keys, at\n   least for higher tiers in the RPKI.\n   An attack\
    \ by a CA can result in revocation or replacement of any of\n   the certificates\
    \ that the CA has issued.  Revocation of a certificate\n   should cause RPs to\
    \ delete the (formerly) valid certificate (and\n   associated signed object, in\
    \ the case of a revoked EE certificate)\n   that they have cached.  This would\
    \ cause repository objects (e.g., CA\n   certificates and ROAs) that are verified\
    \ under that certificate to be\n   considered invalid, transitively.  As a result,\
    \ RPs would not\n   consider any ROAs or PATHSEC-protected updates to be valid\
    \ based on\n   these certificates, which would make routes dependent on them less\n\
    \   preferred.  Because a CA that revokes a certificate is authorized to\n   do\
    \ so, this sort of attack cannot be detected, intrinsically, by most\n   RPs.\
    \  However, the entities affected by the revocation or replacement\n   of CA certificates\
    \ can be expected to detect the attack and contact\n   the CA to effect remediation.\
    \  If the CA was not the adversary, it\n   should be able to issue new certificates\
    \ and restore the publication\n   point.\n   An adversary that controls the CA\
    \ for a publication point can publish\n   signed products that create more subtle\
    \ types of DoS attacks against\n   RPs.  For example, such an attacker could create\
    \ subordinate CA\n   certificates with Subject Information Access (SIA) pointers\
    \ that lead\n   RPs on a \"wild goose chase\" looking for additional publication\
    \ points\n   and signed products.  An attacker could publish certificates with\n\
    \   very brief validity intervals or CRLs and manifests that become\n   \"stale\"\
    \ very quickly.  This sort of attack would cause RPs to access\n   repositories\
    \ more frequently, and that might interfere with\n   legitimate accesses by other\
    \ RPs.\n   An attacker with this capability could create very large numbers of\n\
    \   ROAs to be processed (with prefixes that are consistent with the\n   allocation\
    \ for the CA) and correspondingly large manifests.  An\n   attacker could create\
    \ very deep subtrees with many ROAs per\n   publication point, etc.  All of these\
    \ types of DoS attacks against\n   RPs are feasible within the syntactic and semantic\
    \ constraints\n   established for RPKI certificates, CRLs, and signed objects.\n\
    \   An attack that results in revocation and replacement (e.g., key\n   rollover\
    \ or certificate renewal) of a CA certificate would cause RPs\n   to replace the\
    \ old, valid certificate with the new one.  This new\n   certificate might contain\
    \ a public key that does not correspond to\n   the private key held by the certificate\
    \ subject.  That would cause\n   objects signed by that subject to be rejected\
    \ as invalid, and prevent\n   the affected subject from being able to sign new\
    \ objects.  As above,\n   RPs would not consider any ROAs issued under the affected\
    \ CA\n   certificate to be valid, and updates based on router certificates\n \
    \  issued by the affected CA would be rejected.  This would make routes\n   dependent\
    \ on these signed products less preferred.  However, the\n   constraints imposed\
    \ by the use of extensions detailed in [RFC3779]\n   prevent a compromised CA\
    \ from issuing (valid) certificates with INRs\n   outside the scope of the CA,\
    \ thus limiting the impact of the attack.\n   An adversary that controls a CA\
    \ could issue CA certificates with\n   overlapping INRs to different entities\
    \ when no transfer of INRs is\n   intended.  This could cause confusion for RPs\
    \ as conflicting ROAs\n   could be issued by the distinct (subordinate) CAs.\n\
    \   An adversary could replace a CA certificate, use the corresponding\n   private\
    \ key to issue new signed products, and then publish them at a\n   publication\
    \ point controlled by the attacker.  This would effectively\n   transfer the affected\
    \ INRs to the adversary or to a third party of\n   his choosing.  The result would\
    \ be to cause RPs to view the entity\n   that controls the private key in question\
    \ as the legitimate INR\n   holder.  Again, the constraints imposed by the use\
    \ of the extensions\n   in RFC 3779 prevent a compromised CA from issuing (valid)\n\
    \   certificates with INRs outside the scope of the CA, thus limiting the\n  \
    \ impact of the attack.\n   Finally, an entity that manages a repository publication\
    \ point can\n   inadvertently act as an attacker (an example of Walt Kelly's most\n\
    \   famous \"Pogo\" quote [Kelly70]).  For example, a CA might fail to\n   replace\
    \ its own certificate in a timely fashion (well before it\n   expires).  It might\
    \ fail to issue its CRL and manifest prior to\n   expiration, creating stale instances\
    \ of these products that cause\n   concern for RPs.  A CA with many subordinate\
    \ CAs (e.g., an RIR or\n   NIR) might fail to distribute the expiration times\
    \ for the CA\n   certificates that it issues.  A network with many ROAs might\
    \ do the\n   same for the EE certificates associated with the ROAs it generates.\n\
    \   A CA could rollover its key but fail to reissue subordinate CA\n   certificates\
    \ under its new key.  Poor planning with regard to rekey\n   intervals for managed\
    \ CAs could impose undue burdens for RPs, despite\n   a lack of malicious intent.\
    \  All of these examples of mismanagement\n   could adversely affect RPs, despite\
    \ the absence of malicious intent.\n"
- title: 5.  Residual Vulnerabilities
  contents:
  - "5.  Residual Vulnerabilities\n   The RPKI, upon which PATHSEC relies, has several\
    \ residual\n   vulnerabilities that were discussed in the preceding text (Sections\n\
    \   4.4 and 4.5).  These vulnerabilities are of two principle forms:\n   o  The\
    \ RPKI repository system may be attacked in ways that make its\n      contents\
    \ unavailable, not current, or inconsistent.  The principle\n      defense against\
    \ most forms of DoS attacks is the use of a local\n      cache by each RP.  The\
    \ local cache ensures availability of\n      previously acquired RPKI data in\
    \ the event that a repository is\n      inaccessible or if the repository contents\
    \ are deleted\n      (maliciously).  Nonetheless, the system cannot ensure that\
    \ every\n      RP will always have access to up-to-date RPKI data.  An RP, when\n\
    \      it detects a problem with acquired repository data, has two\n      options:\n\
    \      1.  The RP may choose to make use of its local cache, employing\n     \
    \     local configuration settings that tolerate expired or stale\n          objects.\
    \  (Such behavior is, nominally, always within the\n          purview of an RP\
    \ in PKI.)  Using cached, expired, or stale\n          data subjects the RP to\
    \ attacks that take advantage of the\n          RP's ignorance of changes to this\
    \ data.\n      2.  The RP may chose to purge expired objects.  Purging expired\n\
    \          objects removes the security information associated with the\n    \
    \      real-world INRs to which the objects refer.  This is\n          equivalent\
    \ to the affected INRs not having been afforded\n          protection via the\
    \ RPKI.  Since use of the RPKI (and PATHSEC)\n          is voluntary, there may\
    \ always be a set of INRs that are not\n          protected by these mechanisms.\
    \  Thus, purging moves the\n          affected INRs to the set of non-participating\
    \ INR holders.\n          This more conservative response enables an attacker\
    \ to move\n          INRs from the protected set to the unprotected set.\n   o\
    \  Any CA in the RPKI may misbehave within the bounds of the INRs\n      allocated\
    \ to it, e.g., it may issue certificates with duplicate\n      resource allocations\
    \ or revoke certificates inappropriately.  This\n      vulnerability is intrinsic\
    \ in any PKI, but its impact is limited\n      in the RPKI because of the use\
    \ of extensions in RFC 3779.  It is\n      anticipated that RPs will deal with\
    \ such misbehavior through\n      administrative means once it is detected.\n\
    \   PATHSEC has a separate set of residual vulnerabilities:\n   o  It has been\
    \ stated that \"route leaks\" are viewed as a routing\n      security problem\
    \ by many operators.  However, BGP itself does not\n      include semantics that\
    \ preclude what many perceive as route leaks,\n      and there is no definition\
    \ of the term in any RFC.  This makes it\n      inappropriate to address route\
    \ leaks in this document.\n      Additionally, route leaks are outside the scope\
    \ of PATHSEC,\n      consistent with the security context noted in Section 1 of\
    \ this\n      document.  If, at a later time, the SIDR security context is\n \
    \     revised to include route leaks, and an appropriate definition\n      exists,\
    \ this document should be revised.\n   o  PATHSEC is not required to protect all\
    \ attributes associated with\n      an AS_PATH, even though some of these attributes\
    \ may be employed\n      as inputs to routing decisions.  Thus, attacks that modify\
    \ (or\n      strip) these other attributes are not prevented/detected by\n   \
    \   PATHSEC.  As noted in Section 1, the SIDR security context calls\n      for\
    \ protecting only the information needed to verify that a\n      received route\
    \ traversed the ASes in question, and that the NLRI\n      in the route is what\
    \ was advertised.  (The AS_PATH data also may\n      have traversed ASes within\
    \ a confederation that are not\n      represented.  However, these ASes are not\
    \ externally visible and\n      thus do not influence route selection, so their\
    \ omission in this\n      context is not a security concern.)  Thus, protection\
    \ of other\n      attributes is outside the scope of this document, as described\
    \ in\n      Section 1.  If, at a later time, the SIDR security context is\n  \
    \    revised to include protection of additional BGP attributes, this\n      document\
    \ should be revised.\n   o  PATHSEC cannot ensure that an AS will withdraw a route\
    \ when the AS\n      no longer has a route for a prefix, as noted in Section 4.2.\n\
    \      PATHSEC may incorporate features to limit the lifetime of an\n      advertisement.\
    \  Such lifetime limits provide an upper bound on the\n      time that the failure\
    \ to withdraw a route will remain effective.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   A threat model is, by definition, a security-centric\
    \ document.\n   Unlike a protocol description, a threat model does not create\n\
    \   security problems nor does it purport to address security problems.\n   This\
    \ model postulates a set of threats (i.e., motivated, capable\n   adversaries)\
    \ and examines classes of attacks that these threats are\n   capable of effecting,\
    \ based on the motivations ascribed to the\n   threats.  It describes the impact\
    \ of these types of attacks on\n   PATHSEC, including the RPKI on which PATHSEC\
    \ relies.  It describes\n   how the design of the RPKI (and the PATHSEC design\
    \ goals) address\n   classes of attacks, where applicable.  It also notes residual\n\
    \   vulnerabilities.\n"
