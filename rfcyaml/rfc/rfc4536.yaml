    \ 2.1\n   of the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL 1.0, SMIL\n\
    \   2.0, SMIL 2.1).  SMIL allows integration of a set of independent\n   multimedia\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has issued specifications\
    \ that\n   define versions 1.0 [1], 2.0 [2] and 2.1 [3] of the Synchronized\n\
    \   Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL).  This memo provides\n   information\
    \ about the application/smil and application/smil+xml media\n   types.\n   The\
    \ definition is based on RFC 3023, which defines the use of the\n   \"application/xml\"\
    \ media type [4].  Before using the\n   \"application/smil\" or \"application/smil+xml\"\
    \ media type, implementors\n   must thus be familiar with [4].\n"

    \  Using SMIL, an author can\n   1. describe the temporal behavior of the presentation,\n\

- title: 4.  Recognizing SMIL Files
  contents:
  - "4.  Recognizing SMIL Files\n   All SMIL files will have the string \"<smil\"\
    \ near the beginning of the\n   file.  Some will also begin with an XML declaration\
    \ that begins with\n   \"<?xml\", though that alone does not indicate a SMIL document.\n\
    \   All SMIL 2.0 files must include a declaration of the SMIL 2.0\n   namespace.\
    \  This should appear shortly after the string \"<smil\", and\n   should read\
    \ 'xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/SMIL20/Language\"'.\n   All SMIL 2.1 files must\
    \ include a declaration of a SMIL 2.1\n   namespace, appearing shortly after the\
    \ string \"<smil\".  The namespace\n   string depends on the language profile.\
    \  Please refer to the SMIL 2.1\n   specification for the definition of the relevant\
    \ namespace names.\n"
- title: 5.  The "profile" Optional Parameter
  contents:
  - "5.  The \"profile\" Optional Parameter\n   This parameter is meant to be used\
    \ in MIME media-type-based content\n   negotiation (such as that done with the\
    \ HTTP \"Accept\" header) to\n   negotiate for a variety of SMIL-based languages.\
    \  It is modelled\n   after the \"profile\" parameter in the application/xhtml+xml\
    \ MIME type\n   registration [5] and is motivated by very similar considerations.\n\
    \   The parameter is intended to be used only during content negotiation.\n  \
    \ It is not expected that it be used to deliver content, or that origin\n   web\
    \ servers have any knowledge of it (though they are welcome to).\n   It is primarily\
    \ targeted for use on the network by proxies in the\n   HTTP chain that manipulate\
    \ data formats (such as transcoders).\n   The value of the profile attribute is\
    \ a URI that can be used as a\n   name to identify a language.  Though the URI\
    \ need not be resolved in\n   order to be useful as a name, it could be a namespace,\
    \ schema, or\n   language specification.\n   For example, user agents supporting\
    \ only SMIL Basic (see\n   http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/smil-basic.html) currently\
    \ have no\n   standard means to convey their inability to fully support SMIL 2.0.\n\
    \   While SMIL 2.0 Basic user agents are required to parse the full SMIL\n   2.0\
    \ language, there is potentially a substantial burden in receiving\n   and parsing\
    \ document content that will not be presented to the user,\n   since its functionality\
    \ is not included in SMIL Basic.\n   In the future, the functionality afforded\
    \ by this parameter will also\n   be achievable by the emerging work on a protocol\
    \ to transfer\n   Composite Capability/Preferences Profiles (CC/PP) descriptions\
    \ [6].\n   It is suggested that the \"profile\" parameter be used until the CC/PP\n\
    \   protocol work has been finalized.\n   An example use of this parameter as\
    \ part of a HTTP GET transaction\n   would be:\n        Accept: application/smil+xml;\n\
    \           profile=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/SMIL20/HostLanguage\"\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   SMIL documents contain a construct that allows\
    \ \"infinite loops\".\n   This is indispensable for a multimedia format.  However,\
    \ SMIL clients\n   should foresee provisions such as a \"stop\" button that lets\
    \ users\n   interrupt such an \"infinite loop\".\n   As with HTML, SMIL documents\
    \ contain links to other media (images,\n   sounds, videos, text, etc.), and those\
    \ links are typically followed\n   automatically by software, resulting in the\
    \ transfer of files without\n   the explicit request of the user for each one.\
    \  The security\n   considerations of each linked file are those of the individual\n\
    \   registered types.\n   The SMIL language contains \"switch\" elements.  SMIL\
    \ provides no\n   mechanism that ensures that the media objects contained in a\
    \ \"switch\"\n   element provide equivalent information.  An author knowing that\
    \ one\n   SMIL player will display one alternative of a \"switch\" and another\n\
    \   will display a different part can put different information in the\n   two\
    \ parts.  While there are legitimate use cases for this, it also\n   gives rise\
    \ to a security consideration: The author can fool viewers\n   into thinking that\
    \ the same information was displayed when in fact it\n   was not.\n   In addition,\
    \ all of the security considerations of RFC 3023 also\n   apply to SMIL.\n"
