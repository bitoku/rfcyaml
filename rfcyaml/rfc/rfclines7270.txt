Abstract This document describes some additional IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Information Elements in the range of 1 127, which is the range compatible with field types used by NetFlow version 9 in RFC 3954, as specified in the IPFIX Information Model in RFC 7012.
Introduction Section 4 of [RFC7012] defines the IPFIX Information Elements (IEs) in the range of 1 127 to be compatible with the NetFlow version 9 fields, as specified in "Cisco Systems NetFlow Services Export Version 9" [RFC3954].
As [RFC3954] was published in 2004, it does not contain all NetFlow version 9 field types in the range of 1 127.
The question was asked whether IPFIX Devices should exclusively report the IANA IPFIX IEs [IANA IPFIX].
In other words, when upgrading from a NetFlow Metering Process to an IPFIX Metering Process, should the IPFIX Devices stop reporting IEs specific to NetFlow version 9 that were not registered in IANA [IANA IPFIX]?
This document is intended to fill the gap in this IE range.
It describes some additional IPFIX Information Elements in the range of 1 127, which is the range compatible with field types used by NetFlow version 9 in [RFC3954], as specified in the IPFIX Information Model [RFC7012].
With this, IPFIX implementations could export all the Information Elements specified in IANA [IANA IPFIX], regardless of the range.
This document follows the rules in "Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers of IP Flow Export (IPFIX) Information Elements" [RFC7013].
This document does not extend [RFC3954].
The IPFIX Protocol [RFC7011] has its own Information Model ([RFC7012] and IANA [IANA IPFIX]), which is extensible upon application to IANA, subject to expert review by IE DOCTORS [RFC7013].
This document extends the IPFIX Information Model.
Terminology IPFIX specific terminology used in this document is defined in Section 2 of [RFC7011].
As in [RFC7011], these IPFIX specific terms have the first letter of a word capitalized when used in this document.
The following Information Elements are discussed in the sections below:
Deprecated in favor of 305 samplingPacketInterval.
When using sampled NetFlow, the rate at which packets are sampled   e.g., a value of 100 indicates that one of every 100 packets is sampled.
34 Semantics:  quantity Status:  deprecated Units:  packets 4.2.
Deprecated in favor of 304 selectorAlgorithm.
The type of algorithm used for sampled NetFlow: 1 Deterministic Sampling, 2 Random Sampling.
The values are not compatible with the selectorAlgorithm IE, where "Deterministic" has been replaced by "Systematic count based" (1) or "Systematic time based" (2), and "Random" is (3).
Conversion is required; see "Packet Sampling (PSAMP) Parameters" [IANA PSAMP].

Abstract Data Type:  octetArray ElementId:
65 .. 69 Performance metrics will need a consolidation in the industry, based on [RFC6390].
Once this consolidation happens, via a separate document the IEs 65 69 will either be assigned in the IANA registry or their status will be deprecated.
IEs Assigned for NetFlow v9 Compatibility ElementId: 105..127
These element IDs are not covered by this document and are left "as is", i.e., for NetFlow v9 compatibility.
This document specifies several new IPFIX Information Elements in IANA's "IPFIX Information Elements" registry [IANA IPFIX] as summarized in Section 3 and detailed in Section 4 above.
The following Information Elements have been assigned:  IE Number 34 for the samplingInterval IE  IE Number 35 for the samplingAlgorithm IE  IE Number 38 for the engineType IE  IE Number 39 for the engineId IE  IE Number 43 for the ipv4RouterSc IE  IE Number 48 for the samplerId IE  IE Number 49 for the samplerMode IE  IE Number 50 for the samplerRandomInterval IE
IE Number 51 for the classId IE  IE Number 84 for the samplerName IE  IE Number 87 for the flagsAndSamplerId IE  IE Number 89 for the forwardingStatus IE  IE Number 92 for the srcTrafficIndex IE  IE Number 93 for the dstTrafficIndex IE  IE Number 100 for the className IE  IE Number 102 for the layer2packetSectionOffset IE  IE Number 103 for the layer2packetSectionSize IE  IE Number 104 for the layer2packetSectionData IE 7.
