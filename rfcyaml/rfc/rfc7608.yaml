- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   IPv6 prefix length, as in IPv4, is a parameter conveyed and used\
    \ in\n   IPv6 routing and forwarding processes in accordance with the\n   Classless\
    \ Inter-domain Routing (CIDR) architecture.  The length of an\n   IPv6 prefix\
    \ may be any number from zero to 128, although subnets\n   using stateless address\
    \ autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for address\n   allocation conventionally use a /64\
    \ prefix.  Hardware and software\n   implementations of routing and forwarding\
    \ should therefore impose no\n   rules on prefix length, but implement longest-match-first\
    \ on prefixes\n   of any valid length.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Discussions on the 64-bit boundary in IPv6 addressing ([RFC7421])\n\
    \   revealed a need for a clear recommendation on which bits must be used\n  \
    \ by forwarding decision-making processes.  However, such a\n   recommendation\
    \ was out of scope for that document.\n   Although Section 2.5 of [RFC4291] states\
    \ \"IPv6 unicast addresses are\n   aggregatable with prefixes of arbitrary bit-length,\
    \ similar to IPv4\n   addresses under Classless Inter-Domain Routing\" (CIDR,\
    \ [RFC4632]),\n   there is still a misinterpretation that IPv6 prefixes can be\
    \ either\n   /127 ([RFC6164]) or any length up to /64.  This misinterpretation\
    \ is\n   mainly induced by the 64-bit boundary in IPv6 addressing.\n   As discussed\
    \ in [RFC7421], \"the notion of a /64 boundary in the\n   address was introduced\
    \ after the initial design of IPv6, following a\n   period when it was expected\
    \ to be at /80\".  This evolution of the\n   IPv6 addressing architecture, resulting\
    \ in [RFC4291], and followed\n   with the addition of /127 prefixes for point-to-point\
    \ links, clearly\n   demonstrates the intent for future IPv6 developments to have\
    \ the\n   flexibility to change this part of the architecture when justified.\n\
    \   It is fundamental not to link routing and forwarding to the IPv6\n   prefix/address\
    \ semantics [RFC4291].  This document includes a\n   recommendation in order to\
    \ support that goal.\n   Forwarding decisions rely on the longest-match-first\
    \ algorithm, which\n   stipulates that, given a choice between two prefixes in\
    \ the\n   Forwarding Information Base (FIB) of different length that match the\n\
    \   destination address in each bit up to their respective lengths, the\n   longer\
    \ prefix is used.  This document's recommendation (Section 2) is\n   that IPv6\
    \ forwarding must follow the longest-match-first rule,\n   regardless of prefix\
    \ length, unless some overriding policy is\n   configured.\n   This recommendation\
    \ does not conflict with the 64-bit boundary for\n   some schemes that based on\
    \ IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration\n   (SLAAC) [RFC4862], such as [RFC2464].\
    \  Indeed, [RFC7421] clarifies\n   this is only a parameter in the SLAAC process,\
    \ and other longer\n   prefix lengths are in operational use (e.g., either manually\n\
    \   configured or based upon DHCPv6 [RFC3315]).\n   A historical background of\
    \ CIDR is documented in [RFC1380] and\n   Section 2 of [RFC4632].\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\

- title: 2.  Recommendation
  contents:
  - "2.  Recommendation\n   IPv6 implementations MUST conform to the rules specified\
    \ in\n   Section 5.1 of [RFC4632].\n   Decision-making processes for forwarding\
    \ MUST NOT restrict the length\n   of IPv6 prefixes by design.  In particular,\
    \ forwarding processes MUST\n   be designed to process prefixes of any length\
    \ up to /128, by\n   increments of 1.\n   Policies can be enforced to restrict\
    \ the length of IP prefixes\n   advertised within a given domain or in a given\
    \ interconnection link.\n   These policies are deployment specific and/or driven\
    \ by\n   administrative (interconnection) considerations.\n"
