  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies how Simple Network Management Protocol
    (SNMP)\n   messages can be transmitted directly over IEEE 802 networks.  For a\n
    \  detailed overview of the documents that describe the Internet-\n   Standard
    management framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410\n   [RFC3410].  This
    document supplements the standard SNMP transport\n   mappings defined in RFC 3417
    [RFC3417].\n   This document obsoletes RFC 1089.\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "3.  SNMP over IEEE 802 Networks\n   This is an optional transport mapping.  The
    need to carry SNMP\n   directly over an 802 LAN transport in order to allow for
    the\n   management of simple devices was identified in applications like the\n
    \  Two-Port Media Access Control (MAC) Relay, which is being developed\n   in
    IEEE 802.1 as project P802.1aj [802.1aj].\n   SNMP over IEEE 802 networks has
    some inherent restrictions.  Using\n   the SNMP over IEEE 802 transport mapping
    restricts messages to a\n   single logical IEEE 802 LAN, bridged LAN or VLAN.
    \ Furthermore, only\n   a single SNMP engine can be addressed on a given IEEE
    802 network\n   interface.  In particular, command generators and notification\n
    \  receivers, as well as command responders and notification\n   originators,
    must share a single transport endpoint.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Serialization\n   SNMP messages are serialized, as described in Section
      8 of RFC 3417\n   [RFC3417].  The resulting serialized message is shipped in
      the data\n   portion of an IEEE LAN MAC frame.\n"
    title: 3.1.  Serialization
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Well-known Values\n   Serialized SNMP messages are sent in IEEE 802.3
      frames with an\n   Ethernet type field of 33100 (hexadecimal 814C).\n   When
      serialized SNMP messages are sent in IEEE 802.3 frames (and in\n   other IEEE
      802 MAC frame types that can natively represent Ethernet\n   type values), an
      Ethernet type field value of 33100 (hexadecimal\n   814C) MUST be used as the
      link layer protocol identifier.  In IEEE\n   802 LANs that use LLC as the means
      of link layer protocol\n   identification, such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs,
      the SNAP\n   encapsulation method described in subclause 10.5 \"Encapsulation
      of\n   Ethernet frames over LLC\" in [IEEE802] MUST be used.\n   When an SNMP
      entity uses this transport mapping, it MUST be capable\n   of accepting SNMP
      messages up to and including 484 octets in size.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that
      implementations be capable of accepting\n   messages of up to 1472 octets in
      size.  Implementation of larger\n   values is encouraged whenever possible.\n"

  title: 3.  SNMP over IEEE 802 Networks
- contents:
  - "4.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules\n   Several core SNMP MIB modules use TDomain/TAddress
    pairs to identify\n   SNMP transport endpoints.  The SNMP-TARGET-MIB [RFC3413]
    uses\n   TDomain/TAddress pairs to identify targets that can be used as\n   notification
    receivers.  TDomain/TAddress pairs are used by the\n   NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB [RFC3014]
    to record the source from which a\n   notification was received.  The ENTITY-MIB
    [RFC4133] uses TDomain/\n   TAddress pairs to provide the transport endpoint of
    logical entities.\n   The MIB module contained in this document introduces the
    object\n   identifier constant snmpIeee802Domain.  This constant can be assigned\n
    \  to an object of type TDomain to identify an SNMP over IEEE 802\n   endpoint,
    in which case the corresponding TAddress will have a value\n   that conforms to
    the MacAddress textual convention.  By providing\n   these definitions, it is
    possible to use the generic MIB modules to\n   refer to SNMP over IEEE 802 endpoints.\n"

    branch for the\n   SNMP-IEEE802-TM-MIB module.\n   IANA assigned an OID value
    below snmpDomains for the transport\n   domain.  This first required the setup

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This module does not define any management objects.
    \ Instead, it\n   defines an OBJECT-IDENTIFIER which may be used by other MIB
    modules\n   to identify an SNMP transport mapping.  Meaningful security\n   considerations
    can only be written in the MIB modules that define\n   management objects.  The
    MIB module in this document has therefore no\n   impact on the security of the
    Internet.\n   SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c messages are not considered secure.  It is\n
    \  recommended that the implementors consider the use of SNMPv3 messages\n   and
    the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.\n   Specifically, the
    use of the User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC\n   3414 [RFC3414] and the View-based
    Access Control Model STD 62, RFC\n   3415 [RFC3415] is recommended.\n   It is
    then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving
    access to a MIB is properly configured to give access\n   to the objects only
    to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET
    (change) them.\n"

    by Marty\n   Schoffstall, Chuck Davin, Mark Fedor, and Jeff Case, and published
    as\n   RFC 1089 [RFC1089].\n   Bert Wijnen and Dan Romascanu provided guidance
    on many aspects of\n   this revised specification.  David Harrington provided
