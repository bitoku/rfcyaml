  - "1 Introduction\n   This document defines four new Job Description attributes\
    \ for\n   monitoring job progress to be registered as OPTIONAL extensions to\n\
    \   IPP/1.0 [RFC2566] and IPP/1.1 [RFC2911].  These attributes are drawn\n   from\
    \ the PWG Job Monitoring MIB [RFC2707].  See section 10 for a\n   description\
    \ of the base IPP documents.  The new Job Description\n   attributes are:\n  \
    \    \"job-collation-type\" (type2 enum)\n      \"sheet-completed-copy-number\"\
    \ (integer(0:MAX))\n      \"sheet-completed-document-number\" (integer(0:MAX))\n\
    \      \"impressions-completed-current-copy\" (integer(0:MAX))\n   This document\
    \ also defines a new \"sheet-collate\" Job Template\n   attribute to control sheet\
    \ collation and to help with the\n   interpretation of the job progress attributes.\
    \  These new attributes\n   may also be used by themselves in combination with\
    \ the IPP/1.1 \"job-\n   impressions-completed\" attribute, as useful job progress\
    \ monitoring\n   attributes and/or may be passed in an IPP Notification (see [ipp-\n\
    \   ntfy]).\n"

    \   This attribute specifies whether or not the media sheets of each copy\n  \
    \ of each printed document in a job are to be in sequence, when\n   multiple copies\
    \ of the document are specified by the 'copies'\n   attribute.\n   Standard keyword\
    \ values are:\n      'uncollated':  each print-stream sheet is printed a number\
    \ of\n         times in succession equal to the value of the 'copies'\n      \
    \   attribute, followed by the next print-stream sheet.\n      'collated':  each\
    \ copy of each document is printed with the\n         print-stream sheets in sequence,\
    \ followed by the next document\n         copy.\n   For example, suppose a document\
    \ produces two media sheets as output,\n   and \"copies\" is equal to '6'.  For\
    \ the 'uncollated' case, six copies\n   of the first media sheet are printed,\
    \ followed by six copies of the\n   second media sheet.  For the 'collated' case,\
    \ one copy of each of the\n   six sheets is printed, followed by another copy\
    \ of each of the six\n   media sheets.\n   Whether the effect of sheet collation\
    \ is achieved by placing copies\n   of a document in multiple output bins, or\
    \ in the same output bin with\n   implementation defined document separation,\
    \ is implementation\n   dependent.  Also whether it is achieved by making multiple\
    \ passes\n   over the job or by using an output sorter, is implementation\n  \
    \ dependent.\n   Note: IPP/1.0 [RFC2566] and IPP/1.1 [RFC2911] are silent on whether\n\
    \   or not sheets within documents are collated.  The \"sheet-collate-\n   supported\"\
    \ Printer attribute permits a Printer object to indicate\n   whether or not it\
    \ collates sheets with each document and whether it\n   allows the client to control\
    \ sheet collation.  An implementation is\n   able to indicate that it supports\
    \ uncollated sheets, collated sheets,\n   or both, using the 'uncollated', 'collated',\
    \ or both 'uncollated' and\n   'collated' values, respectively.\n   This attribute\
    \ is affected by \"multiple-document-handling\".  The\n   \"multiple-document-handling\"\
    \ attribute describes the collation of\n   documents, and the \"sheet-collate\"\
    \ attribute describes the semantics\n   of collating individual pages within a\
    \ document.  To better explain\n   the interaction between these two attributes,\
    \ the term \"set\" is\n   introduced.  A \"set\" is a logical boundary between\
    \ the delivered\n   media sheets of a printed job.  For example, in the case of\
    \ a ten\n   page single document with collated pages and a request for 50 copies,\n\
    \   each of the 50 printed copies of the document constitutes a \"set\".\n   In\
    \ the above example if the pages were uncollated, then 50 copies of\n   each of\
    \ the individual pages within the document would represent each\n   \"set\".\n\
    \   The following table describes the interaction of \"sheet-collate\" with\n\
    \   multiple document handling.\n      \"sheet-        \"multiple-       Semantics\n\
    \      collate\"       document-\n                     handling\"\n      'collated'\

- title: 4 IPP Job Description attributes for monitoring Job Progress
  contents:
  - "4 IPP Job Description attributes for monitoring Job Progress\n   The following\
    \ IPP Job Description attributes are proposed to be added\n   to IPP through the\
    \ type2 registration procedures.  They are useful\n   for monitoring the progress\
    \ of a job.  They are also used as\n   attributes in the notification content\
    \ in a notification report\n   [ipp-ntfy].\n   There are a number of Job Description\
    \ attributes for monitoring the\n   progress of a job.  These objects and attributes\
    \ count the number of\n   K octets, impressions, sheets, and pages requested or\
    \ completed.  For\n   impressions and sheets, \"completed\" means stacked, unless\
    \ the\n   implementation is unable to detect when each sheet is stacked, in\n\
    \   which case, stacked is approximated when the processing of each sheet\n  \
    \ is completed.  There are objects and attributes for the overall job\n   and\
    \ for the current copy of the document currently being stacked.\n   For the latter,\
    \ the rate at which the various objects and attributes\n   count, depends on the\
    \ sheet and document collation of the job.\n   Consider the following four Job\
    \ Description attributes that are used\n   to monitor the progress of a job's\
    \ impressions:\n      1. \"job-impressions-completed\" - counts the total number\
    \ of\n         impressions stacked for the job (see [RFC2911] section\n      \
    \   4.3.18.2).\n      2. \"impressions-completed-current-copy\" - counts the number\
    \ of\n         impressions stacked for the current document copy.\n      3. \"\
    sheet-completed-copy-number\" - identifies the number of the\n         copy for\
    \ the current document being stacked, where the first\n         copy is 1.\n \
    \     4. \"sheet-completed-document-number\" - identifies the current\n      \
    \   document within the job that is being stacked, where the first\n         document\
    \ in a job is 1.  NOTE: this attribute SHOULD NOT be\n         implemented for\
    \ implementations that only support one document\n         per job.\n   For each\
    \ of the three types of job collation, a job with three copies\n   of two documents\
    \ (1, 2), where each document consists of 3\n   impressions, the four variables\
    \ have the following values, as each\n   sheet is stacked for one-sided printing:\n\
    \   \"job-collation-type\" = 'uncollated-sheets(3)'\n   \"job-            \"impressions-\

  - "4.1 job-collation-type (type2 enum)\n   Job Collation includes sheet collation\

    \ ordering of document\n   copies within a multi-document job.  The value of the\
    \ \"job-\n   collation-type\" is affected by the value of the \"sheet-collate\"\

    \  Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer's Guide [RFC3196]\n      Mapping\
    \ between LPD and IPP Protocols [RFC2569]\n   The \"Design Goals for an Internet\
    \ Printing Protocol\" document takes a\n   broad look at distributed printing\
    \ functionality, and enumerates\n   real-life scenarios that help to clarify the\
    \ features that need to be\n   included in a printing protocol for the Internet.\
    \  It identifies\n   requirements for three types of users: end users, operators,\
    \ and\n   administrators.  It calls out a subset of end user requirements that\n\
    \   are satisfied in IPP/1.0 [RFC2566, RFC2565].  A few OPTIONAL operator\n  \
    \ operations have been added to IPP/1.1 [RFC2911, RFC2910].\n   The \"Rationale\
    \ for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the\n   Internet Printing Protocol\"\
    \ document describes IPP from a high level\n   view, defines a roadmap for the\
    \ various documents that form the suite\n   of IPP specification documents, and\
    \ gives background and rationale\n   for the IETF IPP working group's major decisions.\n\
    \   The \"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics\" document\n   describes\
    \ a simplified model with abstract objects, their attributes,\n   and their operations.\
    \  The model introduces a Printer and a Job.  The\n   Job supports multiple documents\
    \ per Job.  The model document also\n   addresses how security, internationalization,\
    \ and directory issues\n   are addressed.\n   The \"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1:\
    \ Encoding and Transport\" document\n   is a formal mapping of the abstract operations\
    \ and attributes defined\n   in the model document onto HTTP/1.1 [RFC2616].  It\
    \ also defines the\n   encoding rules for a new Internet MIME media type called\n\
    \   \"application/ipp\".  This document also defines the rules for\n   transporting\
    \ over HTTP a message body whose Content-Type is\n   \"application/ipp\".  This\
    \ document defines the 'ipp' scheme for\n   identifying IPP printers and jobs.\n\
    \   The \"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer's Guide\" document\n   gives\
    \ insight and advice to implementers of IPP clients and IPP\n   objects.  It is\
    \ intended to help them understand IPP/1.1 and some of\n   the considerations\
    \ that may assist them in the design of their client\n   and/or IPP object implementations.\
    \  For example, a typical order of\n   processing requests is given, including\
    \ error checking.  Motivation\n   for some of the specification decisions is also\
    \ included.\n   The \"Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols\" document gives some\n\
    \   advice to implementers of gateways between IPP and LPD (Line Printer\n   Daemon)\
    \ implementations.\n   In addition to the base IPP documents, the \"Event Notification\n\
    \   Specification\" document [ipp-ntfy] defines OPTIONAL operations that\n   allow\
    \ a client to subscribe to printing related events.\n   Subscriptions include\
    \ \"Per-Job subscriptions\" and \"Per-Printer\n   subscriptions\".  Subscriptions\
    \ are modeled as Subscription objects.\n   Four other operations are defined for\
    \ subscription objects:  get\n   attributes, get subscriptions, renew a subscription,\
    \ and cancel a\n   subscription.\n"
