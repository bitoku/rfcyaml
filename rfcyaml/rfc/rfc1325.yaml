  - "1. Introduction\n   New users joining the Internet community have the same questions\
    \ as\n   did everyone else who has ever joined.  Our quest is to provide the\n\
    \   Internet community with up to date, basic Internet knowledge and\n   experience,\
    \ while moving the redundancies away from the electronic\n   mailing lists so\
    \ that the lists' subscribers do not have to read the\n   same queries and answers\
    \ over and over again.\n   Future updates of this memo will be produced as User\
    \ Services members\n   become aware of additional questions that should be included,\
    \ and of\n   deficiencies or inaccuracies that should be amended in this document.\n\

- title: 3. Questions About the Internet
  contents:
  - "3. Questions About the Internet\n   What is the Internet?\n      The Internet\
    \ is a large collection of networks (all of which run\n      the TCP/IP protocols)\
    \ that are tied together so that users of any\n      of the networks can use the\
    \ network services provided by TCP/IP to\n      reach users on any of the other\
    \ networks.  The Internet started\n      with the ARPANET, but now includes such\
    \ networks as NSFNET,\n      NYSERnet, and thousands of others.  There are other\
    \ major wide\n      area networks, such as BITNET and DECnet networks, that are\
    \ not\n      based on the TCP/IP protocols and are thus not part of the\n    \
    \  Internet.  However, it is possible to communicate between them and\n      the\
    \ Internet via electronic mail because of mail gateways that act\n      as \"\
    translators\" between the different network protocols involved.\n      Note: You\
    \ will often see \"internet\" with a small \"i\".  This could\n      refer to\
    \ any network built based on TCP/IP, or might refer to\n      networks using other\
    \ protocol families that are composites built\n      of smaller networks.\n  \
    \ I just got on the Internet.  What can I do now?\n      You now have access to\
    \ all the resources you are authorized to use\n      on your own Internet host,\
    \ on any other Internet host on which you\n      have an account, and on any other\
    \ Internet host that offers\n      publicly accessible information.  The Internet\
    \ gives you the\n      ability to move information between these hosts via file\n\
    \      transfers.  Once you are logged into one host, you can use the\n      Internet\
    \ to open a connection to another, login, and use its\n      services interactively\
    \ (this is known as remote login or\n      \"TELNETing\".  In addition, you can\
    \ send electronic mail to users\n      at any Internet site and to users on many\
    \ non-Internet sites that\n      are accessible via electronic mail.\n      There\
    \ are various other services you can use.  For example, some\n      hosts provide\
    \ access to specialized databases or to archives of\n      information.  The Internet\
    \ Resource Guide provides information\n      regarding some of these sites.  The\
    \ Internet Resource Guide lists\n      facilities on the Internet that are available\
    \ to users.  Such\n      facilities include supercomputer centers, library catalogs\
    \ and\n      specialized data collections.  The guide is published by the NSF\n\
    \      Network Service Center (NNSC) and is continuously being updated.\n    \
    \  The Resource Guide is distributed free via e-mail (send a note to\n      resource-guide-request@nnsc.nsf.net\
    \ to join the e-mail\n      distribution) and via anonymous FTP (in nnsc.nsf.net:resource-\n\
    \      guide/*).  Hardcopy is available at a nominal fee (to cover\n      reproduction\
    \ costs) from the NNSC.  Call the NNSC at 617-873-3400\n      for more information.\n\
    \   How do I find out if a site has a computer on the Internet?\n      Three good\
    \ sources to consult are \"!%@:: A Directory of Electronic\n      Mail Addressing\
    \ and Networks\" by Donnalyn Frey and Rick Adams;\n      \"The User's Directory\
    \ of Computer Networks\", by Tracy LaQuey; and\n      \"The Matrix: Computer Networks\
    \ and Conferencing Systems\n      Worldwide\", by John Quarterman.\n      In addition,\
    \ it is possible to find some information about\n      Internet sites in the WHOIS\
    \ database maintained at the DDN NIC at\n      Network Solutions, Inc..  The DDN\
    \ NIC (Defense Data Network,\n      Network Information Center) provides an information\
    \ retrieval\n      interface to the database that is also called WHOIS.  To use\
    \ this\n      interface, TELNET to NIC.DDN.MIL and type \"whois\" (carriage\n\
    \      return).  No login is necessary.  Type \"help\" at the whois prompt\n \
    \     for more information on using the facility.  WHOIS will show many\n    \
    \  sites, but may not show every site registered with the DDN NIC\n      (simply\
    \ for reasons having to do with how the program is set up to\n      search the\
    \ database).\n   How do I get a list of all the hosts on the Internet?\n     \
    \ You really don't want that.  The list includes almost 727,000\n      hosts.\
    \  Almost all of them require that you have access permission\n      to actually\
    \ use them.  However, there are many machines which\n      serve special functions\
    \ and are available to the public.  There is\n      not yet a definitive list,\
    \ but below are some available machines.\n      They are available via telnet.\n\
    \         A geographic information server which provides latitude,\n         longitude\
    \ and other statistics about a city.\n            telnet martini.eecs.umich.edu\
    \ 3000\n         The Library of Congress maintains an online catalog.\n      \
    \      telnet dra.com\n         NASA SpaceLink offers latest NASA news including\
    \ shuttle\n         launches and satellite updates.\n            telnet spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov\n"
- title: 4. Questions About TCP/IP
  contents:
  - "4. Questions About TCP/IP\n   What is TCP/IP?\n      TCP/IP (Transmission Control\
    \ Protocol/Internet Protocol) [4,5,6]\n      is the common name for a family of\
    \ over 100 data-communications\n      protocols used to organize computers and\
    \ data-communications\n      equipment into computer networks.  TCP/IP was developed\
    \ to\n      interconnect hosts on ARPANET, PRNET (packet radio), and SATNET\n\
    \      (packet satellite).  All three of these networks have since been\n    \
    \  retired; but TCP/IP lives on.  It is currently used on a large\n      international\
    \ network of networks called the Internet, whose\n      members include universities,\
    \ other research institutions,\n      government facilities, and many corporations.\
    \  TCP/IP is also\n      sometimes used for other networks, particularly local\
    \ area\n      networks that tie together numerous different kinds of computers\n\
    \      or tie together engineering workstations.\n   What are the other well-known\
    \ standard protocols\n   in the TCP/IP family?\n      Other than TCP and IP, the\
    \ three main protocols in the TCP/IP\n      suite are the Simple Mail Transfer\
    \ Protocol (SMTP) [8], the File\n      Transfer Protocol (FTP) [3], and the TELNET\
    \ Protocol [9].  There\n      are many other protocols in use on the Internet.\
    \  The Internet\n      Activities Board (IAB) regularly publishes an RFC [2] that\n\
    \      describes the state of standardization of the various Internet\n      protocols.\
    \  This document is the best guide to the current status\n      of Internet protocols\
    \ and their recommended usage.\n"
- title: 5.  Questions About the Domain Name System
  contents:
  - "5.  Questions About the Domain Name System\n   What is the Domain Name System?\n\
    \      The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical, distributed method\n  \
    \    of organizing the name space of the Internet.  The DNS\n      administratively\
    \ groups hosts into a hierarchy of authority that\n      allows addressing and\
    \ other information to be widely distributed\n      and maintained.  A big advantage\
    \ to the DNS is that using it\n      eliminates dependence on a centrally-maintained\
    \ file that maps\n      host names to addresses.\n   What is a Fully Qualified\
    \ Domain Name?\n      A Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) is a domain name that\n\
    \      includes all higher level domains relevant to the entity named.\n     \
    \ If you think of the DNS as a tree-structure with each node having\n      its\
    \ own label, a Fully Qualified Domain Name for a specific node\n      would be\
    \ its label followed by the labels of all the other nodes\n      between it and\
    \ the root of the tree.  For example, for a host, a\n      FQDN would include\
    \ the string that identifies the particular host,\n      plus all domains of which\
    \ the host is a part up to and including\n      the top-level domain (the root\
    \ domain is always null).  For\n      example, PARIS.NISC.SRI.COM is a Fully Qualified\
    \ Domain Name for\n      the host at 192.33.33.109.  In addition, NISC.SRI.COM\
    \ is the FQDN\n      for the NISC domain.\n"
- title: 6. Questions About Internet Documentation
  contents:
  - "6. Questions About Internet Documentation\n   What is an RFC?\n      The Request\
    \ for Comments documents (RFCs) are working notes of the\n      Internet research\
    \ and development community.  A document in this\n      series may be on essentially\
    \ any topic related to computer\n      communication, and may be anything from\
    \ a meeting report to the\n      specification of a standard.  Submissions for\
    \ Requests for\n      Comments may be sent to the RFC Editor (RFC-EDITOR@ISI.EDU).\
    \  The\n      RFC Editor is Jon Postel.\n      Most RFCs are the descriptions\
    \ of network protocols or services,\n      often giving detailed procedures and\
    \ formats for their\n      implementation.  Other RFCs report on the results of\
    \ policy\n      studies or summarize the work of technical committees or\n   \
    \   workshops.  All RFCs are considered public domain unless\n      explicitly\
    \ marked otherwise.\n      While RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive\n\
    \      technical review from either the task forces, individual technical\n  \
    \    experts, or the RFC Editor, as appropriate.  Currently, most\n      standards\
    \ are published as RFCs, but not all RFCs specify\n      standards.\n      Anyone\
    \ can submit a document for publication as an RFC.\n      Submissions must be\
    \ made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor.\n      Please consult RFC 1111,\
    \ \"Instructions to RFC Authors\" [10], for\n      further information.  RFCs\
    \ are accessible online in public access\n      files, and a short message is\
    \ sent to a notification distribution\n      list indicating the availability\
    \ of the memo.  Requests to be\n      added to this distribution list should be\
    \ sent to RFC-\n      REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.\n      The online files are copied\
    \ by interested people and printed or\n      displayed at their sites on their\
    \ equipment.  (An RFC may also be\n      returned via electronic mail in response\
    \ to an electronic mail\n      query.) This means that the format of the online\
    \ files must meet\n      the constraints of a wide variety of printing and display\n\
    \      equipment.\n      Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published,\
    \ that RFC\n      is never revised or re-issued with the same number.  There is\n\
    \      never a question of having the most recent version of a particular\n  \
    \    RFC.  However, a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP))\n      may\
    \ be improved and re-documented many times in several different\n      RFCs. \
    \ It is important to verify that you have the most recent RFC\n      on a particular\
    \ protocol.  The \"IAB Official Protocol Standards\"\n      [2] memo is the reference\
    \ for determining the correct RFC to refer\n      to for the current specification\
    \ of each protocol.\n   How do I obtain RFCs?\n      RFCs are available online\
    \ at several repositories around the\n      world.  For a list of repositories\
    \ and instructions about how to\n      obtain RFCs from each of the major US ones,\
    \ FTP the file in-\n      notes/rfc-retrieval.txt from the host ISI.EDU.  That\
    \ host supports\n      anonymous login.  You can also get information about RFC\n\
    \      repositories via electronic mail.  Send a message to rfc-\n      info@isi.edu.\
    \  In the body of the message, type\n      \"help: ways_to_get_rfcs\" (without\
    \ the quotes).\n      Two examples of obtaining RFCs online follow.\n      RFCs\
    \ can be obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname\n      rfc/rfcNNNN.txt\
    \ (where \"NNNN\" refers to the number of the RFC).\n      Login using FTP, username\
    \ \"anonymous\" and password \"guest\".\n      RFCs can also be obtained via FTP\
    \ from NIS.NSF.NET.  Using FTP,\n      login with username \"anonymous\" and password\
    \ \"guest\"; then connect\n      to the RFC directory (\"cd RFC\").  The file\
    \ name is of the form\n      RFCnnnn.TXT-1 (where \"nnnn\" refers to the number\
    \ of the RFC).  The\n      NIS also provides an automatic mail service for those\
    \ sites which\n      cannot use FTP.  Address the request to NIS-INFO@NIS.NSF.NET\
    \ and\n      leave the subject field of the message blank.  The first line of\n\
    \      the text of the message must be \"SEND RFCnnnn.TXT-1\", where nnnn\n  \
    \    is replaced by the RFC number.\n      Requests for special distribution should\
    \ be addressed to either\n      the author of the RFC in question, to NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL,\
    \ or to\n      NISC@NISC.SRI.COM.  SRI International operates the\n      FTP.NISC.SRI.COM\
    \ online repository of RFCs and other files, and\n      makes the RFCs available\
    \ in hardcopy for those people who have\n      neither FTP nor e-mail access to\
    \ the Internet.  Hardcopy RFCs are\n      sold by SRI on a cost-recovery basis.\
    \  In addition, SRI has a\n      hardcopy subscription service for RFCs, as well\
    \ as several\n      publications that incorporate selections of RFCs.  Unless\n\
    \      specifically noted otherwise on the RFC itself, all RFCs are for\n    \
    \  unlimited distribution.\n   How do I obtain a list of RFCs?\n      SRI maintains\
    \ a file that is an index of the RFCs.  It lists each\n      RFC, starting with\
    \ the most recent, and for each RFC provides the\n      number, title, author(s),\
    \ issue date, and number of hardcopy\n      pages.  In addition, it lists the\
    \ online formats (PostScript or\n      ASCII text) for each RFC and the number\
    \ of bytes each such version\n      is online.  If an RFC is also an FYI, that\
    \ fact is noted, with the\n      corresponding FYI number.  (There is a parallel\
    \ FYI Index\n      available).  Finally, the Index notes whether or not an RFC\
    \ is\n      obsoleted or updated by another RFC, and gives the number of that\n\
    \      RFC, or if an RFC itself obsoletes or updates another RFC, and\n      gives\
    \ that RFC number.  The index is updated online each time an\n      RFC is issued.\n\
    \      This RFC Index is available online for anonymous FTP from the\n      FTP.NISC.SRI.COM\
    \ host as rfc/rfc-index.txt.  The FYI Index is\n      online as fyi/fyi-index.txt.\
    \  They are also available via\n      electronic mail by sending a message to\
    \ mail-server@nisc.sri.com.\n      In the body of the message, say \"send rfc-index\"\
    \ or \"send fyi-\n      index\" (don't use quotes, but do use lowercase).  The\
    \ RFC Index is\n      also available from the SRI in hardcopy for $12, as are\
    \ individual\n      RFCs.  Call SRI at 1-415-859-3695 for help in obtaining the\
    \ Index.\n   What is the RFC-INFO service?\n      The Information Sciences Institute,\
    \ University of Southern\n      California (ISI) has announced a service called\
    \ RFC-Info.  Even\n      though this is a service, rather than a document, we'll\
    \ discuss it\n      in this section because it is so closely tied to RFC information.\n\
    \      RFC-Info is an e-mail based service to help in locating and\n      retrival\
    \ of RFCs and FYIs.  Users can ask for \"lists\" of all RFCs\n      and FYIs having\
    \ certain attributes (\"filters\") such as their ID,\n      keywords, title, author,\
    \ issuing organization, and date.  Once an\n      RFC is uniquely identified (e.g.,\
    \ by its RFC number) it may also\n      be retrieved.\n      To use the service\
    \ send e-mail to RFC-INFO@ISI.EDU with your\n      requests in the body of the\
    \ message.  Feel free to put anything in\n      the SUBJECT, the system ignores\
    \ it.  All input is case\n      independent.  Report problems to RFC-MANAGER@ISI.EDU.\n\
    \      To get started, you may send a message to RFC-INFO@ISI.EDU with\n     \
    \ requests such as in the following examples (without the\n      explanations\
    \ between brackets):\n"

    \ RFCs are Standards?\n      See \"IAB Official Protocol Standards\" (currently,\
    \ RFC 1280) [2].\n   What is an FYI?\n      FYI stands for For Your Information.\
    \  FYIs are a subset of the RFC\n      series of online documents.\n      FYI\
    \ 1 states, \"The FYI series of notes is designed to provide\n      Internet users\
    \ with a central repository of information about any\n      topics which relate\
    \ to the Internet.  FYI topics may range from\n      historical memos on operational\
    \ questions.  The FYIs are intended\n      for a wide audience.  Some FYIs will\
    \ cater to beginners, while\n      others will discuss more advanced topics.\"\
    \n      In general, then, FYI documents tend to be more information\n      oriented,\
    \ while RFCs are usually (but not always) more technically\n      oriented.\n\
    \      FYI documents are assigned both an FYI number and an RFC number.\n    \
    \  As RFCs, if an FYI is ever updated, it is issued again with a new\n      RFC\
    \ number; however, its FYI number remains unchanged.  This can\n      be a little\
    \ confusing at first, but the aim is to help users\n      identify which FYIs\
    \ are about which topics.  For example, FYI 4\n      will always be FYI 4, even\
    \ though it may be updated several times\n      and during that process receive\
    \ different RFC numbers.  Thus, you\n      need only to remember the FYI number\
    \ to find the proper document.\n      Of course, remembering titles often works\
    \ as well.\n      FYIs can be obtained in the same way RFCs can and from the same\n\
    \      repositories.  In general, their pathnames are fyi/fyiNN.txt or\n     \
    \ fyi/fyiNN.ps, where NN is the number of the FYI without leading\n      zeroes.\n\
    \   What is an STD?\n      The newest subseries of RFCs are the STDs (Standards).\
    \  RFC 1311\n      [12], which introduces this subseries, states that the intent\
    \ of\n      STDs is to identify clearly those RFCs that document Internet\n  \
    \    standards.  An STD number will be assigned only to those\n      specifications\
    \ that have completed the full process of\n      standardization in the Internet.\
    \  Existing Internet standards have\n      been assigned STD numbers; a list of\
    \ them can be found both in RFC\n      1311 and in the IAB Official Protocol Standards\
    \ RFC.\n      Like FYIs, once a standard has been assigned an STD number, that\n\
    \      number will not change, even if the standard is reworked and re-\n    \
    \  specified and later issued with a new RFC number.\n      It is important to\
    \ differentiate between a \"standard\" and\n      \"document.\" Different RFC\
    \ documents will always have different RFC\n      numbers.  However, sometimes\
    \ the complete specification for a\n      standard will be contained in more than\
    \ one RFC document.  When\n      this happens, each of the RFC documents that\
    \ is part of the\n      specification for that standard will carry the same STD\
    \ number.\n      For example, the Domain Name System (DNS) is specified by the\n\
    \      combination of RFC 1034 and RFC 1035; therefore, both of those\n      RFCs\
    \ are labeled STD 13.\n   What is the Internet Monthly Report?\n      The Internet\
    \ Monthly Report communicates online to the Internet\n      Research Group the\
    \ accomplishments, milestones reached, or\n      problems discovered by the participating\
    \ organizations.  Many\n      organizations involved in the Internet provide monthly\
    \ updates of\n      their activities for inclusion in this report.\n      The\
    \ Internet Monthly Report is for Internet information purposes\n      only.\n\
    \      You can receive the report online by joining the mailing list that\n  \
    \    distributes the rerpot.  Requests to be added or deleted from the\n     \
    \ Internet Monthly report list should be sent to \"cooper@isi.edu\".\n      In\
    \ addition, back issues of the Report are available for anonymous\n      FTP from\
    \ the host NIS.NSF.NET in the 'imr' directory with the file\n      names in the\
    \ form IMRYY-MM.TXT, where YY is the last two digits of\n      the year and MM\
    \ two digits for the month.  For example, the June\n      1991 Report is in the\
    \ file IMR91-06.TXT.\n   What is an Internet Draft?  Are there any guidelines\
    \ available for\n   writing one?\n      Internet Drafts (I-Ds) are the current\
    \ working documents of the\n      IETF.  Internet Drafts are generally in the\
    \ format of an RFC with\n      some key differences:\n         -  The Internet\
    \ Drafts are not RFCs and are not a numbered\n            document series.\n \
    \        -  The words INTERNET-DRAFT appear in place of RFC XXXX\n           \
    \ in the upper left-hand corner.\n         -  The document does not refer to itself\
    \ as an RFC or as a\n            Draft RFC.\n         -  An Internet Draft does\
    \ not state nor imply that it is a\n            proposed standard.  To do so conflicts\
    \ with the role of\n            the IAB, the RFC Editor, and the Internet Engineering\n\
    \            Steering Group (IESG).\n      An Internet Drafts Directory has been\
    \ installed to make available,\n      for review and comment by the IETF members,\
    \ draft documents that\n      will be submitted ultimately to the IAB and the\
    \ RFC Editor to be\n      considered for publishing as an RFC.  The Internet Drafts\n\
    \      Directories are maintained primarily at the NSFNET Network Service\n  \
    \    Center (NNSC).  There are several \"shadow\" machines which contain\n   \
    \   the IETF and Internet Drafts Directories.  They are:\n         NSF Network\

    .  Internet Draft files can\n      then be retrieved.\n      For further information\

  - "7. Questions about Internet Organizations and Contacts\n   What is the IAB?\n\
    \      The Internet Activities Board (IAB) is the coordinating committee\n   \
    \   for Internet design, engineering and management [7].  IAB members\n      are\
    \ deeply committed to making the Internet function effectively\n      and evolve\
    \ to meet a large scale, high speed future.  The chairman\n      serves a term\
    \ of two years and is elected by the members of the\n      IAB.  The current Chair\
    \ of the IAB is Lyman Chapin.  The IAB\n      focuses on the TCP/IP protocol suite,\
    \ and extensions to the\n      Internet system to support multiple protocol suites.\n\
    \      The IAB performs the following functions:\n         1)   Sets Internet\
    \ Standards,\n         2)   Manages the RFC publication process,\n         3)\
    \   Reviews the operation of the IETF and IRTF,\n         4)   Performs strategic\
    \ planning for the Internet, identifying\n              long-range problems and\
    \ opportunities,\n         5)   Acts as an international technical policy liaison\
    \ and\n              representative for the Internet community, and\n        \
    \ 6)   Resolves technical issues which cannot be treated within\n            \
    \  the IETF or IRTF frameworks.\n      The IAB has two principal subsidiary task\
    \ forces:\n         1)  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\n         2)  Internet\
    \ Research Task Force (IRTF)\n      Each of these Task Forces is led by a chairman\
    \ and guided by a\n      Steering Group which reports to the IAB through its chairman.\
    \  For\n      the most part, a collection of Research or Working Groups carries\n\
    \      out the work program of each Task Force.\n      All decisions of the IAB\
    \ are made public.  The principal vehicle\n      by which IAB decisions are propagated\
    \ to the parties interested in\n      the Internet and its TCP/IP protocol suite\
    \ is the Request for\n      Comments (RFC) note series and the Internet Monthly\
    \ Report.\n   What is the IETF?\n      The Internet has grown to encompass a large\
    \ number of widely\n      geographically dispersed networks in academic and research\n\
    \      communities.  It now provides an infrastructure for a broad\n      community\
    \ with various interests.  Moreover, the family of\n      Internet protocols and\
    \ system components has moved from\n      experimental to commercial development.\
    \  To help coordinate the\n      operation, management and evolution of the Internet,\
    \ the IAB\n      established the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).\n   \
    \   The IETF is chaired by Phill Gross and managed by its Internet\n      Engineering\
    \ Steering Group (IESG).  The IETF is a large open\n      community of network\
    \ designers, operators, vendors, and\n      researchers concerned with the Internet\
    \ and the Internet protocol\n      suite.  It is organized around a set of several\
    \ technical areas,\n      each managed by a technical area director.  In addition\
    \ to the\n      IETF Chairman, the area directors make up the IESG membership.\n\
    \      The IAB has delegated to the IESG the general responsibility for\n    \
    \  making the Internet work and for the resolution of all short- and\n      mid-range\
    \ protocol and architectural issues required to make the\n      Internet function\
    \ effectively.\n   What is the IRTF?\n      To promote research in networking\
    \ and the development of new\n      technology, the IAB established the Internet\
    \ Research Task Force\n      (IRTF).\n      In the area of network protocols,\
    \ the distinction between research\n      and engineering is not always clear,\
    \ so there will sometimes be\n      overlap between activities of the IETF and\
    \ the IRTF.  There is, in\n      fact, considerable overlap in membership between\
    \ the two groups.\n      This overlap is regarded as vital for cross-fertilization\
    \ and\n      technology transfer.\n      The IRTF is a community of network researchers,\
    \ generally with an\n      Internet focus.  The work of the IRTF is governed by\
    \ its Internet\n      Research Steering Group (IRSG).  The chairman of the IRTF\
    \ and IRSG\n      is Jon Postel.\n   What is the Internet Society?\n      The\
    \ Internet Society is a relatively new, professional, non-profit\n      organization\
    \ with the general goal of fostering the well-being and\n      continued interest\
    \ in, and evolution and use of the Internet.  The\n      Society (often abbreviated\
    \ ISOC) anticipates that it will\n      integrate the IAB, IETF, and IRTF functions\
    \ into its operation.\n      The following goals of the Society are taken from\
    \ its charter:\n             A.  To facilitate and support the technical evolution\
    \ of\n         the Internet as a research and education infrastructure, and to\n\
    \         stimulate the involvement of the scientific community,\n         industry,\
    \ government and others in the evolution of the\n         Internet;\n        \
    \     B.  To educate the scientific community, industry and the\n         public\
    \ at large concerning the technology, use and application\n         of the Internet;\n\
    \             C.  To promote educational applications of Internet\n         technology\
    \ for the benefit of government, colleges and\n         universities, industry,\
    \ and the public at large;\n             D.  To provide a forum for exploration\
    \ of new Internet\n         applications, and to stimulate collaboration among\n\
    \         organizations in their operational use of the global Internet.\n   \

    \  What is a NOC?\n      \"NIC\" stands for Network Information Center.  It is\
    \ an\n      organization which provides network users with information about\n\
    \      services provided by the network.\n      \"NOC\" stands Network Operations\
    \ Center.  It is an organization\n      that is responsible for maintaining a\
    \ network.\n      For many networks, especially smaller, local networks, the\n\
    \      functions of the NIC and NOC are combined.  For larger networks,\n    \
    \  such as mid-level and backbone networks, the NIC and NOC\n      organizations\
    \ are separate, yet they do need to interact to fully\n      perform their functions.\n\
    \   What is \"The NIC\"?\n      \"The NIC\" usually refers to the Defense Data\
    \ Network, Network\n      Information Center (DDN NIC), which is now at Network\
    \ Solutions,\n      Inc.  The DDN NIC is a network information center that maintains\
    \ a\n      repository for RFCs and Internet Drafts.  The host name is\n      NIC.DDN.MIL.\
    \  Shadow copies of the RFCs and the Internet Drafts\n      are maintained on\
    \ several other hosts as well, including\n      NIS.NSF.NET and FTP.NISC.SRI.COM.\n\
    \      The DDN NIC also provides various user assistance services for DDN\n  \
    \    users; contact NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL or call 1-800-365-3642 for more\n      information.\
    \  In addition, the DDN NIC is the Internet\n      registration authority for\
    \ the root domain and several top and\n      second level domains; maintains the\
    \ official DoD Internet Host\n      Table; is the site of the Internet Registry\
    \ (IR); and maintains\n      the WHOIS database of network users, hosts, domains,\
    \ networks, and\n      Points of Contact.\n      This NIC was located for many\
    \ years at SRI International, so you\n      may also hear the term \"SRI NIC\"\
    .  SRI also maintains an online\n      information repository and provides general\
    \ Internet information\n      services.  For example, the SRI Network Information\
    \ Systems Center\n      is currently the only site that provides paper copies\
    \ of the RFCs,\n      which are made available on a cost recovery basis.  Call\
    \ 415-859-\n      3695 for more information on this service.\n   What is the IR?\n\
    \      The Internet Registry (IR) is the organization that is responsible\n  \
    \    for assigning identifiers, such as IP network numbers and\n      autonomous\
    \ system numbers, to networks.  The IR also gathers and\n      registers such\
    \ assigned information.  The IR may, in the future,\n      allocate the authority\
    \ to assign network identifiers to other\n      organizations; however, it will\
    \ continue to gather data regarding\n      such assignments.  At present, the\
    \ DDN NIC at Network Solutions,\n      Inc., serves as the IR.\n"

  - "8. Questions About Services\n   How do I find someone's electronic mail address?\n\
    \      There are a number of directories on the Internet; however, all of\n  \
    \    them are far from complete.  The largest directories are the WHOIS\n    \
    \  database at the DDN NIC, the PSInet White Pages, and KNOWBOT.\n      Generally,\
    \ it is still necessary to ask the person for his or her\n      email address.\n\
    \   How do I use the WHOIS program at the DDN NIC?\n      To use the WHOIS program\
    \ to search the WHOIS database at the DDN\n      NIC, TELNET to the NIC host,\
    \ NIC.DDN.MIL.  There is no need to\n      login.  Type \"whois\" to call up the\
    \ information retrieval program.\n      Next, type the name of the person, host,\
    \ domain, network, or\n      mailbox for which you need information.  If you are\
    \ only typing\n      part of the name, end your search string with a period. \
    \ Type\n      \"help\" for a more in-depth explanation of what you can search\
    \ for\n      and how you can search.  If you have trouble, send a message to\n\
    \      NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL or call 1-800-365-3642.\n   How do I become registered\
    \ in the DDN NIC's WHOIS database?\n      If you would like to be listed in the\
    \ WHOIS database, you must\n      have an electronic mailbox accessible from the\
    \ Internet.  First\n      obtain the file netinfo/user-template.txt.  You can\
    \ retrieve this\n      file via anonymous FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL.\n      Fill out\
    \ the name and address information requested in the file\n      and return it\
    \ to REGISTRAR@NIC.DDN.MIL.  Your application will be\n      processed and you\
    \ will be added to the database.  Unless you are\n      an official Point of Contact\
    \ for a network entity registered at\n      the DDN NIC, the DDN NIC will not\
    \ regularly poll you for updates,\n      so you should remember to send corrections\
    \ to your information as\n      your contact data changes.\n   How do I use the\
    \ White Pages at PSI?\n      Performance Systems International, Inc. (PSI), sponsors\
    \ a White\n      Pages Pilot Project that collects personnel information from\n\
    \      member organizations into a database and provides online access to\n  \
    \    that data.  This effort is based on the OSI X.500 Directory\n      standard.\n\
    \      To access the data, TELNET to WP.PSI.COM and login as \"fred\" (no\n  \
    \    password is necessary).  You may now look up information on\n      participating\
    \ organizations.  The program provides help on usage.\n      For example, typing\
    \ \"help\" will show you a list of commands,\n      \"manual\" will give detailed\
    \ documentation, and \"whois\" will\n      provide information regarding how to\
    \ find references to people.\n      For a list of the organizations that are participating\
    \ in the\n      pilot project by providing information regarding their members,\n\
    \      type \"whois -org *\".\n      For more information, send a message to WP-INFO@PSI.COM.\n\
    \   How do I use the Knowbot Information Service?\n      The Knowbot Information\
    \ Service is a white pages \"meta-service\"\n      that provides a uniform interface\
    \ to heterogeneous white pages\n      services in the Internet.  Using the Knowbot\
    \ Information Service,\n      you can form a single query that can search for\
    \ white pages\n      information from the NIC WHOIS service, the PSI White Pages\
    \ Pilot\n      Project, and MCI Mail, among others, and have the responses\n \
    \     displayed in a single, uniform format.\n      Currently, the Knowbot Information\
    \ Service can be accessed through\n      TELNET to port 185 on hosts nri.reston.va.us\
    \ and sol.bucknell.edu.\n      From a UNIX host, use \"telnet nri.reston.va.us\
    \ 185\".  There is\n      also an electronic mail interface avaliable by sending\
    \ mail to\n      netaddress at either nri.reston.va.us or sol.bucknell.edu.\n\
    \      The commands \"help\" and \"man\" summarize the command interface.\n  \
    \    Simply entering a user name at the prompt searches a default list\n     \
    \ of Internet directory services for the requested information.\n      Organization\
    \ and country information can be included thorgh the\n      syntax: \"userid@organization.country\"\
    .  For example, the queries\n      \"droms@bucknell\" and \"kille@ucl.gb\" are\
    \ both valid.  Note that\n      these are not Domain Names, but rather a syntax\
    \ to specify an\n      organization and a country for the search.\n      The default\
    \ list of directory services currently includes the\n      whois services at the\
    \ DDN NIC and the white pages service for\n      MCIMail.  If an organization\
    \ is specified, the PSI X.500 service\n      is also searched.  Other services\
    \ can be requested explicitly.\n   What is USENET?  What is Netnews?\n      USENET\
    \ is the formal name, and Netnews a common informal name, for\n      a distributed\
    \ computer information service that some hosts on the\n      Internet use.  USENET\
    \ handles only news and not mail.  USENET uses\n      a variety of underlying\
    \ networks for transport, including parts of\n      the Internet, UUCP, BITNET,\
    \ and others.  USENET is not part of the\n      Internet proper.  Netnews can\
    \ be a valuable tool to economically\n      transport traffic that would otherwise\
    \ be sent via mail.  USENET\n      has no central administration.\n   How do I\
    \ get on USENET?\n      To get on USENET, you must acquire the software, which\
    \ is\n      available for some computers at no cost from some anonymous FTP\n\
    \      sites across the Internet, and you must find an existing USENET\n     \
    \ site that is willing to support a connection to your computer.  In\n      many\
    \ cases, this \"connection\" merely represents additional traffic\n      over\
    \ existing Internet access channels.\n      One well-known anonymous FTP archive\
    \ site for software and\n      information regarding USENET is ftp.uu.net.  There\
    \ is a \"news\"\n      directory which contains many software distribution and\n\
    \      information sub-directories.\n      It is recommended that new users subscribe\
    \ to and read\n      news.announce.newusers since it will help to become oriented\
    \ to\n      USENET and the Internet.\n   What is anonymous FTP?\n      Anonymous\
    \ FTP is a conventional way of allowing you to sign on to\n      a computer on\
    \ the Internet and copy specified public files from it\n      [3].  Some sites\
    \ offer anonymous FTP to distribute software and\n      various kinds of information.\
    \  You use it like any FTP, but the\n      username is \"anonymous\".  Many systems\
    \ will allow any password and\n      request that the password you choose is your\
    \ userid.  If this\n      fails, the generic password is usually \"guest\".\n\
    \   What is \"archie\"?\n      The archie system was created by a group at McGill\
    \ University in\n      Montreal to automatically track anonymous FTP archive sites,\
    \ and\n      this is still its primary function.  The system curently makes\n\
    \      available the names and locations of some 1,500,000 files at some\n   \
    \   900 archive sites.\n      Archie's User Access component allows you to search\
    \ the \"files\"\n      database for these filenames.  When matches are found,\
    \ you are\n      presented with the appropriate archive site name, IP address,\
    \ the\n      location within the archive, and other useful information.\n    \
    \  You can also use archie to \"browse\" through a site's complete\n      listing\
    \ in search of information of interest, or obtain a complete\n      list of the\
    \ archive sites known to that server.\n      The archie server also offers a \"\
    package descriptions\" (or\n      \"whatis\") database. This is a collection of\
    \ names and descriptions\n      gathered from a variety of sources and can be\
    \ used to identify\n      files located throughout the Internet, as well as other\
    \ useful\n      information.  Files identified in the whatis database can then\
    \ be\n      found by searching the files database as described above.\n      Additional\
    \ databases are planned for the coming months.\n   How do I connect to archie?\n\
    \      You can connect to archie in a variety of ways. There is a\n      conventional\
    \ TELNET interface, an electronic mail interface, and a\n      variety of client\
    \ programs available.  There are currently nine\n      archie servers located\
    \ throughout the world.\n      To try the TELNET interface to archie you can TELNET\
    \ to the host\n      ARCHIE.MCGILL.CA and login as user \"archie\" (there is no\
    \ password\n      required).  Type \"help\" to get you started.  The \"servers\"\
    \ command\n      can be used to locate an archie server closer to your site. \
    \ Using\n      an archie server closer to you relieves some of the load on the\n\
    \      McGill host.\n      You can obtain details on using the electronic mail\
    \ interface by\n      sending mail to \"archie@archie.mcgill.ca\" with the word\
    \ \"help\" in\n      either the subject or body of the message.\n      Documentation\
    \ on archie is available for anonymous ftp from\n      ARCHIE.MCGILL.CA in the\
    \ subdirectory \"archie/doc\".  A variety of\n      archie client programs are\
    \ available in the subdirectory\n      \"archie/clients\".  Questions, comments,\
    \ and suggestions can be\n      sent to the archie development group by sending\
    \ mail to \"archie-\n      group@archie.mcgill.ca\".\n   What is \"TELNET\"?\n\
    \      The term \"TELNET\" refers to the remote login that's possible on\n   \
    \   the Internet because of the TELNET Protocol [9].  The use of this\n      term\
    \ as a verb, as in \"telnet to a host\" means to establish a\n      connection\
    \ across the Internet from one host to another.  Usually,\n      you must have\
    \ an account on the remote host to be able to login to\n      it once you've made\
    \ a connection.  However, some hosts, such as\n      those offering white pages\
    \ directories, provide public services\n      that do not require a personal account.\n"

  contents:
  - "9. Mailing Lists and Sending Mail\n   What is a mailing list?\n      A mailing\
    \ list is really nothing more than an alias that has\n      multiple destinations.\
    \  Mailing lists are usually created to\n      discuss specific topics.  Anybody\
    \ interested in that topic, may\n      (usually) join that list.  Some mailing\
    \ lists have membership\n      restrictions, others have message content restrictions,\
    \ and still\n      others are moderated.  Most large, \"public\" mailing lists,\
    \ such as\n      IETF and TCP-IP, have an additional mail address to which requests\n\
    \      to be added or deleted may be sent.  Usually, these are of the\n      form\
    \ listname-request.\n      There is a \"list-of-lists\" file available on the\
    \ host\n      ftp.nisc.sri.com that lists most of the major mailing lists,\n \
    \     describes their primary topics, and explains how to subscribe to\n     \
    \ them.  The file is available for anonymous ftp in the netinfo\n      directory\
    \ as interest-groups (that is, the path is:\n      netinfo/interest-groups). \
    \ It can also be obtained via electronic\n      mail.  Send a message to mail-server@nisc.sri.com\
    \ with the body of\n      the message reading, \"Send netinfo/interest-groups\"\
    \ and the file\n      will be returned in moderate size pieces via electronic\
    \ mail.\n   How do I contact the administrator of a mailing list rather than\n\
    \      posting to the entire list?\n      For every mailing list mentioned in\
    \ the \"interest-groups\" file,\n      there is a description of how to join the\
    \ list or send other such\n      administrative messages to the person in charge\
    \ of the list.  In\n      general, however, it is usually safe to assume that\
    \ you can send a\n      message to an address in the format of ListName-request@domain.\n\
    \      The convention of having a parallel mailbox conforming to the \"-\n   \
    \   request\" format is very widely followed.  All administrative\n      messages\
    \ regarding using, joining, or quitting the list should be\n      sent to that\
    \ mailbox instead of to the whole list so that the\n      readers of the list\
    \ don't have to read them.\n   What are some good mailing lists?\n      The TCP-IP,\
    \ IETF, and RFC Distribution lists are primary lists for\n      new Internet users\
    \ who desire further information about current\n      and emerging developments\
    \ in the Internet.  The first two lists\n      are unmoderated discussion lists,\
    \ and the latter is an\n      announcement service used by the RFC Editor.\n \
    \  How do I subscribe to the TCP-IP mailing list?\n      To be added to the TCP-IP\
    \ mailing list, send a message to:\n         TCP-IP-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL\n   How\
    \ do I subscribe to the IETF mailing list?\n      To be added to the IETF mailing\
    \ list, send a message to:\n         IETF-REQUEST@ISI.EDU\n   How do I subscribe\
    \ to the RFC Distribution list?\n      To be added to the RFC Distribution list,\
    \ send a message to:\n         RFC-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL\n      Note that all announcements\
    \ to this list are also sent to the IETF\n      list.  So, if you are on the IETF\
    \ list, you don't need to be on\n      this list, too.\n   How do I send mail\
    \ to other networks?\n      Mail to the Internet is addressed in the form user@domain.\n\
    \      Remember that a domain name can have several components and the\n     \
    \ name of each host is a node on the domain tree.  So, an example of\n      an\
    \ Internet mail address is june@nisc.sri.com.\n      There are several networks\
    \ accessible via e-mail from the\n      Internet, but many of these networks do\
    \ not use the same\n      addressing conventions the Internet does.  Often you\
    \ must route\n      mail to these networks through specific gateways as well,\
    \ thus\n      further complicating the address.\n      Here are a few conventions\
    \ you can use for sending mail from the\n      Internet to three networks with\
    \ which Internet users often\n      correspond.\n        Internet user to Internet\
    \ user:\n          username@hostname.subdomain.toplevel domain\n          e.g.\
    \ gsmith@nisc.sri.COM\n        Internet user to BITNET user:\n          user%site.BITNET@BITNET-GATEWAY\n\
    \          e.g. gsmith%emoryu1.BITNET@cunyvm.cuny.edu.\n               gsmith%emoryu1@CORNELLC.CIT.CORNELL.EDU\n\
    \        Internet user to UUCP user:\n          user%host.UUCP@uunet.uu.net\n\
    \          user%domain@uunet.uu.net\n        Internet user to SprintMail user:\n\
    \          /G=Mary/S=Anderson/O=co.abc/ADMD=SprintMail/C=US/@SPRINT.COM\n    \
    \      -or-\n          /PN=Mary.Anderson/O=co.abc/ADMD=SprintMail/C=US/@SPRINT.COM\n\
    \          (Case is significant.)\n        Internet user to CompuServe user:\n\
    \                Replace the comma in the CompuServe userid (represented\n   \
    \     here\n                with x's) with a period, and add the compuserve.com\n\
    \        domain         name.\n        CompuServe user to Internet user:\n   \
    \             >Internet:user@host         Insert >internet: before an\n      \
    \  Internet address.\n        Internet user to MCIMail user:\n          accountname@mcimail.com\n\
    \          mci_id@mcimail.com\n          full_user_name@mcimail.com.\n   What\
    \ is a newsgroup?\n      A newsgroup is a bulletin board which readers, interested\
    \ in that\n      newsgroup's particular topic, can read and respond to messages\n\
    \      posted by other readers.  Generally, there will be a few \"threads\"\n\
    \      of discussion going on at the same time, but they all share some\n    \
    \  common theme.  There are approximately 900 newsgroups, and there\n      are\
    \ more being added all the time.\n      There are two types of newsgroups: moderated\
    \ and unmoderated.  A\n      moderated newsgroup does not allow individuals to\
    \ post directly to\n      the newsgroup.  Rather, the postings go to the newsgroup's\n\
    \      moderator who determines whether or not to pass the posting to the\n  \
    \    entire group.  An unmoderated newsgroup allows a reader to post\n      directly\

    \ In many electronic mail messages, it is sometimes useful to\n      indicate\
    \ that part of a message is meant in jest.  It is also\n      sometimes useful\
    \ to communicate emotion which simple words do not\n      readily convey.  To\
    \ provide these nuances, a collection of \"smiley\n      faces\" has evolved.\
    \  If you turn your head sideways to the left,\n      :-) appears as a smiling\
    \ face.  Some of the more common faces are:\n         :-)  smile             \
    \       :-(  frown\n         :)   also a smile             ;-)  wink\n       \

    \ National Science Foundation Network\n           The NSFNET is a highspeed \"\
    network of networks\" which is\n           hierarchical in nature.  At the highest\
    \ level is a\n           backbone network currently comprising 16 nodes connected\n\
    \           to a 45Mbps facility which spans the continental United\n        \
    \   States.  Attached to that are mid-level networks and\n           attached\
    \ to the mid-levels are campus and local\n           networks.  NSFNET also has\
    \ connections out of the U.S.\n           to Canada, Mexico, Europe, and the Pacific\
    \ Rim.  The\n           NSFNET is part of the Internet.\n   NSFNET  Mid-level\
    \ Level Network\n           A network connected to the highest level of the NSFNET\
    \ that\n           covers a region of the United States.  It is to mid-level\n\
    \           networks that local sites connect.  The mid-level networks\n     \
    \      were once called \"regionals\".\n   OSI     Open Systems Interconnection\n\
    \           A set of protocols designed to be an international standard\n    \
    \       method for connecting unlike computers and networks.  Europe\n       \
    \    has done most of the work developing OSI and will probably\n           use\
    \ it as soon as possible.\n   OSI Reference Model\n           An \"outline\" of\

    \ First Interior Gateway Protocol\n           A proposed replacement for RIP.\
    \  It addresses some\n           problems of RIP and is based upon principles\
    \ that have\n           been well-tested in non-internet protocols.  Originally\n\
    \           acronymed as OSPFIGP.\n   packet  The unit of data sent across a packet\
    \ switching network.\n           The term is used loosely.  While some Internet\n\
    \           literature uses it to refer specifically to data sent\n          \
    \ across a physical network, other literature views\n           the Internet as\
    \ a packet switching network\n           and describes IP datagrams as packets.\n\
    \   PC      Personal Computer\n   PCNFS   Personal Computer Network File System\n\
    \   PPP     Point-to-Point Protocol\n           The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)\
    \ provides a method for\n           transmitting datagrams over serial point-to-point\
    \ links.\n   protocol\n           A formal description of message formats and\
    \ the rules\n           two computers must follow to exchange those messages.\n\
    \           Protocols can describe low-level details of\n           machine-to-machine\
    \ interfaces (e.g., the order in\n           which bits and bytes are sent across\
    \ a wire)\n           or high-level exchanges between allocation\n           programs\
    \ (e.g., the way in which two programs\n           transfer a file across the\
    \ Internet).\n   RFC     The Internet's Request for Comments documents series\n\
    \           The RFCs are working notes of the Internet research and\n        \
    \   development community.  A document in this series may be on\n           essentially\

    \ from a meeting report to the specification of\n           a standard.\n   RIP\
    \     Routing Information Protocol\n           One protocol which may be used\
    \ on internets simply to pass\n           routing information between gateways.\

    \ for submitting batch jobs and\n           retrieving the results.\n   router\
    \  A special-purpose dedicated computer that attaches to\n           two or more\
    \ networks and routes packets from one\n           network to the other.  In particular,\
    \ an Internet\n           router forwards IP datagrams among the networks it\n\
    \           connects.  Gateways route packets to other\n           gateways until\
    \ they can be delivered to the final\n           destination directly across one\
    \ physical network.\n   RPC     Remote Procedure Call\n           An easy and\
    \ popular paradigm for implementing the\n           client-server model of distributed\

    \ disk space with one or more\n           workstations that may not have local\
    \ disk drives of\n           their own.\n   SLIP    Serial Line Internet Protocol\n\
    \           SLIP is currently a defacto standard, commonly used for\n        \
    \   point-to-point serial connections running TCP/IP.  It is\n           not an\
    \ Internet standard but is defined in RFC 1055.\n   SMTP    Simple Mail Transfer\
    \ Protocol\n           The Internet standard protocol for transferring\n     \
    \      electronic mail messages from one computer to another.\n           SMTP\
    \ specifies how two mail systems interact and the\n           format of control\

    \    of hosts, routers and other nodes and devices on a network.\n   subnet  A\
    \ portion of a network, which may be a physically independent\n           network,\
    \ which shares a network address with other portions\n           of the network\
    \ and is distinguished by a subnet number.  A\n           subnet is to a network\
    \ what a network is to an internet.\n   subnet number\n           A part of the\
    \ internet address which designates a subnet.\n           It is ignored for the\
    \ purposes internet routing, but is\n           used for intranet routing.\n \
