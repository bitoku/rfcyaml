Abstract This document specifies restrictions on additions to the subset of the IANA XML Namespace and Schema registries, to require Expert Review for extensions to Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF).
Introduction IODEF extensions via class extension through AdditionalData and RecordItem elements, per Section 5.2 of [RFC5070], generally register their namespaces and schemas with the IANA XML Namespace registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml registry/ns.html and the IANA XML Schema registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml registry/schema.html, respectively [RFC3688].
In addition to schema reviews required by IANA, these registry requests should be accompanied by a review by IODEF experts to ensure the specified AdditionalData and/or RecordItem contents are compatible with IODEF and with other existing IODEF extensions.
This document specifies that review.
Expert Review of IODEF Related XML Registry Entries Changes to the XML Schema registry for schema names beginning with "urn:
:iodef" are subject to an additional IODEF Expert Review [RFC5226] for IODEF correctness and appropriateness.
The IODEF expert(s) for these reviews will be designated by the IETF Security Area Directors.
This document has no security considerations.
This document specifies additional expert reviews for IODEF extensions, on the XML Schema registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml registry/schema.html), in Section 2.
