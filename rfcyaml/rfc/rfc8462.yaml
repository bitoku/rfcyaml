  - "Abstract\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and GSM Association (GSMA)\
    \ held\n   a joint workshop on Managing Radio Networks in an Encrypted World\n\
    \   (MaRNEW), on September 24-25, 2015.  This workshop aimed to discuss\n   solutions\
    \ for bandwidth optimization on mobile networks for encrypted\n   content, as\
    \ current solutions rely on unencrypted content, which is\n   not indicative of\
    \ the security needs of today's Internet users.  The\n   workshop gathered IETF\
    \ attendees, IAB members, and participants from\n   various organizations involved\
    \ in the telecommunications industry\n   including original equipment manufacturers,\
    \ content providers, and\n   mobile network operators.\n   The group discussed\
    \ Internet encryption trends and deployment issues\n   identified within the IETF\
    \ and the privacy needs of users that should\n   be adhered to.  Solutions designed\
    \ around sharing data from the\n   network to the endpoints and vice versa were\
    \ then discussed; in\n   addition, issues experienced when using current transport-layer\n\
    \   protocols were also discussed.  Content providers and Content\n   Delivery\
    \ Networks (CDNs) gave their own views of their experiences\n   delivering their\
    \ content with mobile network operators.  Finally,\n   technical responses to\
    \ regulation were discussed to help the\n   regulated industries relay the issues\
    \ of impossible-to-implement or\n   bad-for-privacy technologies back to regulators.\n\
    \   A group of suggested solutions were devised, which will be discussed\n   in\
    \ various IETF groups moving forward.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and GSM Association\
    \ (GSMA) held\n   a joint workshop on Managing Radio Networks in an Encrypted\
    \ World\n   (MaRNEW), on September 24-25, 2015.  This workshop aimed to discuss\n\
    \   solutions for bandwidth optimization on mobile networks for encrypted\n  \
    \ content, as current solutions rely on unencrypted content, which is\n   not\
    \ indicative of the security needs of today's Internet users.\n   Mobile networks\
    \ have a set of properties that place a large emphasis\n   on sophisticated bandwidth\
    \ optimization.  The use of encryption is\n   increasing on the Internet, which\
    \ is positive for consumer and\n   business privacy and security.  Many existing\
    \ solutions for mobile\n   bandwidth optimization primarily operate on non-encrypted\n\
    \   communications; this can lead to performance issues being amplified\n   on\
    \ mobile networks.  The use of encryption on networks will continue\n   to increase;\
    \ with this understanding, the workshop aimed to\n   understand how we can solve\
    \ the issues of bandwidth optimization and\n   performance on radio networks in\
    \ this encrypted world.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Understanding "Bandwidth Optimization"
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Understanding \"Bandwidth Optimization\"\n   For the purposes of this workshop,\
    \ bandwidth optimization encompasses\n   a variety of technical topics related\
    \ to traffic engineering,\n   prioritization, optimization, and efficiency enhancements.\
    \  It also\n   encompasses user-related topics such as specific subscription or\n\
    \   billing models, and it may touch upon regulatory aspects or other\n   issues\
    \ relating to government-initiated regulatory concerns.\n   The first category\
    \ of bandwidth optimization includes the following:\n   o  Caching\n   o  Prioritization\
    \ of interactive traffic over background traffic\n   o  Per-user bandwidth limits\n\
    \   The second category of bandwidth optimization may depend on one or\n   more\
    \ of the first category optimization strategies, but may, in\n   particular, also\
    \ encompass business-related topics such as content\n   delivery arrangements\
    \ with content providers.\n   Finally, while not strictly speaking of traffic\
    \ management, some\n   networks employ policy-based filtering (e.g., requested\
    \ parental\n   controls), and many networks support some form of legal interception\n\
    \   functionality per applicable laws.\n   Many of these functions can continue\
    \ as they are performed today,\n   even with increased use of encryption.  Others\
    \ are using methods that\n   inspect parts of the communication that are not encrypted\
    \ today, but\n   will be encrypted, and these functions will have to be done\n\
    \   differently in an increasingly encrypted Internet.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Topics
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Topics\n   The workshop aimed to answer questions that focused on:\n  \
    \ o  understanding the bandwidth optimization use cases particular to\n      radio\
    \ networks;\n   o  understanding existing approaches and how these do not work\
    \ with\n      encrypted traffic;\n   o  understanding reasons why the Internet\
    \ has not standardized\n      support for lawful intercept and why mobile networks\
    \ have;\n   o  determining how to match traffic types with bandwidth optimization\n\
    \      methods\n   o  discussing minimal information to be shared to manage networks\
    \ but\n      ensure user security and privacy;\n   o  developing new bandwidth\
    \ optimization techniques and protocols\n      within these new constraints;\n\
    \   o  discussing the appropriate network layer(s) for each management\n     \
    \ function; and\n   o  cooperative methods of bandwidth optimization and issues\n\
    \      associated with these.\n   The further aim was to gather architectural\
    \ and engineering guidance\n   on future work in the bandwidth optimization area\
    \ based on the\n   discussions around the proposed approaches.  The workshop also\n\
    \   explored possible areas for standardization, e.g., new protocols that\n  \
    \ can aid bandwidth optimization whilst ensuring that user security is\n   in\
    \ line with new work in transport-layer protocols.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Organization of This Report
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Organization of This Report\n   This workshop report summarizes the contributions\
    \ to and discussions\n   at the workshop, organized by topic.  The workshop began\
    \ with scene-\n   setting topics that covered the issues around deploying encryption,\n\
    \   the increased need for privacy on the Internet, and setting a clear\n   understanding\
    \ that ciphertext should remain unbroken.  Later sessions\n   focused on key solution\
    \ areas; these included evolution on the\n   transport layer and sending data\
    \ up or down the path.  A session on\n   application layers and CDNs aimed to\
    \ highlight both issues and\n   solutions experienced on the application layer.\
    \  The workshop ended\n   with a session dedicated to discussing a technical response\
    \ to\n   regulation with regards to encryption.  The contributing documents\n\
    \   identified the issues experienced with encryption on radio networks\n   and\
    \ suggested solutions.  Of the solutions suggested, some focused on\n   transport\
    \ evolution, some on trusted middleboxes, and others on\n   collaborative data\
    \ exchange.  Solutions were discussed within the\n   sessions.  All accepted position\
    \ papers and detailed transcripts of\n   discussion are available at [MARNEW].\n\
    \   The outcomes of the workshop are discussed in Sections 7 and 8; they\n   discuss\
    \ the progress made since the workshop toward each of the\n   identified work\
    \ items through the time this document was approved for\n   publication.\n   Report\
    \ readers should be reminded that this workshop did not aim to\n   discuss regulation\
    \ or legislation, although policy topics were\n   mentioned in discussions from\
    \ time to time.\n"

  - "1.4.  Use of Note Well and the Chatham House Rule\n   The workshop was conducted\
    \ under the IETF [NOTE_WELL] with the\n   exception of the \"Technical Analysis\

    \ under the\n   [CHATHAM_HOUSE_RULE].\n"
- title: 1.5.  IETF and GSMA
  contents:
  - "1.5.  IETF and GSMA\n   The IETF and GSMA [GSMA] have different working practices,\
    \ standards,\n   and processes.  IETF is an open organization with community-driven\n\
    \   standards, with the key aim of functionality and security for the\n   Internet's\
    \ users, while the GSMA is membership based and serves the\n   needs of its membership\
    \ base, most of whom are mobile network\n   operators.\n   Unlike IETF, GSMA makes\
    \ few standards.  Within the telecommunications\n   industry, standards are set\
    \ in various divergent groups depending on\n   their purpose.  Perhaps of most\
    \ relevance to the bandwidth\n   optimization topic here is the work of the 3rd\
    \ Generation Partnership\n   Project (3GPP) [SDO_3GPP], which works on radio network\
    \ and core\n   network standards.  3GPP members include mobile operators and\n\
    \   original equipment manufacturers.\n   One of the 3GPP standards relevant to\
    \ this workshop is Policy and\n   Charging Control QoS [PCC-QOS].  Traditionally,\
    \ mobile networks have\n   managed different applications and services based on\
    \ the resources\n   available and priorities given; for instance, emergency services\
    \ have\n   a top priority, data has a lower priority, and voice services are\n\
    \   somewhere in-between.  3GPP defined the PCC-QoS mechanism to support\n   this\
    \ functionality, and this depends on unencrypted communications\n   [EffectEncrypt].\n"

  - "2.  Scene-Setting Sessions\n   Scene-setting sessions aimed to bring all attendees\
    \ up to a basic\n   understanding of the problem and the scope of the workshop.\n\
    \   There were three scene-setting sessions:\n   o  Section 2.1: Scene Setting\n\
    \   o  Section 2.2: Encryption Deployment Considerations\n   o  Section 2.3: Awareness\
    \ of User Choice (Privacy)\n"
- title: 2.1.  Scene Setting
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Scene Setting\n   The telecommunications industry and Internet standards\
    \ community are\n   extremely different in terms of ethos and practices.  Both\
    \ groups\n   drive technical standards in their domain and build technical\n \
    \  solutions with some policy-driven use cases.  These technologies, use\n   cases,\
    \ and technical implementations are different, and the\n   motivators between\
    \ the two industries are also diverse.\n   To ensure all attendees were aligned\
    \ with contributing to discussions\n   and driving solutions, this \"Scene Setting\"\
    \ session worked on\n   generating a clear scope with all attendees involved.\
    \  In short, it\n   was agreed that 1) ciphertext encrypted by one party and intended\
    \ to\n   be decrypted by a second party should not be decrypted by a third\n \
    \  party in any solution, 2) the Radio Access Network (RAN) does\n   experience\
    \ issues with increased encrypted traffic, 3) the RAN issues\n   need to be understood\
    \ precisely, and 4) the goal is to improve user\n   experience on the Internet.\
    \  Proposing new technical solutions based\n   on presumed future regulation was\
    \ not in scope.  The full scope is\n   given below.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Scope
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Scope\n   The attendees identified and agreed to the scope described\
    \ here.\n   We should do the following:\n   o  in discussion, assume that there\
    \ is no broken crypto; ciphertext\n      is increasingly common; congestion does\
    \ need to be controlled (as\n      do other transport issues); and network management,\
    \ including\n      efficient use of resources in RAN and elsewhere, has to work;\n\
    \   o  identify how/why RAN is different for transport, and attempt to\n     \
    \ understand the complexities of RAN (i.e., how hard it is to\n      manage) and\
    \ why those complexities matter;\n   o  identify the precise problems caused by\
    \ increased use of\n      encryption;\n   o  identify players (in addition to\
    \ end users), the resulting\n      tensions, and how ciphertext changes those\
    \ tensions;\n   o  discuss how some solutions will be radically changed by ciphertext\n\
    \      (it's ok to talk about that)\n   o  assume that the best possible quality\
    \ of experience for the end\n      user is a goal; and lastly,\n   o  for the\
    \ next two days, aim to analyze the situation and identify\n      specific achievable\
    \ tasks that could be tackled in the IETF or\n      GSMA (or elsewhere) and that\
    \ improve the Internet given the\n      assumptions above.\n   We should not delve\
    \ into the following:\n   o  ways of doing interception, legal or not, for the\
    \ reasons\n      described in [RFC2804]; and,\n   o  unpredictable political actions.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Encryption Statistics and Radio Access Network Differences
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Encryption Statistics and Radio Access Network Differences\n   According\
    \ to then-current statistics, attendees were shown that\n   encrypted content\
    \ reaches around 50% [STATE_BROWSER] [STATE_SERVER].\n   The IAB is encouraging\
    \ all IETF working groups to consider the effect\n   encryption being \"on by\
    \ default\" will have on new protocol work.  The\n   IETF is also working on encryption\
    \ at lower layers.  One recent\n   example of this work is opportunistic TCP encryption\
    \ within the TCP\n   Increased Security [TCPINC] Working Group.  The aims of these\
    \ work\n   items are greater security and privacy for end users and their data.\n\
    \   Telecommunications networks often contain middleboxes that operators\n   have\
    \ previously considered to be trusted, but qualifying trust is\n   difficult and\
    \ should not be assumed.  Some interesting use cases\n   exist with these middleboxes,\
    \ such as anti-spam and malware\n   detection, but these need to be balanced against\
    \ their ability to\n   open up cracks in the network for attacks such as pervasive\n\
    \   monitoring.\n   When operators increase the number of radio access network\
    \ cells\n   (base stations), this can improve the radio access network quality\
    \ of\n   service; however, it also adds to radio pollution.  This is one\n   example\
    \ of the balancing act required when devising radio access\n   network architecture.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Encryption Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Encryption Deployment Considerations\n   Encryption across the Internet\
    \ is on the rise.  However, some\n   organizations and individuals that are mainly\
    \ driven by commercial\n   perspectives come across a common set of operational\
    \ issues when\n   deploying encryption.  [RFC8404] explains these network management\n\
    \   function impacts, detailing areas around incident monitoring, access\n   control\
    \ management, and regulation on mobile networks.  The data was\n   collected from\
    \ various Internet players, including system and network\n   administrators across\
    \ enterprise, governmental organizations, and\n   personal use.  The aim of the\
    \ document is to gain an understanding of\n   what is needed for technical solutions\
    \ to these issues while\n   maintaining security and privacy for users.  Attendees\
    \ commented that\n   worthwhile additions would be different business environments\
    \ (e.g.,\n   cloud environments) and service chaining.  Incident monitoring in\n\
    \   particular was noted as a difficult issue to solve given the use of\n   URLs\
    \ in today's incident monitoring middleware.\n   Some of these impacts to mobile\
    \ networks can be resolved using\n   different methods, and the [NETWORK_MANAGEMENT]\
    \ document details\n   these methods.  The document focuses heavily on methods\
    \ to manage\n   network traffic without breaching user privacy and security.\n\
    \   By reviewing encryption deployment issues and the alternative methods\n  \
    \ of network management, MaRNEW attendees were made aware of the issues\n   that\
    \ affect radio networks, the deployment issues that are solvable\n   and require\
    \ no further action, and those issues that have not yet\n   been solved but should\
    \ be addressed within the workshop.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Awareness of User Choice (Privacy)
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Awareness of User Choice (Privacy)\n   Some solutions intended to improve\
    \ delivery of encrypted content\n   could affect some or all of the privacy benefits\
    \ that encryption\n   provides.  Understanding user needs and desires for privacy\
    \ is\n   therefore important when designing these solutions.\n   From a then-current\
    \ study [Pew2014], 64% of users said concerns over\n   privacy have increased,\
    \ and 67% of mobile Internet users would like\n   to do more to protect their\
    \ privacy.  The World Wide Web Consortium\n   (W3C) and IETF have both responded\
    \ to user desires for better privacy\n   by recommending encryption for new protocols\
    \ and web technologies.\n   Within the W3C, new security standards are emerging,\
    \ and the design\n   principles for HTML maintain that users are the stakeholders\
    \ with the\n   highest priority, followed by implementors and other stakeholders,\n\
    \   which further enforces the \"user first\" principle.  Users also have\n  \
    \ certain security expectations from particular contexts and sometimes\n   use\
    \ new technologies to further protect their privacy, even if those\n   technologies\
    \ weren't initially developed for that purpose.\n   Operators may deploy technologies\
    \ that can either impact user privacy\n   without being aware of those privacy\
    \ implications or incorrectly\n   assume that the benefits users gain from the\
    \ new technology outweigh\n   the loss of privacy.  If these technologies are\
    \ necessary, they\n   should be opt in.\n   Internet stakeholders should understand\
    \ the priority of other\n   stakeholders.  Users should be considered the first\
    \ priority.  Other\n   stakeholders include implementors, developers, advertisers,\n\
    \   operators, and other ISPs.  Some technologies, such as cookie use and\n  \
    \ JavaScript injection, have been abused by these parties.  This has\n   caused\
    \ some developers to encrypt content to circumvent these\n   technologies that\
    \ are seen as intrusive or bad for user privacy.\n   If users and content providers\
    \ are to opt in to network management\n   services with negative privacy impacts,\
    \ they should see clear value\n   from using these services and understand the\
    \ impacts of using these\n   services.  Users should also have easy abilities\
    \ to opt out.  Some\n   users will always automatically click through consent\
    \ requests, so\n   any model relying on explicit consent is flawed for these users.\n\
    \   Understanding the extent of \"auto click-through\" may improve\n   decisions\
    \ about the use of consent requests in the future.  One model\n   (Cooperative\
    \ Traffic Management) works as an agent of the user; by\n   opting in, metadata\
    \ can be shared.  Issues with this involve trust\n   only being applied at endpoints.\n"

  - "3.  Network or Transport Solution Sessions\n   Network or Transport Solution\
    \ Sessions discussed proposed solutions\n   for managing encrypted traffic on\

    \ this sharing takes place\n   from the endpoint to the network, from the network\
    \ to the endpoint,\n   or cooperatively in both directions.  Transport-layer protocol\n\
    \   evolution could be another approach to solve some of the issues radio\n  \
    \ access networks experience, which cause them to rely on network\n   management\
    \ middleboxes.  By removing problems at the transport layer,\n   reliance on expensive\

    \ although additional work on\n      MTG is still required.\n   o  Session Protocol\
    \ for User Datagrams [SPUD]: a UDP-based\n      encapsulation protocol to allow\
    \ explicit cooperation with\n      middleboxes while using, new encrypted transport\
    \ protocols.\n   o  Network Status API: an API for operators to share congestion\n\
    \      status or the state of a cell before an application starts sending\n  \
    \    data that could allow applications to change their behavior.\n   o  Traffic\
    \ Classification: classifying traffic and adding these\n      classifications\
    \ as metadata for analysis throughout the network.\n      This idea has trust\
    \ and privacy implications.\n   o  Congestion Exposure [CONEX]: a mechanism where\
    \ senders inform the\n      network about the congestion encountered by previous\
    \ packets on\n      the same flow, in-band at the IP layer.\n   o  Latency versus\
    \ Bandwidth: a bit that allows the content provider\n      to indicate whether\
    \ higher bandwidth or lower latency is of\n      greater priority and allows the\
    \ network to react based on that\n      indication.  Where this bit resides in\
    \ the protocol stack and how\n      it is authenticated would need to be decided.\n\
    \   o  No Network Management Tools: disabling all network management\n      tools\
    \ from the network and relying only on end-to-end protocols to\n      manage congestion.\n\
    \   o  Flow Queue Controlled Delay (FQ-CoDel) [FLOWQUEUE]: a hybrid\n      packet\
    \ scheduler / Active Queue Management (AQM) [RFC7567]\n      algorithm aiming\
    \ to reduce bufferbloat and latency.  FQ-CoDel\n      manages packets from multiple\
    \ flows and reduces the impact of\n      head-of-line blocking from bursty traffic.\n\
    \   Some of these suggestions rely on signaling from network elements to\n   endpoints.\
    \  Others aim to create \"hop-by-hop\" solutions, which could\n   be more aligned\
    \ with how congestion is managed today but with greater\n   privacy implications.\n\
    \   Still others rely on signaling from endpoints to network elements.\n   Some\
    \ of these rely on implicit signaling and others on explicit\n   signaling.  Some\
    \ workshop attendees agreed that relying on\n   applications to explicitly declare\
    \ the quality of service they\n   require was not a good path forward given the\
    \ lack of success with\n   this model in the past.\n"

  - "3.1.1.  Competition, Cooperation, and Mobile Network Complexities\n   One of\
    \ the larger issues in sharing data about the problems\n   encountered with encrypted\
    \ traffic in wireless networks is the matter\n   of competition; network operators\
    \ are reluctant to relinquish data\n   about their own networks because it contains\
    \ information that is\n   valuable to competitors, and application providers wish\
    \ to protect\n   their users and reveal as little information as possible to the\n\
    \   network.  Some people think that if middleboxes were authenticated\n   and\
    \ invoked explicitly, this would be an improvement over current\n   transparent\
    \ middleboxes that intercept traffic without endpoint\n   consent.  Some workshop\
    \ attendees suggested any exchange of\n   information should be bidirectional\
    \ in an effort to improve\n   cooperation between the elements.  A robust incentive\
    \ framework could\n   provide a solution to these issues or at least help mitigate\
    \ them.\n   The radio access network is complex because it must deal with a\n\
    \   number of conflicting demands.  Base stations reflect this\n   environment,\
    \ and information within these base stations can be of\n   value to other entities\
    \ on the path.  Some workshop participants\n   thought solutions for managing\
    \ congestion on radio networks should\n   involve the base station if possible.\
    \  For instance, understanding\n   how the radio resource controller and AQM [RFC7567]\
    \ interact (or\n   don't interact) could provide valuable information for solving\n\
    \   issues.  Although many workshop attendees agreed that even though\n   there\
    \ is a need to understand the base station, not all agreed that\n   the base station\
    \ should be part of a future solution.\n   Some suggested solutions were based\
    \ on network categorization and on\n   providing this information to the protocols\
    \ or endpoints.  Completely\n   categorizing radio networks could be impossible\
    \ due to their\n   complexity, but categorizing essential network properties could\
    \ be\n   possible and valuable.\n"
- title: '4.  Transport Layer: Issues, Optimization, and Solutions'
  contents:
  - "4.  Transport Layer: Issues, Optimization, and Solutions\n   TCP has been the\
    \ dominant transport protocol since TCP/IP replaced\n   the Network Control Protocol\
    \ (NCP) on the ARPANET in March 1983.  TCP\n   was originally devised to work\
    \ on a specific network model that did\n   not anticipate the high error rates\
    \ and highly variable available\n   bandwidth scenarios experienced on modern\
    \ radio access networks.\n   Furthermore, new network elements have been introduced\
    \ (NATs and\n   network devices with large buffers creating bufferbloat), and\n\
    \   considerable peer-to-peer traffic is competing with traditional\n   client-server\
    \ traffic.  Consequently, the transport layer today has\n   requirements beyond\
    \ what TCP was designed to meet.  TCP has other\n   issues as well; too many services\
    \ rely on TCP and only TCP, blocking\n   deployment of new transport protocols\
    \ like the Stream Control\n   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and Datagram Congestion\
    \ Control Protocol\n   (DCCP).  This means that true innovation on the transport\
    \ layer\n   becomes difficult because deployment issues are more complicated than\n\
    \   just building a new protocol.\n   The IETF is trying to solve these issues\
    \ through the IAB's IP Stack\n   Evolution program, and the first step in this\
    \ program is to collect\n   data.  Network and content providers can provide data\
    \ including: the\n   cost of encryption, the advantages of network management\
    \ tools, the\n   deployment of protocols, and the effects when network management\n\
    \   tools are disabled.  For mostly competitive reasons, network\n   operators\
    \ do not tend to reveal network information and so are\n   unlikely to donate\
    \ this information freely to the IETF.  The GSMA is\n   in a position to try to\
    \ collect this data and anonymize it before\n   bringing it to IETF, which should\
    \ alleviate the network operator\n   worries but still provide IETF with some\
    \ usable data.\n   Although congestion is only detected when packet loss is encountered\n\
    \   and better methods based on detecting congestion would be beneficial,\n  \
    \ a considerable amount of work has already been done on TCP,\n   especially innovation\
    \ in bandwidth management and congestion control.\n   Furthermore, although the\
    \ deficiencies of TCP are often considered\n   key issues in the evolution of\
    \ the Internet protocol stack, the main\n   route to resolve these issues may\
    \ not be a new TCP, but an evolved\n   stack.  Some workshop participants suggested\
    \ that SPUD [SPUD] and\n   Information-Centric Networking (ICN) [RFC7476] may\
    \ help here.  Quick\n   UDP Internet Connection [QUIC] engineers stated that the\
    \ problems\n   solved by QUIC are general problems, rather than TCP issues.  This\n\
    \   view was not shared by all attendees of the workshop.  Moreover, TCP\n   has\
    \ had some improvements in the last few years, which may mean some\n   of the\
    \ network lower layers should be investigated to see whether\n   improvements\
    \ can be made.\n"
- title: 5.  Application-Layer Optimization, Caching, and CDNs
  contents:
  - "5.  Application-Layer Optimization, Caching, and CDNs\n   Many discussions on\
    \ the effects of encrypted traffic on radio access\n   networks happen between\
    \ implementers and the network operators.  This\n   session aimed to gather the\
    \ opinions of the content and caching\n   providers regarding their experiences\
    \ running over mobile networks,\n   the quality of experience their users expect,\
    \ and the content and\n   caching that providers would like to achieve by working\
    \ with or using\n   the mobile network.\n   Content providers explained how even\
    \ though this workshop cited\n   encrypted data over radio access networks as\
    \ the main issue, the real\n   issue is network management generally, and all\
    \ actors (applications\n   providers, networks, and devices) need to work together\
    \ to overcome\n   these general network management issues.  Content providers\
    \ explained\n   how they assume the mobile networks are standards compliant. \
    \ When\n   the network is not standards compliant (e.g., using non-standards-\n\
    \   compliant intermediaries), content providers can experience real\n   costs\
    \ as users contact their support centers to report issues that\n   are difficult\
    \ to test for and resolve.\n   Content providers cited other common issues concerning\
    \ data traffic\n   over mobile networks.  Data subscription limits (known as \"\
    caps\")\n   cause issues for users; users are confused about how data caps work\n\
    \   or are unsure how expensive media is and how much data it consumes.\n   Developers\
    \ build products on networks not indicative of the networks\n   their customers\
    \ are using, and not every organization has the\n   finances to build a caching\
    \ infrastructure.\n   Strongly related to content providers, content owners consider\
    \ CDNs\n   to be trusted deliverers of content, and CDNs have shown great\n  \
    \ success in fixed networks.  Now that more traffic is moving to mobile\n   networks,\
    \ there is a need to place caches near the user at the edge\n   of the mobile\
    \ network.  Placing caches at the edge of the mobile\n   network is a solution,\
    \ but it requires standards developed by content\n   providers and mobile network\
    \ operators.  The IETF's CDN\n   Interconnection [CDNI] Working Group aims to\
    \ allow global CDNs to\n   interoperate with mobile CDNs, but this causes huge\
    \ issues for the\n   caching of encrypted data between these CDNs.  Some CDNs\
    \ are\n   experimenting with approaches like \"Keyless SSL\" [KeylessSSL] to\n\
    \   enable safer storage of content without passing private keys to the\n   CDN.\
    \  Blind Caching [BLIND_CACHING] is another proposal aimed at\n   caching encrypted\
    \ content closer to the user and managing the\n   authentication at the original\
    \ content provider servers.\n   At the end of the session, each panelist was asked\
    \ to identify one\n   key collaborative work item.  Work items named were: evolving\
    \ to\n   cache encrypted content, using one bit for latency / bandwidth trade-\n\
    \   off (explained below), better collaboration between the network and\n   application,\
    \ better metrics to aid troubleshooting and innovation,\n   and indications from\
    \ the network to allow the application to adapt.\n"
- title: 6.  Technical Analysis and Response to Potential Regulatory Reaction
  contents:
  - "6.  Technical Analysis and Response to Potential Regulatory Reaction\n   This\
    \ session was conducted under the Chatham House Rule.  The session\n   aimed to\
    \ discuss regulatory and political issues, but not their worth\n   or need, and\
    \ to understand the laws that exist and how technologists\n   can properly respond\
    \ to them.\n   Mobile networks are regulated; compliance is mandatory and can\
    \ incur\n   costs on the mobile network operator, while non-compliance can result\n\
    \   in service license revocation in some nations.  Regulation does vary\n   geographically.\
    \  Some regulations are court orders and others are\n   self-imposed regulations,\
    \ for example, \"block lists\" of websites such\n   as the Internet Watch Foundation\
    \ [IWF] list.  Operators are not\n   expected to decrypt sites, so those encrypted\
    \ sites will not be\n   blocked because of content.\n   Parental-control-type\
    \ filters also exist on the network and are\n   easily bypassed today, vastly\
    \ limiting their effectiveness.  Better\n   solutions would allow for users to\
    \ easily set these restrictions\n   themselves.  Other regulations are also hard\
    \ to meet, such as user\n   data patterns, or will become harder to collect, such\
    \ as Internet of\n   Things (IoT) cases.  Most attendees agreed that if a government\n\
    \   cannot get information it needs (and is legally entitled to have)\n   from\
    \ network operators, they will approach content providers.  Some\n   governments\
    \ are aware of the impact of encryption and are working\n   with, or trying to\
    \ work with, content providers.  The IAB has\n   concluded that blocking and filtering\
    \ can be done at the endpoints of\n   the communication.\n   Not all of these\
    \ regulations apply to the Internet, and the Internet\n   community is not always\
    \ aware of their existence.  Collectively, the\n   Internet community can work\
    \ with GSMA and 3GPP and act together to\n   alleviate the risk imposed by encrypted\
    \ traffic.  Some participants\n   expressed concern that governments might require\
    \ operators to provide\n   information that they no longer have the ability to\
    \ provide because\n   previously unencrypted traffic is now being encrypted, and\
    \ this might\n   expose operators to new liability, but no specific examples were\n\
    \   given during the workshop.  A suggestion from some attendees was that\n  \
    \ if any new technical solutions are necessary, they should easily be\n   \"switched\
    \ off\".\n   Some mobile network operators are producing transparency reports\n\
    \   covering regulations including lawful intercept.  Operators who have\n   done\
    \ this already are encouraging others to do the same.\n"
- title: 7.  Suggested Principles and Solutions
  contents:
  - "7.  Suggested Principles and Solutions\n   Based on the talks and discussions\
    \ throughout the workshop, a set of\n   suggested principles and solutions has\
    \ been collected.  This is not\n   an exhaustive list, and no attempt was made\
    \ to come to consensus\n   during the workshop, so there are likely at least some\
    \ participants\n   who would not agree with any particular principle listed below.\
    \  The\n   list is a union of participant thinking, not an intersection.\n   o\
    \  Encrypted Traffic: Any solution should encourage and support\n      encrypted\
    \ traffic.\n   o  Flexibility: Radio access network qualities vary vastly, and\
    \ the\n      network needs of content can differ significantly, so any new\n \
    \     solution should be flexible across either the network type,\n      content\
    \ type, or both.\n   o  Privacy: New solutions should not introduce new ways for\n\
    \      information to be discovered and attributed to individual users.\n   o\
    \  Minimum data only for collaborative work: User data, application\n      data,\
    \ and network data all need protection, so new solutions\n      should use minimal\
    \ information to make a working solution.\n   A collection of solutions suggested\
    \ by various participants during\n   the workshop is given below.  Inclusion in\
    \ this list does not imply\n   that other workshop participants agreed.  Again,\
    \ the list is a union\n   of proposed solutions, not an intersection.\n   o  Evolving\
    \ TCP or evolution on the transport layer: This could take\n      a number of\
    \ forms, and some of this work is already underway\n      within the IETF.\n \
    \  o  Congestion Control: Many attendees cited congestion control as a\n     \
    \ key issue.  Further analysis, investigation, and work could be\n      done in\
    \ this space.\n   o  Sprout [SPROUT]: Researched at MIT, Sprout is a transport\
    \ protocol\n      for applications that desire high throughput and low delay.\n\
    \   o  PCC [PCC]: Performance-oriented Congestion Control is a new\n      architecture\
    \ that aims for consistent high performance, even in\n      challenging scenarios.\
    \  PCC endpoints observe the connection\n      between their actions and their\
    \ known performance, which allows\n      them to adapt their actions.\n   o  CDNs\
    \ and Caches: This suggests that placing caches closer to the\n      edge of the\
    \ radio network, as close as possible to the mobile\n      user, or making more\
    \ intelligent CDNs, would result in faster\n      content delivery and less strain\
    \ on the network.\n   o  Blind Caching [BLIND_CACHING]: This is a proposal for\
    \ caching of\n      encrypted content.\n   o  CDN Improvements: This includes\
    \ Keyless SSL and better CDN\n      placement.\n   o  Mobile Throughput Guidance\
    \ [MTG]: This is a mechanism and protocol\n      elements that allow the cellular\
    \ network to provide near real-time\n      information on capacity available to\
    \ the TCP server.\n   o  One Bit for Latency / Bandwidth Trade-Off: This suggests\n\
    \      determining whether using a single bit in an unencrypted transport\n  \
    \    header to distinguish between traffic that the sender prefers to\n      be\
    \ queued and traffic that the sender would prefer to drop rather\n      than delay\
    \ provides additional benefits beyond what can be\n      achieved without this\
    \ signaling.\n   o  Base Station: Some suggestions involved using the base station,\n\
    \      but this was not defined in detail.  The base station holds the\n     \
    \ radio resource controller and scheduler, which could provide a\n      place\
    \ to host solutions, or data from the base station could help\n      in devising\
    \ new solutions.\n   o  Identify Traffic Types via 5-Tuple: Information from the\
    \ 5-tuple\n      could provide understanding of the traffic type, and network\n\
    \      management appropriate for that traffic type could then be\n      applied.\n\
    \   o  Heuristics: Networks can sometimes identify traffic types by\n      observing\
    \ characteristics, such as data flow rate, and then apply\n      network management\
    \ to these identified flows.  This is not\n      recommended, as categorizations\
    \ can be incorrect.\n   o  APIs: An API for operators to share congestion status\
    \ or the state\n      of a cell before an application starts sending data could\
    \ allow\n      applications to change their behavior.  Alternatively, an API\n\
    \      could provide the network with information on the data type,\n      allowing\
    \ appropriate network management for that data type;\n      however, this method\
    \ exposes privacy issues.\n   o  Standard approach for the operator to offer services\
    \ to Content\n      Providers: Mobile network operators could provide caching\
    \ services\n      or other services for content providers to use for faster and\n\
    \      smoother content delivery.\n   o  AQM [RFC7567] and ECN [RFC3168] deployments:\
    \ Queuing and\n      congestion management methods have existed for some time\
    \ in the\n      form of AQM, ECN, and others, which can help the transport and\n\
    \      Internet protocol layers adapt to congestion faster.\n   o  Trust Model\
    \ or Trust Framework: Some solutions in this area (e.g.,\n      SPUD) have a reliance\
    \ on trust when content providers or the\n      network are being asked to add\
    \ classifiers to their traffic.\n   o  Keyless SSL [KeylessSSL]: This allows content\
    \ providers to\n      maintain their private keys on a key server and host the\
    \ content\n      elsewhere (e.g., on a CDN).  This could become standardized in\
    \ the\n      IETF.  [LURK]\n   o  Meaningful capacity sharing: This includes the\
    \ ConEx [CONEX] work,\n      which exposes information about congestion to the\
    \ network nodes.\n   o  Hop-by-hop: Some suggestions offer hop-by-hop methods\
    \ that allow\n      nodes to adapt flow given the qualities of the networks around\n\
    \      them and the congestion they are experiencing.\n   o  Metrics and metric\
    \ standards: In order to evolve current protocols\n      to be best suited to\
    \ today's networks, data is needed about\n      current network conditions, protocol\
    \ deployments, packet traces,\n      and middlebox behavior.  Beyond this, proper\
    \ testing and debugging\n      on networks could provide great insight for stack\
    \ evolution.\n   o  5G: Mobile operator standards bodies are in the process of\
    \ setting\n      the requirements for 5G.  Requirements for network management\n\
    \      could be added.\n   In the workshop, attendees identified other areas where\
    \ greater\n   understanding could help the standards process.  These were\n  \
    \ identified as:\n   o  greater understanding of the RAN within the IETF;\n  \
    \ o  reviews and comments on 3GPP perspective; and,\n   o  how to do congestion\
    \ control in the RAN.\n"

  - "7.1.  Better Collaboration\n   Throughout the workshop, attendees placed emphasis\
    \ on the need for\n   better collaboration between the IETF and telecommunications\

    \   was held at IETF 95 in November 2015, which brought the workshop\n   discussion\
    \ to the wider IETF audiences by providing an account of the\n   discussions that\
    \ had taken place within the workshop and highlighting\n   key areas to progress\
    \ on.  Key areas to progress on and an update on\n   their current status are\
    \ as follows:\n   o  The collection of usable metrics and data were requested\
    \ by a\n      number of MaRNEW attendees, especially for use within the IRTF\n\
    \      Measurement and Analysis for Protocols (MAP) Research Group; this\n   \
    \   data has been difficult to collect due to the closed nature of\n      mobile\
    \ network operators.\n   o  Understanding impediments to protocol stack evolution\
    \ has\n      continued within the IAB's IP Stack Evolution program and\n     \
    \ throughout transport-related IETF working groups such as the\n      Transport\
    \ Area Working Group (TSVWG).\n   o  The Mobile Throughput Guidance document [MTG]\
    \ has entered into a\n      testing and data collection phase, although further\
    \ advancements\n      in transport technologies (QUIC, among others) may have\
    \ stalled\n      efforts in TCP-related proposals.\n   o  Work on proposals for\
    \ caching encrypted content continue, albeit\n      with some security flaws that\
    \ proponents are working on further\n      proposals to fix.  Most often, these\
    \ are discussed within the IETF\n      HTTPbis Working Group.\n   o  The Path\
    \ Layer UDP Substrate (PLUS) BOF at IETF 96 in July 2016\n      did not result\
    \ in the formation of a working group, as attendees\n      expressed concern on\
    \ the privacy issues associated with the\n      proposed data-sharing possibilities\
    \ of the shim layer.\n   o  The Limited Use of Remote Keys (LURK) BOF at IETF\
    \ 96 in July 2016\n      did not result in the formation of a working group because\
    \ the BOF\n      identified more problems with the presumed approach than\n  \
    \    anticipated.\n   The most rewarding output of MaRNEW is perhaps the most\
    \ intangible.\n   MaRNEW gave two rather divergent industry groups the opportunity\
    \ to\n   connect and discuss common technologies and issues affecting users\n\
    \   and operations.  Mobile network providers and key Internet engineers\n   and\
