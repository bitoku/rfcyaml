    \       Version 2\nAs many of you may know SRI is part of a team working on the\
    \ National\nSoftware Works project. In the course of our work we have developed\
    \ a\nProcedure Call Protocol to be used between the modules which make up\nthe\
    \ NSW. We are interested in your comments on this protocol. Please\nforeward your\
    \ remarks to either:                                           2\n   James E.\

    \            2c\nThis note announces the release of the second published version\
    \ of\nseveral National Software Works (NSW) and Procedure Call Protocol\n(PCP)\
    \ documents. Version 2 is SUBSTANTIALLY different than Version 1;\nit and all\
    \ intermediate, informally distributed PCP documents are\nobsoleted by this release.\

    \ is available on-line in two forms: as\nan NLS file and as a formatted text file.\
    \  The Journal number (e.g.\n24459) refers to the former, of course, and the pathname\
    \ (e.g.\n[SRI-ARC]<NLS>PCP.TXT) to the latter, accessible via FTP using\nUSER=ANONYMOUS\
    \ and PASSWORD=GUEST (no account required). Let it be\nemphasised that files indicated\
    \ by pathname of the form\n[SRI-ARC]<NLS>name.TXT are ASCII text files not NLS\
    \ files.                 4\nThe specifications are contained in the following\

    \                              5o1a\nThe document on the Host level protocol,\
    \ HOST, is a suggestion for\nsome restrictions on the regular ARPANET host protocol\
    \ for use in NSW,\nthis topic has little impact on the remainder of the NSW protocols.\n\
    The reader is urged to begin with the major Procedure Call Protocol\ndocuments.\
    \                                                                 6\nThe document\

    \ motivation for the Protocol and states the\nsubstance of the Protocol proper.\
    \                                          7\nThe reader may then proceed to the\
    \ next three documents: PIP, PSP and\nPMP. The latter has the most relavence to\
    \ the casual reader; the\nprogrammer faced with coding in the PCP environment\
    \ should read all\nthree.                                                    \
    \                 8\nThe three documents PCPFMT, PCPHST, and PCPFRK specify low\
    \ level\ndetails of the communication formats and are of interest only to PCP\n\
    implementers.                                                              9\n\
    The documents EXEC, FILE and BATCH describe procedure packages to be\nimplemented\
    \ as appropriate to provide the services of the\naccounting/status/usage statistics\
    \ subsystem, the file subsystem or\nbatch processing subsystem respectively. \
    \                                 10\nThe document RJE-MODEL describes how a user\
    \ would utilize various\ntools in the NSW in the process of  carrying out tasks\
    \ he might in the\nabsence of NSW achieve using a remote job entry system. This\
    \ should be\nread with the document on BATCH.\nThe LLDBUG package specifies a\
    \ debugging package that operates in the\nPCP environment.                   \
    \                                       12\nThe document called BOXES describes\
    \ a mapping between the PCP\nmechanisms and the File Package procedures and the\
    \ Black Boxes needed\nby the Works Manager.                                  \
    \                   13\nThe document TBH speaks to the requirements placed on\
    \ the Tool Bearing\nHost. This document indicates how and where various PCP packages\n\
    interface to an operating system.                                         14\n"
