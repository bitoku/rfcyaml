- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RFC 1240, \"OSI connectionless transport services on top of UDP\"\
    , was\n   published as a Proposed Standard in June 1991 but at this time there\n\
    \   do not seem to be any implementations which follow RFC 1240.  In\n   addition\
    \ there is a growing concern over using UDP-based transport\n   protocols in environments\
    \ where congestion is a possibility.\n"
- title: 1. Use of RFC 1240 Technology
  contents:
  - "1. Use of RFC 1240 Technology\n   A message was sent to the IETF list in October\
    \ 1998 seeking any\n   information on the actual use of the technology described\
    \ in RFC\n   1240.  A number of responses were received, including from the\n\
    \   International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the keeper of\n   the\
    \ OSI protocols.  None of these messages pointed to any current use\n   for this\
    \ technology.  Most of the messages which made any\n   recommendation did recommend\
    \ that RFC 1240 be moved to historic.\n"
- title: 2. Responsiveness to Congestion
  contents:
  - "2. Responsiveness to Congestion\n   Since 1991 there has been a great deal of\
    \ experience with the\n   complexities of dealing with congestion in the Internet.\
    \  Congestion\n   control algorithms have been improved but there is still work\n\
    \   underway to further understand the issues.  In this environment any\n   UDP-based\
    \ protocol is somewhat worrisome since quite frequently\n   people who use UDP-based\
    \ protocols invent their own reliability and\n   congestion control functions\
    \ which may not include the results of the\n   current state of the art.  This\
    \ leads to a dange r of congestion\n   collapse with potentially quite serious\
    \ consequences for the network\n   in which it is run.  See RFC 896 for a discussion\
    \ of congestion\n   collapse.\n   In the case of RFC 1240, the authors seemed\
    \ to assume that if some\n   level of reliability was needed in an RFC 1240 environment\
    \ that the\n   reliability algorithms and the congestion control algorithms which\n\
    \   would then be required would reside in the OSI protocols running over\n  \
    \ the UDP transport.  It is far from clear that any perceived\n   advantages of\
    \ running over UDP would not be eclipsed by the\n   difficulties experienced in\
    \ trying to create a reasonable congestion\n   control algorithm.  Implementers\
    \ would likely find that running over\n   TCP as RFC 2126 describes is the better\
    \ choice.\n"
- title: 3. Conclusion
  contents:
  - "3. Conclusion\n   Due to the lack of use of the technology described in RFC 1240\
    \ and\n   the issues surrounding congestion control in the Internet, RFC 1240\n\
    \   should be reclassified as Historic and its implementation actively\n   discouraged.\n"
