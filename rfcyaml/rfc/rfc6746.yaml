  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is part of the ILNP document set, and it has\
    \ had\n   extensive review within the IRTF Routing RG.  ILNP is one of the\n \
    \  recommendations made by the RG Chairs.  Separately, various refereed\n   research\
    \ papers on ILNP have also been published during this decade.\n   So, the ideas\
    \ contained herein have had much broader review than the\n   IRTF Routing RG.\
    \  The views in this document were considered\n   controversial by the Routing\
    \ RG, but the RG reached a consensus that\n   the document still should be published.\
    \  The Routing RG has had\n   remarkably little consensus on anything, so virtually\
    \ all Routing RG\n   outputs are considered controversial.\n   At present, the\
    \ Internet research and development community is\n   exploring various approaches\
    \ to evolving the Internet Architecture to\n   solve a variety of issues including,\
    \ but not limited to, scalability\n   of inter-domain routing [RFC4984].  A wide\
    \ range of other issues\n   (e.g., site multihoming, node multihoming, site/subnet\
    \ mobility, node\n   mobility) are also active concerns at present.  Several different\n\
    \   classes of evolution are being considered by the Internet research\n   and\
    \ development community.  One class is often called \"Map and\n   Encapsulate\"\
    , where traffic would be mapped and then tunnelled\n   through the inter-domain\
    \ core of the Internet.  Another class being\n   considered is sometimes known\
    \ as \"Identifier/Locator Split\".  This\n   document relates to a proposal that\
    \ is in the latter class of\n   evolutionary approaches.\n   The Identifier-Locator\
    \ Network Protocol (ILNP) is a proposal for\n   evolving the Internet Architecture.\
    \  It differs from the current\n   Internet Architecture primarily by deprecating\
    \ the concept of an IP\n   Address and instead defining two new objects, each\
    \ having crisp\n   syntax and semantics.  The first new object is the Locator,\
    \ a\n   topology-dependent name for a subnetwork.  The other new object is\n \
    \  the Identifier, which provides a topology-independent name for a\n   node.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Document Roadmap
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Document Roadmap\n   This document describes a new IPv4 Nonce Option used\
    \ by ILNPv4 nodes\n   to carry a security nonce to prevent off-path attacks against\
    \ ILNP\n   ICMP messages and defines a new IPv4 Identifier Option used by ILNPv4\n\
    \   nodes.\n   The ILNP architecture can have more than one engineering\n   instantiation.\
    \  For example, one can imagine a \"clean-slate\"\n   engineering design based\
    \ on the ILNP architecture.  In separate\n   documents, we describe two specific\
    \ engineering instances of ILNP.\n   The term \"ILNPv6\" refers precisely to an\
    \ instance of ILNP that is\n   based upon, and backwards compatible with, IPv6.\
    \  The term \"ILNPv4\"\n   refers precisely to an instance of ILNP that is based\
    \ upon, and\n   backwards compatible with, IPv4.\n   Many engineering aspects\
    \ common to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6 are\n   described in [RFC6741].  A full engineering\
    \ specification for either\n   ILNPv6 or ILNPv4 is beyond the scope of this document.\n\
    \   Readers are referred to other related ILNP documents for details not\n   described\
    \ here:\n   a) [RFC6740] is the main architectural description of ILNP, including\n\
    \      the concept of operations.\n   b) [RFC6741] describes engineering and implementation\
    \ considerations\n      that are common to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6.\n   c) [RFC6742]\
    \ defines additional DNS resource records that support\n      ILNP.\n   d) [RFC6743]\
    \ defines a new ICMPv6 Locator Update message used by an\n      ILNP node to inform\
    \ its correspondent nodes of any changes to its\n      set of valid Locators.\n\
    \   e) [RFC6744] defines a new IPv6 Nonce Destination Option used by\n      ILNPv6\
    \ nodes (1) to indicate to ILNP correspondent nodes (by\n      inclusion within\
    \ the initial packets of an ILNP session) that the\n      node is operating in\
    \ the ILNP mode and (2) to prevent off-path\n      attacks against ILNP ICMP messages.\
    \  This Nonce is used, for\n      example, with all ILNP ICMPv6 Locator Update\
    \ messages that are\n      exchanged among ILNP correspondent nodes.\n   f) [RFC6745]\
    \ defines a new ICMPv4 Locator Update message used by an\n      ILNP node to inform\
    \ its correspondent nodes of any changes to its\n      set of valid Locators.\n\
    \   g) [RFC6747] describes extensions to Address Resolution Protocol\n      (ARP)\
    \ for use with ILNPv4.\n   h) [RFC6748] describes optional engineering and deployment\
    \ functions\n      for ILNP.  These are not required for the operation or use\
    \ of ILNP\n      and are provided as additional options.\n"

- title: 2.  IPv4 Options for ILNPv4
  contents:
  - "2.  IPv4 Options for ILNPv4\n   ILNP for IPv4 (ILNPv4) is merely a different\
    \ instantiation of the\n   ILNP architecture, so it retains the crisp distinction\
    \ between the\n   Locator and the Identifier.  As with ILNP for IPv6 (ILNPv6),\
    \ when\n   ILNPv4 is used for a network-layer session, the upper-layer protocols\n\
    \   (e.g., TCP/UDP pseudo-header checksum, IPsec Security Association)\n   bind\
    \ only to the Identifiers, never to the Locators.  As with ILNPv6,\n   only the\
    \ Locator values are used for routing and forwarding ILNPv4\n   packets.\n   However,\
    \ just as the packet format for IPv4 is different from IPv6,\n   so the engineering\
    \ details for ILNPv4 are different also.  Just as\n   ILNPv6 is carefully engineered\
    \ to be backwards-compatible with IPv6,\n   ILNPv4 is carefully engineered to\
    \ be backwards-compatible with IPv4.\n   Each of these options MUST be copied\
    \ upon fragmentation.  Each of\n   these options is used for control, so uses\
    \ Option Class 0.\n   Originally, these two options were specified to use separate\
    \ IP\n   option numbers.  However, only one IP Option (decimal 158) has been\n\
    \   defined for experimental use with properties of MUST COPY and CONTROL\n  \
    \ [RFC4727].  So these two options have been reworked to share that\n   same IP\
    \ Option number (158).  To distinguish between the two actual\n   options, the\
    \ unsigned 8-bit field ILNPv4_OPT inside this option is\n   examined.\n   It is\
    \ important for implementers to understand that IP Option 158 is\n   not uniquely\
    \ allocated to ILNPv4.  Other IPv4-related experiments\n   might be using that\
    \ IP Option value for different IP options having\n   different IP Option formats.\n"
- title: 2.1.  ILNPv4 Packet Format
  contents:
  - "2.1.  ILNPv4 Packet Format\n   The Source IP Address in the IPv4 header becomes\
    \ the Source ILNPv4\n   Locator value, while the Destination IP Address of the\
    \ IPv4 header\n   becomes the Destination ILNPv4 Locator value.  Of course, backwards\n\
    \   compatibility requirements mean that ILNPv4 Locators use the same\n   number\
    \ space as IPv4 routing prefixes.\n   ILNPv4 uses the same 64-bit Identifier,\
    \ with the same modified EUI-64\n   syntax, as ILNPv6.  Because the IPv4 address\
    \ fields are much smaller\n   than the IPv6 address fields, ILNPv4 cannot carry\
    \ the Identifier\n   values in the fixed portion of the IPv4 header.  The obvious\
    \ two ways\n   to carry the ILNP Identifier with ILNPv4 are either as an IPv4\
    \ Option\n   or as an IPv6-style Extension Header placed after the IPv4 header\
    \ and\n   before the upper-layer protocol (e.g., OSPF, TCP, UDP, SCTP).\n   Currently\
    \ deployed IPv4 routers from multiple router vendors use\n   packet forwarding\
    \ silicon that is able to parse past IPv4 Options to\n   examine the upper-layer\
    \ protocol header at wire-speed on reasonably\n   fast (e.g., 1 Gbps or better)\
    \ network interfaces.  By contrast, no\n   existing IPv4-capable packet forwarding\
    \ silicon is able to parse past\n   a new Extension Header for IPv4.  Hence, for\
    \ engineering reasons,\n   ILNPv4 uses a new IPv4 Option to carry the Identifier\
    \ values.\n   Another new IPv4 Option also carries a nonce value, performing the\n\
    \   same function for ILNPv4 as the IPv6 Nonce Destination Option\n   [RFC6744]\
    \ performs for ILNPv6.\n     0                   1                   2       \

    \ specific to ILNPv4 topics discussed in this document.\n   If the ILNP Nonce\
    \ value is predictable, then an off-path attacker\n   might be able to forge data\
    \ or control packets.  This risk also is\n   mitigated by the existing common\
    \ practice of IP Source Address\n   filtering [RFC2827] [RFC3704].\n   IP Security\
    \ for ILNP [RFC6741] [RFC4301] provides cryptographic\n   protection for ILNP\
