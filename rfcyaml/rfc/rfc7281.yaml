    \ the Authentication-Results header field for\n   conveying results of message\
    \ authentication checks.  As S/MIME\n   signature verification (and alteration)\
    \ is sometimes implemented in\n   border message transfer agents, guards, and\
    \ gateways (for example,\n   see [RFC3183]), there is a need to convey signature\
    \ verification\n   status to Mail User Agents (MUAs) and downstream filters. \
    \ This\n   document defines a new authentication method to be used in the\n  \
    \ Authentication-Results header field for S/MIME-related signature\n   checks.\n\
    2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The formal syntax uses the Augmented\
    \ Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)\n   [RFC5234] notation, including the core rules defined\
    \ in Appendix B of\n   [RFC5234].\n3.  \"smime\" Authentication Method\n   S/MIME\
    \ signature and countersignature verification is represented by\n   the \"smime\"\
    \ method and is defined in [RFC5751].\n3.1.  S/MIME Results\n   The result values\
    \ used by S/MIME [RFC5751] are as follows:\n   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+\n\
    \   | Result    | Meaning                                               |\n  \
    \ | code      |                                                       |\n   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+\n\
    \   | none      | The message was not signed.                           |\n  \
    \ |           |                                                       |\n   |\
    \ pass      | The message was signed, the signature or signatures   |\n   |  \
    \         | were acceptable to the verifier, and the signature(s) |\n   |    \
    \       | passed verification tests.                            |\n   |      \
    \     |                                                       |\n   | fail   \
    \   | The message was signed and the signature or           |\n   |          \
    \ | signatures were acceptable to the verifier, but they  |\n   |           |\
    \ failed the verification test(s).                      |\n   |           |  \
    \                                                     |\n   | policy    | The\
    \ message was signed and signature(s) passed        |\n   |           | verification\
    \ tests, but the signature or signatures   |\n   |           | were not acceptable\
    \ to the verifier.                  |\n   |           |                      \
    \                                 |\n   | neutral   | The message was signed but\
    \ the signature or           |\n   |           | signatures contained syntax errors\
    \ or were not        |\n   |           | otherwise able to be processed.  This\
    \ result is also  |\n   |           | used for other failures not covered elsewhere\
    \ in this |\n   |           | list.                                          \
    \       |\n   |           |                                                  \
    \     |\n   | temperror | The message could not be verified due to some error\
    \   |\n   |           | that is likely transient in nature, such as a        \
    \ |\n   |           | temporary inability to retrieve a certificate or      |\n\
    \   |           | Certificate Revocation List (CRL).  A later attempt   |\n  \
    \ |           | may produce a final result.                           |\n   |\
    \           |                                                       |\n   | permerror\
    \ | The message could not be verified due to some error   |\n   |           |\
    \ that is unrecoverable, such as a required header      |\n   |           | field\
    \ being absent or the signer's certificate not    |\n   |           | being available.\
    \  A later attempt is unlikely to      |\n   |           | produce a final result.\
    \                               |\n   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+\n\
    \   A signature is \"acceptable to the verifier\" if it passes local policy\n\
    \   checks (or there are no specific local policy checks).  For example,\n   a\
    \ verifier might require that the domain in the rfc822Name\n   subjectAltName\
    \ in the signing certificate matches the domain in the\n   address of the sender\
    \ of the message (value of the Sender header\n   field, if present; value of the\
    \ From header field otherwise), thus\n   making third-party signatures unacceptable.\
    \  [RFC5751] advises that\n   if a message fails verification, it should be treated\
    \ as an unsigned\n   message.  A report of \"fail\" here permits the receiver\
    \ of the report\n   to decide how to handle the failure.  A report of \"neutral\"\
    \ or \"none\"\n   preempts that choice, ensuring that the message will be treated\
    \ as if\n   it had not been signed.\n3.2.  Email Authentication Parameters for\
    \ S/MIME\n   This document defines several new authentication parameters for\n\
    \   conveying S/MIME-related information, such as the location of an\n   S/MIME\
    \ signature and the identity associated with the entity that\n   signed the message\
    \ or one of its body parts.\n3.2.1.  body.smime-part\n   body.smime-part contains\
    \ the MIME body part reference that contains\n   the S/MIME signature.  The syntax\
    \ of this property is described by\n   the smime-part ABNF production below. \
    \ application/pkcs7-signature or\n   application/pkcs7-mime (containing SignedData)\
    \ media type body parts\n   are referenced using the <section> syntax (see Section\
    \ 6.4.5 of\n   [RFC3501]).  If the signature being verified is encapsulated by\n\
    \   another Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) content type (e.g.,\n   application/pkcs7-mime\
    \ containing EnvelopedData, which contains\n   SignedData), such an inner signature\
    \ body part can be referenced\n   using \"section[/section...\" syntax.\n    \
    \  smime-part = section [\"/\" smime-subpart]\n      smime-subpart = smime-part\n\
    \      section = <Defined in Section 6.4.5 of [RFC3501]>\n3.2.2.  body.smime-identifier\n\
    \   body.smime-identifier contains the email address [RFC5322] associated\n  \
    \ with the S/MIME signature referenced in the corresponding\n   body.smime-part.\
    \  The email address can be specified explicitly in\n   the signer's X.509 certificate\
    \ or derived from the identity of the\n   signer.  Note that this email address\
    \ can correspond to a\n   countersignature.\n3.2.3.  body.smime-serial and body.smime-issuer\n\
    \   body.smime-serial contains the serialNumber of the X.509 certificate\n   associated\
    \ with the S/MIME signature (see Section 4.1.2.2 of\n   [RFC5280]) referenced\
    \ in the corresponding body.smime-part.\n   body.smime-issuer contains the issuer\
    \ name DN (distinguished name)\n   (e.g., \"CN=CA1,ST=BC,c=CA\") of the X.509\
    \ certificate associated with\n   the S/MIME signature (see Section 4.1.2.4 of\
    \ [RFC5280]) referenced in\n   the corresponding body.smime-part.\n   Either both\
    \ or neither of body.smime-serial and body.smime-issuer\n   should be present\
    \ in an Authentication-Results header field.\n   body.smime-serial and body.smime-issuer\
    \ are used for cases when\n   body.smime-identifier (email address) can't be derived\
    \ by the entity\n   adding the corresponding Authentication-Results header field.\
    \  For\n   example, this can be used when gatewaying from X.400.\n3.3.  Examples\n\

    5.  Security Considerations\n   This document doesn't add new security considerations\
    \ not already\n   covered by [RFC7001] and [RFC5751].  In particular, security\n\
    \   considerations related to the use of weak cryptography over\n   plaintext,\
    \ weakening and breaking of cryptographic algorithms over\n   time, and changing\
    \ the behavior of message processing based on\n   presence of a signature specified\
    \ in [RFC5751] are relevant to this\n   document.  Similarly, the following security\
    \ considerations specified\n   in [RFC7001] are particularly relevant to this\
    \ document: Forged\n   Header Fields, Misleading Results, Internal Mail Transfer\
    \ Agent (MTA)\n   Lists, and Compromised Internal Hosts.\n   To repeat something\
    \ already mentioned in RFC 7001, Section 7.1:\n      An MUA or filter that accesses\
    \ a mailbox whose messages are\n      handled by a non-conformant MTA, and understands\n\
    \      Authentication-Results header fields, could potentially make false\n  \
    \    conclusions based on forged header fields.  A malicious user or\n      agent\
    \ could forge a header field using the DNS domain of a\n      receiving ADMD as\
    \ the authserv-id token in the value of the header\n      field and, with the\
    \ rest of the value, claim that the message was\n      properly authenticated.\
    \  The non-conformant MTA would fail to\n      strip the forged header field,\
    \ and the MUA could inappropriately\n      trust it.\n      For this reason, it\
    \ is best not to have processing of the\n      Authentication-Results header field\
    \ enabled by default; instead,\n      it should be ignored, at least for the purposes\
    \ of enacting\n      filtering decisions, unless specifically enabled by the user\
    \ or\n      administrator after verifying that the border MTA is compliant.\n\
    \      It is acceptable to have an MUA aware of this specification but\n     \
    \ have an explicit list of hostnames whose Authentication-Results\n      header\
    \ fields are trustworthy; however, this list should initially\n      be empty.\n\
    \   So, to emphasize this point: whenever possible, MUAs should implement\n  \
    \ their own S/MIME signature verification instead of implementing this\n   specification.\n\
    \   Note that agents adding Authentication-Results header fields\n   containing\
    \ S/MIME authentication method might be unable to\n   verify S/MIME signatures\
    \ inside encrypted CMS content types such\n   as EnvelopedData [RFC5652].  So,\
    \ agents processing\n   Authentication-Results header fields can't treat the lack\
    \ of an\n   Authentication-Results header field with S/MIME authentication method\n\
    \   as an indication that the corresponding S/MIME signature is missing,\n   invalid,\
    \ or valid.\n6.  References\n6.1.  Normative References\n   [RFC3501]  Crispin,\
