  - "ARTICLE II - BOARD OF TRUSTEES\n   Section 1.\n      The Board of Trustees of\
    \ the Society shall consist of not more\n      than twenty Trustees unless and\
    \ until such number is changed by\n      action of the Board of Trustees. Each\
    \ Trustee appointed or elected\n      shall hold office for a term of three years,\
    \ except when some\n      shorter term is specified by the Board of Trustees with\
    \ respect to\n      the appointment or election of a particular Trustee. Only\
    \ Regular\n      Individual Members of the Society shall be eligible to serve\
    \ on\n      the Board of Trustees.\n   Section 2.\n      The Board of Trustees\
    \ is authorised from time to time, to make\n      arrangements for the election\
    \ of voting Trustees by the Regular\n      Individual Members of the Society (as\
    \ defined in Article VI,\n      Section 3, Clause (1), of these By-Laws), such\
    \ that the total\n      number of Trustees shall not exceed twenty.\n      The\
    \ President shall serve ex-officio as a non-voting Trustee.\n      With the exception\
    \ of the President, all Trustees shall be elected\n      by the Regular Individual\
    \ Members of the Society or shall be\n      appointed by the Board to fill a vacancy\
    \ which arises because an\n      elected Trustee has ceased to serve.\n      Any\
    \ vacancy which arises because an elected or appointed Trustee\n      has ceased\
    \ to serve may be fill by appointment by the Board until\n      a new Trustee\
    \ is elected to fill this position for the remainder\n      of the term, in an\
    \ election of Trustees by the Regular Individual\n      Members of the Society.\n\
    \      All Trustees appointed by the Board shall be by the affirmative\n     \
    \ vote of at least four-fifths of the members of the Board of\n      Trustees\
    \ then in office.\n      The Board shall seek to among the Trustees representative\n\
    \      individuals from industry, from educational and nonprofit\n      organisations\
    \ and from government. The Board may also make such\n      arrangements as it\
    \ deems appropriate for the terms of Trustees to\n      be staggered. A Trustee\
    \ may serve additional terms provided that\n      the number of successive terms\
    \ shall not exceed two, except that\n      service as an appointed Trustee prior\
    \ to July 1995 shall not be\n      counted in this computation.\n   Section 3.\n\
    \      All actions taken by the Board pursuant to Sections 1 and 2 of\n      this\
    \ Article II shall require the affirmative vote of at least\n      four-fifths\
    \ of the members of the Board of Trustees then in\n      office.\n   Section 4.\n\
    \      The Trustees shall not receive any compensation (apart from\n      reimbursement\
    \ of expenses) for their services as Trustees, but\n      this shall not preclude\
    \ reasonable compensation for services\n      rendered to the Society by a Trustee\
    \ in some other capacity.\n   Section 5.\n      The affairs of the Society shall\
    \ be directed by its Board of\n      Trustees. The President of the Society shall\
    \ submit to the Board,\n      at least one month prior to the beginning of each\
    \ fiscal year, a\n      budget for the Society's coming fiscal year, for the Board's\n\
    \      consideration and approval.\n   Section 6.\n      Meetings of the Board\
    \ of Trustees shall be held at least annually\n      and at any place designated\
    \ by the Board.\n   Section 7.\n      Special meetings of the Board of Trustees\
    \ may be called at any\n      time by the Board, or by the Executive Committee\
    \ if one be\n      constituted, or by vote at a meeting of the Board, or by the\n\
    \      Chairman, or by the President of the Society, or by a majority of\n   \
    \   the members of the Board of Trustees then in office. Special\n      meetings\
    \ may be held at such place or places as may be designated\n      from time to\
    \ time by the Board; in the absence of such\n      designation, such meetings\

    \   Section 8.\n      Notice of the place and time of each meeting of the Board\
    \ shall be\n      served on each Trustee, by Internet mail or by oral, telegraphic\n\
    \      or other written notice, duly served on or sent or mailed to him\n    \
    \  or her at least thirty days before the date of the meeting, except\n      that\

    \ calendar days notice shall suffice.\n   Section 9.\n      Any or all of the\
    \ Trustees may participate in a meeting of the\n      Board of Trustees, or of\
    \ a committee of the Board, by means of\n      conference telephone or by any\
    \ means of electronic communication\n      by which all persons participating\
    \ in the meeting are able to\n      communicate contemporaneously with one another,\
    \ and such\n      participation shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.\n\
    \   Section 10.\n      At all meetings of the Board, a majority of the voting\
    \ members of\n      the Board of Trustees then in office shall constitute a quorum\
    \ for\n      the transaction of business and the act of the majority of the\n\
    \      Trustees present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall\n  \
    \    be the act of the Board. However, with respect to any action for\n      which,\
    \ under the Society's Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws, a\n      greater affirmative\
    \ vote is expressly required, such express\n      provisions shall control; and\
    \ it is to be noted that such\n      requirements are contained in Article 6 of\
    \ the Articles of\n      Incorporation relating to amendment of the Articles of\n\
    \      Incorporation, and in these By-Laws in Article II, Sections 1, 2,\n   \
    \   3 and 13, relating to certain actions by the Board of Trustees,\n      and\
    \ in Article IV, Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7, involving certain\n      provisions\
    \ relating to officers, and in Article VII, Section 1,\n      relating to amendment\
    \ of the By-Laws. If a quorum shall not be\n      present at any meeting of the\
    \ Board, the Trustees present thereat\n      may adjourn the meeting from time\
    \ to time, without notice other\n      than announcement at the meeting, until\
    \ a quorum shall be present.\n   Section 11.\n      Any action required to be\
    \ taken at a meeting of the Board of\n      Trustees, or any action which may\
    \ be taken at a meeting of the\n      Board of Trustees, may be taken without\
    \ a meeting if a consent in\n      writing, setting forth the action so taken,\
    \ shall be obtained from\n      all of the Trustees; and such consent shall have\
    \ the same force\n      and effect as a unanimous vote, and may be stated as such.\n\
    \   Section 12.\n      Actions of the Board of Trustees, whether taken at a meeting\
    \ or\n      otherwise, shall be duly recorded in minutes and retained in the\n\
    \      Society's records.\n   Section 13.\n      The Board of Trustees, by resolution\
    \ adopted by the affirmative\n      vote of at least four-fifths of the members\
    \ of the Board of\n      Trustees then in office, may designate three or more\
    \ Trustees to\n      constitute an Executive Committee. The Executive Committee,\
    \ to the\n      extent provided in such resolution, shall have and may exercise\n\
    \      all of the authority of the Board of Trustees in the management of\n  \
    \    the affairs of the Society (except for those matters which, under\n     \
    \ the Society's Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws, expressly\n      require\
    \ the affirmative vote of at least a majority, or more than\n      a majority,\
    \ of the members of the Board of Trustees then in\n      office). The Executive\
    \ Committee shall keep regular minutes of its\n      proceedings and shall report\
    \ the same to the full Board when\n      required. The affirmative vote of a majority\
    \ of the members of the\n      Board of Trustees then in office may terminate\
    \ the Executive\n      Committee.\n   Section 14.\n      The Board of Trustees\
    \ may establish such other Committees (other\n      than an Executive Committee)\
    \ as it deems appropriate to facilitate\n      the activities of the Society,\
    \ provided that no such Committee\n      shall take actions reserved to the Board\
    \ of Trustees or to the\n      Executive Committee.\n"
