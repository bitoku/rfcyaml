  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) was\
    \ established\n   in 1996 in Geneva, Switzerland.  FIPA is an international non-profit\n\
    \   association of companies and organizations dedicated to promoting the\n  \
    \ industry of intelligent agents by openly developing specifications\n   supporting\
    \ interoperability among agents and agent-based\n   applications.  The core mission\
    \ of the FIPA standards consortium is\n   to facilitate the interworking of agents\
    \ and agent systems across\n   multiple vendors' platforms.  Since its inception,\
    \ FIPA has counted\n   more than 60 member companies from over 20 different countries\n\
    \   worldwide.\n   FIPA publishes technical specifications, schemas, diagrams\
    \ and other\n   documentation related to the area of Agent technology.  FIPA wishes\n\
    \   to create and manage globally unique, persistent, location-\n   independent\
    \ identifiers for these resources.\n"

- title: 3.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Namespace Considerations\n   As part of the consideration of the URN namespace\
    \ issue, FIPA has\n   engaged in a survey of existing and proposed URN NID schemes\
    \ which\n   might be used instead of applying for a dedicated scheme.  FIPA's\n\
    \   specific requirements are that the namespace should be:\n   -  Globally unique\n\
    \   -  Persistent\n   -  Location-independent\n   -  Reflect the logical structure\
    \ of FIPA specifications (see section\n      3)\n   -  Be purely logical and without\
    \ reference to \"location\" related\n      elements such as (in particular) domain\
    \ names/Domain Name System\n      (DNS) entries such as URLs\n   -  Be managed\
    \ by the FIPA organisation to ensure the integrity,\n      correctness and uniqueness\
    \ of the namespace.\n   The closest to the requirements identified by FIPA were\
    \ the proposed\n   Vocabulary (VOC) [4] and TAG [3] schemes:\n   -  In particular,\
    \ TAG could be used in conjunction with the domain\n      name \"fipa.org\" which\
    \ FIPA has registered to generate unique\n      identifiers. However, the problems\
    \ with this scheme from FIPA's\n      perspective are (in order of importance):\n\
    \      *  It has not yet (to our knowledge) been approved / accepted by\n    \
    \     IESG or IANA (making it inappropriate for use in a standards\n         document).\n\
    \      *  The labels generated related to the time date, owner of the\n      \
    \   label but specify no particular semantics for the content/text\n         of\
    \ the label which would be desirable to identify a hierarchy\n         of standards.\n\
    \      *  The uniqueness in the scheme is DNS based.\n   -  VOC provides a more\
    \ logical structure for a logical hierarchy of\n      specifications but still\
    \ presents the following problems:\n      *  It has not yet (to our knowledge)\
    \ been approved / accepted by\n         IESG or IANA making it inappropriate for\
    \ use in a standards\n         document).\n      *  The uniqueness in the scheme\
    \ is DNS based.\n   In both cases, there is no clear authority for managing the\n\
    \   correctness of the namespace.\n"
- title: 4.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Community Considerations\n   FIPA standards address the area of interoperability\
    \ between\n   autonomous software systems (agents) in open environments such as\n\
    \   company intranets or the Internet itself.  Communication between such\n  \
    \ systems is highly contingent on developers and the systems themselves\n   being\
    \ able to unambiguously identify which technology specifications\n   (interaction\
    \ protocols, languages, domain descriptions and the like)\n   are to be used for\
    \ particular purposes in any given interaction.\n   The use of a managed, unique\
    \ namespace for FIPA specification\n   components would therefore be of great\
    \ benefit:\n   -  To the FIPA standards process: providing unique labels for\n\
    \      individual specification components.\n   -  To developers implementing\
    \ systems based on FIPA standards:\n      identifying which specifications are\
    \ in use in a particular\n      system, allowing them to develop software able\
    \ to flexibly\n      distinguish between different technologies used.\n   -  To\
    \ users of networks making use of FIPA technology (in whole or in\n      part):\
    \ improving the integrity and clarity of interactions in the\n      system, allowing\
    \ them to precisely identify technology\n      requirements for interacting with\
    \ any given software system using\n      FIPA technology.\n   Whilst the assignment\
    \ of identifiers is managed by the FIPA\n   Architecture Board the application\
    \ for identifiers is through the\n   open FIPA standards process - thus anybody\
    \ following the process is\n   entitled to request an identifier for technologies\
    \ they consider\n   relevant to FIPA's work.\n   Final acceptance of any FIPA\
    \ standard is contingent on a vote of the\n   FIPA membership.  Although membership\
    \ is not free (see [2] for\n   details of costs), it is open to any organisation\
    \ with an interest in\n   FIPA's work.\n   The initial plans for identifier resolution\
    \ are to host a web page on\n   http://www.fipa.org to provide for resolution\
    \ of identifiers FIPA\n   will also encourage third parties (FIPA members and\
    \ others) to host\n   more advance dereferencing service or to develop software\
    \ to provide\n   dereferencing where these provide a correct and accurate reflection\n\
    \   of the namespace.  FIPA itself may also engage in such activities.\n"
