On the Naming and Binding of Network Destinations
This brief paper offers a perspective on the subject of names of destinations in data communication networks.
It suggests two ideas: First, it is helpful to distinguish among four different kinds of objects that may be named as the destination of a packet in a network.
Second, the operating system concept of binding is a useful way to describe the relations among the four kinds of objects.
