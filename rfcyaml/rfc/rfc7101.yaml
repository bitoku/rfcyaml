  - "Abstract\n   At one time, the RFC Editor published snapshots of the \"Internet\n\
    \   Official Protocol Standards\".  These documents were known as xx00\n   documents,\
    \ the last of which was published in May 2008.  These\n   snapshots have been\
    \ replaced by a web page, so the RFC Editor will no\n   longer be publishing these\
    \ snapshots as RFCs.  As a result, the RFC\n   Editor will classify unpublished\
    \ RFC xx00 numbers through 7000 as\n   never issued.  Starting with the RFC number\
    \ 7100, xx00 numbers will\n   be available for assignment.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC1083], published in December 1988, was the first document\n\
    \   published in the RFC series that detailed a \"list of documents that\n   define\
    \ the standards for the Internet protocol suite\" and any ongoing\n   experiments.\
    \  Snapshots were published from time to time.  [RFC1280]\n   was the first of\
    \ these publications to be published as STD 1.\n   Starting with [RFC2200], RFC\
    \ numbers ending with 00 were reserved for\n   snapshots of the Official Protocol\
    \ Standards.  [RFC5000], published\n   in May 2008, was the last snapshot documented\
    \ in an RFC.  This\n   document notes that the xx00 documents are being replaced\
    \ by the\n   online resource provided by the RFC Editor, and the tradition of\n\
    \   publishing snapshots is being discontinued.  RFC numbers typically\n   reserved\
    \ for these documents (i.e., those numbers ending with 00)\n   will be available\
    \ for assignment to other RFCs-to-be.\n"
- title: 2.  Online List of Official Internet Protocol Standards
  contents:
  - "2.  Online List of Official Internet Protocol Standards\n   In the past, publishing\
    \ a snapshot of the current list of Standards\n   Track and Experimental documents\
    \ was helpful to the Internet\n   community, as the information was not available\
    \ otherwise.  In 1996,\n   [RFC2026] documented the IETF's desire for the periodic\
    \ publication\n   of the \"Internet Official Protocol Standards\".  However, in\
    \ 2000, the\n   RFC Editor produced an online list that is dynamically updated\
    \ and\n   available to individuals with access to the public Internet\n   [STDS-TRK].\
    \  As the list has been online for over 10 years, and the\n   IETF has indicated\
    \ that they no longer see a need for the snapshot\n   document to be maintained\
    \ [RFC7100], the official list of Standards\n   Track documents will now be provided\
    \ by the online list.\n"
- title: 3.  STD 1
  contents:
  - "3.  STD 1\n   STD 1 has been in an abnormal state since RFC 5000 was published.\n\
    \   After consultation with the IAB, RFC 5000 was published as an\n   Informational\
    \ document, but it was still identified as STD 1 in the\n   document header. \
    \ The status was listed as Informational because the\n   document does not describe\
    \ an implementable Standard.  However, it\n   was associated with STD 1 to keep\
    \ the document consistent with its\n   historic connection to the subseries identifier.\n\
    \   The IETF has decided to move RFC 5000 (and therefore STD 1) to\n   Historic\
    \ status [RFC7100].  Marking STD 1 as Historic will result in\n   the identifier\
    \ STD 1 not being available for future use.\n"
- title: 4.  Cleaning Up RFC Editor Data
  contents:
  - "4.  Cleaning Up RFC Editor Data\n   As part of the cleanup related to ending\
    \ the series of RFC xx00\n   documents titled \"Internet Official Protocol Standards\"\
    , the RFC\n   Editor will mark a number of unused numbers ending in 00 through\
    \ RFC\n   7000 \"never issued\".  All RFC numbers ending in 00 from 7100 upwards\n\
    \   will now be available to be assigned for any RFC.\n"
