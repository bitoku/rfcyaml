  - "Abstract\n   The Generalized MultiProtocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of\n\
    \   protocol specifications has been defined to provide support for\n   different\
    \ technologies as well as different applications.  These\n   include support for\
    \ requesting TDM connections based on Synchronous\n   Optical NETwork/Synchronous\
    \ Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) as well as\n   Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).\n\
    \   This document concentrates on the signaling aspects of the GMPLS\n   suite\
    \ of protocols, specifically GMPLS signaling using Resource\n   Reservation Protocol\
    \ - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE).  It proposes\n   additional extensions to these\
    \ signaling protocols to support the\n   capabilities of an ASON network.\n  \
    \ This document proposes appropriate extensions towards the resolution\n   of\
    \ additional requirements identified and communicated by the ITU-T\n   Study Group\
    \ 15 in support of ITU's ASON standardization effort.\n"

- title: 2. Introduction
  contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   This document contains the extensions to GMPLS for ASON-compliant\n\
    \   networks [G7713.2].  The requirements describing the need for these\n   extensions\
    \ are provided in [GMPLS-ASON] as well as [ASON-RQTS].\n   These include:\n  \
    \ -    Support for call and connection separation\n   -    Support for soft permanent\
    \ connection\n   -    Support for extended restart capabilities\n   -    Additional\
    \ error codes/values to support these extensions\n   This document concentrates\
    \ on the signaling aspects of the GMPLS\n   suite of protocols, specifically GMPLS\
    \ signaling using RSVP-TE.  It\n   introduces extensions to GMPLS RSVP-TE to support\
    \ the capabilities as\n   specified in the above referenced documents.  Specifically,\
    \ this\n   document uses the messages and objects defined by [RFC2205],\n   [RFC2961],\
    \ [RFC3209], [RFC3471], [RFC3473], [OIF-UNI1] and [RFC3476]\n   as the basis for\
    \ the GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol, with additional\n   extensions defined in this document.\n"
- title: 3. Support for Soft Permanent Connection
  contents:
  - "3. Support for Soft Permanent Connection\n   In the scope of ASON, to support\
    \ soft permanent connection (SPC) for\n   RSVP-TE, one new sub-type for the GENERALIZED_UNI\
    \ object is defined.\n   The GENERALIZED_UNI object is defined in [RFC3476] and\
    \ [OIF-UNI1].\n   This new sub-type has the same format and structure as the\n\
    \   EGRESS_LABEL (the sub-type is the suggested value for the new sub-\n   object):\n\
    \   -    SPC_LABEL (Type=4, Sub-type=2)\n   The label association of the permanent\
    \ ingress segment with the\n   switched segment at the switched connection ingress\
    \ node is a local\n   policy matter (i.e., between the management system and the\
    \ switched\n   connection ingress node) and is thus beyond the scope of this\n\
    \   document.\n   The processing of the SPC_LABEL sub-object follows that of the\n\
    \   EGRESS_LABEL sub-object [OIF-UNI1].  Note that although the explicit\n   label\
    \ control described in [RFC3471] and [RFC3473] may provide a\n   mechanism to\
    \ support specifying the egress label in the context of\n   supporting the GMPLS\
    \ application, the SPC services support for the\n   ASON model uses the GENERALIZED_UNI\
    \ object for this extension to help\n   align the model for both switched connection\
    \ and soft permanent\n   connection, as well as to use the service level and diversity\n\
    \   attributes of the GENERALIZED_UNI object.\n"
- title: 4. Support for Call
  contents:
  - "4. Support for Call\n   To support basic call capability (logical call/connection\n\
    \   separation), a call identifier is introduced to the RSVP-TE message\n   sets.\
    \  This basic call capability helps introduce the call model;\n   however, additional\
    \ extensions may be needed to fully support the\n   canonical call model (complete\
    \ call/connection separation).\n"
- title: 4.1 Call Identifier and Call Capability
  contents:
  - "4.1 Call Identifier and Call Capability\n   A Call identifier object is used\
    \ in logical call/connection\n   separation while both the Call identifier object\
    \ and a Call\n   capability object are used in complete call/connection separation.\n"
- title: 4.1.1 Call Identifier
  contents:

    \   Where the following C-types are defined:\n   -  C-Type = 1 (operator specific):\
    \ The call identifier contains an\n      operator specific identifier.\n   - \
    \ C-Type = 2 (globally unique): The call identifier contains a\n      globally\
    \ unique part plus an operator specific identifier.\n   The following structures\
    \ are defined for the call identifier:\n   -  Call identifier: generic [Length*8-32]-bit\
    \ identifier.  The number\n      of bits for a call identifier must be multiples\
    \ of 32 bits, with a\n      minimum size of 32 bits.\n   The structure for the\
    \ globally unique call identifier (to guarantee\n   global uniqueness) is to concatenate\
    \ a globally unique fixed ID\n   (composed of country code, carrier code, unique\
    \ access point code)\n   with an operator specific ID (where the operator specific\
    \ ID is\n   composed of a source LSR address and a local identifier).\n   Therefore,\
    \ a generic CALL_ID with global uniqueness includes <global\n   ID> (composed\
    \ of <country code> plus <carrier code> plus <unique\n   access point code>) and\
    \ <operator specific ID> (composed of <source\n   LSR address> plus <local identifier>).\
    \  For a CALL_ID that only\n   requires operator specific uniqueness, only the\
    \ <operator specific\n   ID> is needed, while for a CALL_ID that is required to\
    \ be globally\n   unique, both <global ID> and <operator specific ID> are needed.\n\
    \   The <global ID> shall consist of a three-character International\n   Segment\
    \ (the <country code>) and a twelve-character National Segment\n   (the <carrier\
    \ code> plus <unique access point code>).  These\n   characters shall be coded\
    \ according to ITU-T Recommendation T.50. The\n   International Segment (IS) field\
    \ provides a 3 character ISO 3166\n   Geographic/Political Country Code.  The\
    \ country code shall be based\n   on the three-character uppercase alphabetic\
    \ ISO 3166 Country Code\n   (e.g., USA, FRA).\n   National Segment (NS):\n   \
    \   The National Segment (NS) field consists of two sub-fields:\n      - the first\
    \ subfield contains the ITU Carrier Code\n      - the second subfield contains\
    \ a Unique Access Point Code.\n   The ITU Carrier Code is a code assigned to a\
    \ network operator/service\n   provider, maintained by the ITU-T Telecommunication\
    \ Service Bureauin\n   association with Recommendation M.1400.  This code consists\
    \ of 1-6\n   left-justified alphabetic, or leading alphabetic followed by numeric,\n\
    \   characters (bytes).  If the code is less than 6 characters (bytes),\n   it\
    \ is padded with a trailing NULL to fill the subfield.\n   The Unique Access Point\
    \ Code is a matter for the organization to\n   which the country code and ITU\
    \ carrier code have been assigned,\n   provided that uniqueness is guaranteed.\
    \  This code consists of 1-6\n   characters (bytes), trailing NULL, completing\

    \ it does not provide\n   capability to support the call model.  A call may be\
    \ viewed as a\n   special purpose connection that requires a different subset\

- title: 4.3 Support for Call and Connection
  contents:
  - "4.3 Support for Call and Connection\n   Within the context of this document,\
    \ every call (during steady state)\n   may have one (or more) associated connections.\
    \  A zero connection\n   call is defined as a transient state, e.g., during a\
    \ break-before-\n   make restoration event.\n   In the scope of ASON, to support\
    \ a logical call/connection\n   separation, a new call identifier is needed as\
    \ described above.  The\n   new GENERALIZED_UNI object is carried by the Path\
    \ message.  The new\n   CALL_ID object is carried by the Path, Resv, PathTear,\
    \ PathErr, and\n   Notify messages.  The ResvConf message is left unmodified.\
    \  The\n   CALL_ID object (along with other objects associated with a call,\n\
    \   e.g., GENERALIZED_UNI) is processed by the call controller, while\n   other\
    \ objects included in these messages are processed by the\n   connection controller\

- title: 4.3.1 Processing Rules
  contents:
  - "4.3.1 Processing Rules\n   The following processing rules are applicable for\
    \ call capability:\n   -  For initial calls, the source user MUST set the CALL_ID's\
    \ C-Type\n      and call identifier value to all-zeros.\n   -  For a new call\
    \ request, the first network node sets the\n      appropriate C-type and value\
    \ for the CALL_ID.\n   -  For an existing call (in case CALL_ID is non-zero) the\
    \ first\n      network node verifies existence of the call.\n   -  The CALL_ID\
    \ object on all messages MUST be sent from the ingress\n      call controller\
    \ to egress call controller by all other\n      (intermediate) controllers without\
    \ alteration.  Indeed, the\n      Class-Num is chosen such that a node which does\
    \ not support ASON\n      extensions to GMPLS forwards the object unmodified (value\
    \ in the\n      range 11bbbbbb).\n   -  The destination user/client receiving\
    \ the request uses the CALL_ID\n      value as a reference to the requested call\
    \ between the source user\n      and itself.  Subsequent actions related to the\

- title: 5. Support For Behaviors during Control Plane Failures
  contents:
  - "5. Support For Behaviors during Control Plane Failures\n   Various types of control\
    \ plane failures may occur within the network.\n   These failures may impact the\
    \ control plane as well as the data plane\n   (e.g., in a SDH/SONET network if\
    \ the control plane transport uses the\n   DCC and a fiber cut occurs, then both\
    \ the control plane signaling\n   channel and the transport plane connection fails).\
    \  As described in\n   [RFC3473], current GMPLS restart mechanisms allows support\
    \ to handle\n   all of these different scenarios, and thus no additional extensions\n\
    \   are required.\n   In the scope of the ASON model, several procedures may take\
    \ place in\n   order to support the following control plane behaviors (as per\n\
    \   [G7713] and [IPO-RQTS]):\n   -  A control plane node SHOULD provide capability\
    \ for persistent\n      storage of call and connection state information.  This\
    \ capability\n      allows each control plane node to recover the states of\n\
    \      calls/connections after recovery from a signaling controller\n      entity\
    \ failure/reboot (or loss of local FSM state).  Note that\n      although the\
    \ restart mechanism allows neighbor control plane nodes\n      to automatically\
    \ recover (and thus infer) the states of\n      calls/connections, this mechanism\
    \ can also be used for\n      verification of neighbor states, while the persistent\
    \ storage\n      provides the local recovery of lost state.  In this case, per\n\
    \      [RFC3473], if during the Hello synchronization the restarting node\n  \
    \    determines that a neighbor does not support state recovery (i.e.,\n     \
    \ local state recovery only), and the restarting node maintains its\n      state\
    \ on a per neighbor basis, the restarting node should\n      immediately consider\
    \ the Recovery as completed.\n   -  A control plane node detecting a failure of\
    \ all control channels\n      between a pair of nodes SHOULD request an external\
    \ controller\n      (e.g., the management system) for further instructions.  The\n\
    \      default behavior is to enter into self-refresh mode (i.e.,\n      preservation)\
    \ for the local call/connection states.  As an\n      example, possible external\
    \ instructions may be to remain in self-\n      refresh mode, or to release local\
    \ states for certain connections.\n      Specific details are beyond the scope\
    \ of this document.\n   -  A control plane node detecting that one (or more) connections\n\
    \      cannot be re-synchronized with its neighbor (e.g., due to\n      different\
    \ states for the call/connection) SHOULD request an\n      external controller\
    \ (e.g., the management system) for further\n      instructions on how to handle\
    \ the non-synchronized connection. As\n      an example, possible instructions\
    \ may be to maintain the current\n      local connection states.  Specifics of\
    \ the interactions between\n      the control plane and management plane are beyond\
    \ the scope of\n      this document.\n   -  A control plane node (after recovering\
    \ from node failure) may lose\n      information on forwarding adjacencies.  In\
    \ this case the control\n      plane node SHOULD request an external controller\
    \ (e.g., the\n      management system) for information to recover the forwarding\n\
    \      adjacency information.  Specifics of the interactions between the\n   \
    \   control plane and management plane are beyond the scope of this\n      document.\n"
- title: 6. Support For Label Usage
  contents:
  - "6. Support For Label Usage\n   Labels are defined in GMPLS to provide information\
    \ on the resources\n   used for a particular connection.  The labels may range\
    \ from\n   specifying a particular timeslot, or a particular wavelength, to a\n\
    \   particular port/fiber.  In the context of the automatic switched\n   optical\
    \ network, the value of a label may not be consistently the\n   same across a\
    \ link.  For example, the figure below illustrates the\n   case where two GMPLS/ASON-enabled\
    \ nodes (A and Z) are interconnected\n   across two non-GMPLS/ASON-enabled nodes\
    \ (B and C; i.e., nodes B and C\n   do not support the ASON capability), where\
    \ these nodes are all\n   SDH/SONET nodes providing, e.g., a VC-4 service.\n \
    \  +-----+                   +-----+\n   |     |   +---+   +---+   |     |\n \
    \  |  A  |---| B |---| C |---|  Z  |\n   |     |   +---+   +---+   |     |\n \
    \  +-----+                   +-----+\n   Labels have an associated structure imposed\
    \ on them for local use\n   based on [GMPLS-SDHSONET] and [GMPLS-OTN].  Once the\
    \ local label is\n   transmitted across an interface to its neighboring control\
    \ plane\n   node, the structure of the local label may not be significant to the\n\
    \   neighbor node since the association between the local and the remote\n   label\
    \ may not necessarily be the same.  This issue does not present a\n   problem\
    \ in a simple point-to-point connection between two control\n   plane-enabled\
    \ nodes where the timeslots are mapped 1:1 across the\n   interface.  However,\
    \ in the scope of the ASON, once a non-GMPLS\n   capable sub-network is introduced\
    \ between these nodes (as in the\n   above figure, where the sub-network provides\
    \ re-arrangement\n   capability for the timeslots) label scoping may become an\
    \ issue.\n   In this context, there is an implicit assumption that the data plane\n\
    \   connections between the GMPLS capable edges already exist prior to\n   any\
    \ connection request.  For instance node A's outgoing VC-4's\n   timeslot #1 (with\
    \ SUKLM label=[1,0,0,0,0]) as defined in [GMPLS-\n   SONETSDH]) may be mapped\
    \ onto node B's outgoing VC-4's timeslot #6\n   (label=[6,0,0,0,0]) may be mapped\
    \ onto node C's outgoing VC-4's\n   timeslot #4 (label=[4,0,0,0,0]).  Thus by\
    \ the time node Z receives\n   the request from node A with label=[1,0,0,0,0],\
    \ the node Z's local\n   label and the timeslot no longer corresponds to the received\
    \ label\n   and timeslot information.\n   As such to support the general case,\
    \ the scope of the label value is\n   considered local to a control plane node.\
    \  A label association\n   function can be used by the control plane node to map\
    \ the received\n   (remote) label into a locally significant label.  The information\n\
    \   necessary to allow mapping from a received label value to a locally\n   significant\
    \ label value may be derived in several ways:\n   -    Via manual provisioning\
    \ of the label association\n   -    Via discovery of the label association\n \
    \  Either method may be used.  In the case of dynamic association, this\n   implies\
    \ that the discovery mechanism operates at the timeslot/label\n   level before\
    \ the connection request is processed at the ingress node.\n   Note that in the\
    \ simple case where two nodes are directly connected,\n   no association may be\
    \ necessary.  In such instances, the label\n   association function provides a\
    \ one-to-one mapping of the received\n   local label values.\n"
