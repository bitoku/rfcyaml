- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memorandum describes a set of MIME types for use with the ISO\n\
    \   Interlibrary Loan Protocol (ISO 10160/10161). Two MIME types are\n   specified\
    \ below.\n   The first is a media type to carry objects which are  BER [BER]\n\
    \   encoded ISO ILL Protocol Data Units (PDU's). BER are the basic\n   Encoding\
    \ Rules used to encode  PDU's which have been described using\n   ASN.1 (Abstract\
    \ Syntax Notation 1) [ASN.1] .\n   The second is for use with the associated document\
    \ delivery\n   instructions.  Document Delivery Instructions (DDI) is an emerging\n\
    \   protocol which enables automatic electronic delivery of items. It\n   allows\
    \ a request management system (which might have received a\n   request for an\
    \ item via the ISO Interlibrary Loan Protocol (ISO\n   10160/10161))  to pass\
    \ details of the request, item, and delivery, to\n   a delivery module, and to\
    \ receive back reports on the delivery\n   process or arrival of an item. It is\
    \ currently being submitted to the\n   ISO TC46/SC4/WG4 committee for approval\
    \ as an ISO standard.\n"
- title: Registration Information
  contents:
  - "Registration Information\n   Media type name: application\n   Media subtype name:\
    \  iso-10161-ill-1 - for BER encoded ISO ILL APDU's\n   Media type name:  application\n\
    \   Media subtype name:  ill-ddi - For associated Document Delivery\n        \
    \                Instructions\n   Required Parameter:  transfer-encoding\n   For\
    \ BER-encoded PDU's or DDI's, the only current legal value of this\n   parameter\
    \ is:\n    iso-8825-ber\n   The transfer-encoding parameter describes the way\
    \ the PDU has been\n   encoded before being submitted to the transport service\
    \ (in this case\n   MIME/RFC822).  The two protocols described in this RFC specify\
    \ their\n   APDU's using ASN.1 (ISO 8824:1990) and the most common way of\n  \
    \ encoding ASN.1 packets is to use the Basic Encoding Rules (BER ISO\n   8825)\n\
    \   The parameter is included to allow future use of these MIME types\n   with\
    \ other encoding schemes. As an example, the ISO 10161 standard\n   also describes\
    \ an encoding method using EDIFACT. In the future, other\n   schemes might also\
    \ be employed. (Since the EDIFACT encoding is not\n   currently in use amongst\
    \ the ISO 10161 and DDI communities, a value\n   for the transfer-encoding parameter\
    \ to describe it is not being\n   registered in this RFC.)\n   Optional  parameter:\
    \ iso-10161-apdu-type\n   Valid values are:\n   ILL-Request\n   Forward-Notification\n\
    \   Shipped\n   ILL-Answer\n   Conditional-Reply\n   Cancel\n   Cancel-Reply\n\
    \   Received\n   Recall\n   Returned\n   Checked-In\n   Overdue\n   Renew\n  \
    \ Renew-Answer\n   Lost\n   Damaged\n   Message\n   Status-Query\n   Status-Or-Error-Report\n\
    \   Expired\n   This parameter is optional and can be provided for informational\
    \ or\n   diagnostic purposes. The value of the PDU or DDI type can be\n   determined\
    \ from the actual data sent. The use and format of the PDU's\n   and DDI's is\
    \ defined in the relevant protocol documents which\n   describe them.\n"

- title: Encoding
  contents:
  - "Encoding\n   Since BER encoded material is binary in nature, some form of encoding\n\
    \   is needed when 7bit or 8bit transport mechanisms are employed.\n   The recommended\
    \  encoding for BER encoded PDU's  is Base64\n"
- title: PDU's per Message
  contents:
  - "PDU's per Message\n   When used to send BER encoded PDU's or DDI's. Each MIME\
    \ body part\n   will carry at most one BER encoded PDU or DDI. However, a single\
    \ MIME\n   message containing multiple body parts can be used to transport more\n\
    \   than one BER PDU and or DDI.\n"
- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   There are no known security risks associated with\
    \ transmitting BER\n   encoded PDU's in general. However, a particular BER encoded\
    \ PDU or\n   DDI may have security considerations that make it inappropriate for\n\
    \   transmittal through public data networks unless appropriate\n   protection\
    \ mechanisms, like encryption, are used. Such a situation\n   might occur, for\
    \ example, when organizations are exchanging documents\n   that contain secure\
    \ or classified information and it is necessary to\n   keep information about\
    \ both the material being exchanged and the\n   exchanging partners confidential.\n"
- title: Interoperability Considerations
  contents:
  - "Interoperability Considerations\n   BER is an international standard for encoding\
    \ data meant to be\n   transferred between two systems that may store data in\
    \ different\n   local formats internally [BER].\n"
