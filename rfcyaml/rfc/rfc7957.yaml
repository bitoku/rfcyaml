- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5727] described processes for evolving and maintaining\
    \ the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] and related technologies\n\
    \   in the former Real-time Application and Infrastructure (RAI) area.\n   These\
    \ processes are collectively known as the \"SIP Change Process\".\n   While areas\
    \ do not normally have \"charters\" per se, RFC 5727\n   effectively served as\
    \ a charter for RAI.  The language in RFC 5727\n   was tightly bound to the RAI\
    \ area and to the DISPATCH and SIPCORE\n   working groups.\n   In 2015, The RAI\
    \ area merged with the Applications (APP) area to form\n   the Applications and\
    \ Real-Time (ART) area.  This document updates RFC\n   5727 to remove its dependency\
    \ on RAI and its working group structure.\n   The updates in this document do\
    \ not depend on the names of the new\n   area, or any specific working group.\
    \  Rather, the authors seek to\n   future-proof the SIP Change Process against\
    \ future reorganizations.\n   RFC 5727 specified that the DISPATCH working group\
    \ assesses potential\n   new work for the area, and determines where such work\
    \ should occur.\n   DISPATCH does not itself take on such new work.  The SIPCORE\
    \ working\n   group is responsible for maintenance of SIP.  Other historically\
    \ RAI\n   area working groups develop extensions to SIP that do not change the\n\
    \   core protocol, new applications of SIP, and other technologies for\n   interactive\
    \ communication among humans.  This document further\n   generalizes the processes\
    \ of the DISPATCH working group so that they\n   can be applied to other areas,\
    \ or to clusters of technologies within\n   an area.\n   This document does not\
    \ change any other aspect of RFC 5727.  While\n   areas and working groups may\
    \ change over time, the rules and\n   procedures for changing SIP and other historically\
    \ RAI protocols\n   remain the same, until such time that they are updated by\
    \ future\n   documents.\n"
- title: 2.  DISPATCH-Style Working Groups
  contents:
  - "2.  DISPATCH-Style Working Groups\n   The DISPATCH working group has proven successful\
    \ at managing new work\n   for the RAI and ART areas.  Areas may choose to adopt\
    \ DISPATCH-like\n   procedures, either for an entire area, or for technology clusters\
    \ in\n   an area or across areas.  A \"DISPATCH-Style\" working group operates\n\
    \   according to procedures similar to those used for DISPATCH.\n   This document\
    \ is not intended to recommend DISPATCH-style groups for\n   any specific IETF\
    \ area other than ART.  Different areas have\n   different needs, and those needs\
    \ may change over time.  It is up to\n   the community and respective Area Directors\
    \ to determine if a\n   DISPATCH-style group is appropriate for any given situation.\n\
    \   The \"DISPATCH-style\" includes the following essential elements:\n   o  The\
    \ working group evaluates proposals for new work for an area, or\n      for a\
    \ well-defined technology cluster.  It acts as a filter for\n      the area or\
    \ cluster to determine whether a proposal is a\n      reasonable use of, or addition\
    \ to, associated technologies.  This\n      determination may depend upon established\
    \ criteria (for example,\n      the SIP Change Process), the experience and expertise\
    \ of the\n      participants, or a combination of the two.\n   o  The DISPATCH-style\
    \ working group determines an appropriate venue\n      for the work.  The venue\
    \ could be an existing working group.  If\n      no appropriate group exists,\
    \ it may develop a charter for a BoF or\n      a new working group.  The group\
    \ might also recommend that a\n      proposal progress as an AD-sponsored individual\
    \ draft, or even\n      that a proposal should not be acted upon at the time.\n\
    \   o  The DISPATCH-style working group does not complete the proposed\n     \
    \ work.  It may, however, adopt milestones needed to properly\n      dispatch\
    \ the work.  For example, it may produce charter text for a\n      BoF or a new\
    \ working group, an initial problem statement, or\n      documentation about why\
    \ certain work was not pursued.\n   Nothing in this list prevents existing working\
    \ groups from directly\n   adopting new work that reasonably fits their charters,\
    \ nor does it\n   prevent new-work proposals from going directly to BoF meetings\
    \ when\n   appropriate.  For borderline cases, the decision whether new work\n\
    \   should start in a DISPATCH-style group or elsewhere is made by the\n   responsible\
    \ Area Directors and chairs.  Likewise, in cases where an\n   area has multiple\
    \ DISPATCH-style groups for different purposes or\n   technology clusters, deciding\
    \ which group will handle a particular\n   proposal is up to the responsible Area\
    \ Directors and relevant chairs.\n   The charter of a DISPATCH-style group should\
    \ make that fact clear,\n   either by referencing this document, or by directly\
    \ describing\n   similar procedures.\n"
- title: 3.  Decoupling the SIP Change Process from the RAI Area
  contents:
  - "3.  Decoupling the SIP Change Process from the RAI Area\n   This document clarifies\
    \ that the SIP Change Process is not bound to\n   any particular area or working\
    \ group structure.  All references to\n   the RAI area in RFC 5727 should be interpreted\
    \ as \"the cluster of SIP\n   and closely related application and infrastructure\
    \ technologies, as\n   well as other technologies designed primarily for interactive\n\
    \   communication, historically among humans\".\n   While the DISPATCH and SIPCORE\
    \ working groups are expected to\n   continue in their current capacities, nothing\
    \ in the SIP Change\n   Process prevents their responsibilities from being assigned\
    \ to other\n   working groups in the future.\n   All other aspects of the SIP\
    \ Change Process are to continue as\n   described in RFC 5727.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document discusses the roles and responsibilities\
    \ of areas and\n   working groups.  It does not create new security considerations\
    \ in\n   the conventional sense.\n   However, organizational structures come with\
    \ their own security\n   considerations.  A DISPATCH-style working group has the\
    \ potential to\n   concentrate the control of work for an area or cluster in the\
    \ hands\n   of a much smaller set of people than those in the whole area or\n\
    \   cluster.  This could effectively create bottlenecks or roadblocks for\n  \
    \ new work in an area or cluster.  Likewise, such a concentration could\n   reduce\
    \ the quality of decisions about new work.  Care must be taken\n   to avoid this\
    \ risk.  The best mitigation is active participation in\n   the group by as many\
    \ people in the area or cluster as possible.\n"
