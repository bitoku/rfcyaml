    \ of the standardization process and the RFC document\n   series is presented\
    \ first, followed by an explanation of the terms.\n   Sections 6.2 - 6.10 contain\
    \ the lists of protocols in each stage of\n   standardization.  Finally are pointers\
    \ to references and contacts for\n   further information.\n   This memo is intended\
    \ to be issued approximately quarterly; please be\n   sure the copy you are reading\
    \ is current.  Current copies may be\n   obtained from the Network Information\
    \ Center (INTERNIC) or from the\n   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)\
    \ (see the contact\n   information at the end of this memo).  Do not use this\
    \ edition after\n   31-Oct-95.\n   See Section 6.1 for a description of recent\
    \ changes.  In the official\n   lists in sections 6.2 - 6.10, an asterisk (*)\
    \ next to a protocol\n   denotes that it is new to this document or has been moved\
    \ from one\n   protocol level to another, or differs from the previous edition\
    \ of\n   this document.\n1.  The Standardization Process\n   The Internet Architecture\
    \ Board maintains this list of documents that\n   define standards for the Internet\
    \ protocol suite.  See RFC-1601 for\n   the charter of the IAB and RFC-1160 for\
    \ an explanation of the role\n   and organization of the IAB and its subsidiary\
    \ groups, the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Research\
    \ Task Force\n   (IRTF).  Each of these groups has a steering group called the\
    \ IESG\n   and IRSG, respectively.  The IETF develops these standards with the\n\
    \   goal of co-ordinating the evolution of the Internet protocols; this\n   co-ordination\
    \ has become quite important as the Internet protocols\n   are increasingly in\
    \ general commercial use.  The definitive\n   description of the Internet standards\
    \ process is found in RFC-1602.\n   The majority of Internet protocol development\
    \ and standardization\n   activity takes place in the working groups of the IETF.\n\
    \   Protocols which are to become standards in the Internet go through a\n   series\
    \ of states or maturity levels (proposed standard, draft\n   standard, and standard)\
    \ involving increasing amounts of scrutiny and\n   testing.  When a protocol completes\
    \ this process it is assigned a STD\n   number (see RFC-1311).  At each step,\
    \ the Internet Engineering\n   Steering Group (IESG) of the IETF must make a recommendation\
    \ for\n   advancement of the protocol.\n   To allow time for the Internet community\
    \ to consider and react to\n   standardization proposals, a minimum delay of 6\
    \ months before a\n   proposed standard can be advanced to a draft standard and\
    \ 4 months\n   before a draft standard can be promoted to standard.\n   It is\
    \ general practice that no proposed standard can be promoted to\n   draft standard\
    \ without at least two independent implementations (and\n   the recommendation\
    \ of the IESG).  Promotion from draft standard to\n   standard generally requires\
    \ operational experience and demonstrated\n   interoperability of two or more\
    \ implementations (and the\n   recommendation of the IESG).\n   In cases where\
    \ there is uncertainty as to the proper decision\n   concerning a protocol a special\
    \ review committee may be appointed\n   consisting of experts from the IETF, IRTF\
    \ and the IAB with the\n   purpose of recommending an explicit action.\n   Advancement\
    \ of a protocol to proposed standard is an important step\n   since it marks a\
    \ protocol as a candidate for eventual standardization\n   (it puts the protocol\
    \ \"on the standards track\").  Advancement to\n   draft standard is a major step\
    \ which warns the community that, unless\n   major objections are raised or flaws\
    \ are discovered, the protocol is\n   likely to be advanced to standard in six\
    \ months.\n   Some protocols have been superseded by better ones or are otherwise\n\
    \   unused.  Such protocols are still documented in this memorandum with\n   the\
    \ designation \"historic\".\n   Because it is useful to document the results of\
    \ early protocol\n   research and development work, some of the RFCs document\
    \ protocols\n   which are still in an experimental condition.  The protocols are\n\
    \   designated \"experimental\" in this memorandum.  They appear in this\n   report\
    \ as a convenience to the community and not as evidence of their\n   standardization.\n\
    \   Other protocols, such as those developed by other standards\n   organizations,\
    \ or by particular vendors, may be of interest or may be\n   recommended for use\
    \ in the Internet.  The specifications of such\n   protocols may be published\
    \ as RFCs for the convenience of the\n   Internet community.  These protocols\
    \ are labeled \"informational\" in\n   this memorandum.\n   In addition to the\
    \ working groups of the IETF, protocol development\n   and experimentation may\
    \ take place as a result of the work of the\n   research groups of the Internet\
    \ Research Task Force, or the work of\n   other individuals interested in Internet\
    \ protocol development.  The\n   the documentation of such experimental work in\
    \ the RFC series is\n   encouraged, but none of this work is considered to be\
    \ on the track\n   for standardization until the IESG has made a recommendation\
    \ to\n   advance the protocol to the proposed standard state.\n   A few protocols\
    \ have achieved widespread implementation without the\n   approval of the IESG.\
    \  For example, some vendor protocols have become\n   very important to the Internet\
    \ community even though they have not\n   been recommended by the IESG.  However,\
    \ the IAB strongly recommends\n   that the standards process be used in the evolution\
    \ of the protocol\n   suite to maximize interoperability (and to prevent incompatible\n\
    \   protocol requirements from arising).  The use of the terms\n   \"standard\"\
    , \"draft standard\", and \"proposed standard\" are reserved in\n   any RFC or\
    \ other publication of Internet protocols to only those\n   protocols which the\
    \ IESG has approved.\n   In addition to a state (like \"Proposed Standard\"),\
    \ a protocol is also\n   assigned a status, or requirement level, in this document.\
    \  The\n   possible requirement levels (\"Required\", \"Recommended\", \"Elective\"\
    ,\n   \"Limited Use\", and \"Not Recommended\") are defined in Section 4.2.\n\
    \   When a protocol is on the standards track, that is in the proposed\n   standard,\
    \ draft standard, or standard state (see Section 5), the\n   status shown in Section\
    \ 6 is the current status.\n   Few protocols are required to be implemented in\
    \ all systems; this is\n   because there is such a variety of possible systems,\
    \ for example,\n   gateways, routers, terminal servers, workstations, and multi-user\n\
    \   hosts.  The requirement level shown in this document is only a one\n   word\
    \ label, which may not be sufficient to characterize the\n   implementation requirements\
    \ for a protocol in all situations.  For\n   some protocols, this document contains\
    \ an additional status paragraph\n   (an applicability statement).  In addition,\
    \ more detailed status\n   information may be contained in separate requirements\
    \ documents (see\n   Section 3).\n2.  The Request for Comments Documents\n   The\
    \ documents called Request for Comments (or RFCs) are the working\n   notes of\
    \ the \"Network Working Group\", that is the Internet research\n   and development\
    \ community.  A document in this series may be on\n   essentially any topic related\
    \ to computer communication, and may be\n   anything from a meeting report to\
    \ the specification of a standard.\n   Notice:\n      All standards are published\
    \ as RFCs, but not all RFCs specify\n      standards.\n   Anyone can submit a\
    \ document for publication as an RFC.  Submissions\n   must be made via electronic\
    \ mail to the RFC Editor (see the contact\n   information at the end of this memo,\
    \ and see RFC 1543).\n   While RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive\
    \ technical\n   review from the task forces, individual technical experts, or\
    \ the RFC\n   Editor, as appropriate.\n   The RFC series comprises a wide range\
    \ of documents, ranging from\n   informational documents of general interests\
    \ to specifications of\n   standard Internet protocols.  In cases where submission\
    \ is intended\n   to document a proposed standard, draft standard, or standard\n\
    \   protocol, the RFC Editor will publish the document only with the\n   approval\
    \ of the IESG.  For documents describing experimental work,\n   the RFC Editor\
    \ will notify the IESG before publication, allowing for\n   the possibility of\
    \ review by the relevant IETF working group or IRTF\n   research group and provide\
    \ those comments to the author.  See Section\n   5.1 for more detail.\n   Once\
    \ a document is assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC is\n   never revised\
    \ or re-issued with the same number.  There is never a\n   question of having\
    \ the most recent version of a particular RFC.\n   However, a protocol (such as\
    \ File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may be\n   improved and re-documented many times\
    \ in several different RFCs.  It\n   is important to verify that you have the\
    \ most recent RFC on a\n   particular protocol.  This \"Internet Official Protocol\
    \ Standards\"\n   memo is the reference for determining the correct RFC for the\
    \ current\n   specification of each protocol.\n   The RFCs are available from\
    \ the INTERNIC, and a number of other\n   sites.  For more information about obtaining\
    \ RFCs, see Sections 7.4\n   and 7.5.\n3.  Other Reference Documents\n   There\
    \ are three other reference documents of interest in checking the\n   current\
    \ status of protocol specifications and standardization.  These\n   are the Assigned\
    \ Numbers, the Gateway Requirements, and the Host\n   Requirements.  Note that\
    \ these documents are revised and updated at\n   different times; in case of differences\
    \ between these documents, the\n   most recent must prevail.\n   Also, one should\
    \ be aware of the MIL-STD publications on IP, TCP,\n   Telnet, FTP, and SMTP.\
    \  These are described in Section 3.4.\n3.1.  Assigned Numbers\n   The \"Assigned\
    \ Numbers\" document lists the assigned values of the\n   parameters used in the\
    \ various protocols.  For example, IP protocol\n   codes, TCP port numbers, Telnet\
    \ Option Codes, ARP hardware types, and\n   Terminal Type names.  Assigned Numbers\
    \ was most recently issued as\n   RFC-1700.\n3.2.  Requirements for IP Version\
    \ 4 Routers\n   This document reviews the specifications that apply to gateways\
    \ and\n   supplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities.\n   Requirements\
    \ for IP Version 4 Routers is RFC-1812.\n3.3.  Host Requirements\n   This pair\
    \ of documents reviews and updates the specifications that\n   apply to hosts,\
    \ and it supplies guidance and clarification for any\n   ambiguities.  Host Requirements\
    \ was issued as RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.\n3.4.  The MIL-STD Documents\n   The Internet\
    \ community specifications for IP (RFC-791) and TCP (RFC-\n   793) and the DoD\
    \ MIL-STD specifications are intended to describe\n   exactly the same protocols.\
    \  Any difference in the protocols\n   specified by these sets of documents should\
    \ be reported to DISA and\n   to the IESG.  It is strongly advised that the two\
    \ sets of documents\n   be used together, along with RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.\n\
    \   Note that these MIL-STD are now somewhat out of date.  The\n   Requirements\
    \ for IP Version 4 Routers (RFC-1812) and Host\n   Requirements (RFC-1122, RFC-1123)\
    \ take precedence over both earlier\n   RFCs and the MIL-STDs.\n          2045-13501\

    \ of Terms\n   There are two independent categorization of protocols.  The first\
    \ is\n   the \"maturity level\" or STATE of standardization, one of \"standard\"\
    ,\n   \"draft standard\", \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\",\n   \"informational\"\
    \ or \"historic\".  The second is the \"requirement level\"\n   or STATUS of this\
    \ protocol, one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\n   \"elective\", \"limited\
    \ use\", or \"not recommended\".\n   The status or requirement level is difficult\
    \ to portray in a one word\n   label.  These status labels should be considered\
    \ only as an\n   indication, and a further description, or applicability statement,\n\
    \   should be consulted.\n   When a protocol is advanced to proposed standard\
    \ or draft standard,\n   it is labeled with a current status.\n   At any given\
    \ time a protocol occupies a cell of the following matrix.\n   Protocols are likely\
    \ to be in cells in about the following\n   proportions (indicated by the relative\
    \ number of Xs).  A new protocol\n   is most likely to start in the (proposed\
    \ standard, elective) cell, or\n   the (experimental, limited use) cell.\n   \

    \   What is a \"system\"?\n      Some protocols are particular to hosts and some\
    \ to gateways; a few\n      protocols are used in both.  The definitions of the\
    \ terms below\n      will refer to a \"system\" which is either a host or a gateway\
    \ (or\n      both).  It should be clear from the context of the particular\n \
    \     protocol which types of systems are intended.\n4.1.  Definitions of Protocol\
    \ State\n   Every protocol listed in this document is assigned to a \"maturity\n\
    \   level\" or STATE of standardization: \"standard\", \"draft standard\",\n \
    \  \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\", or \"historic\".\n   4.1.1.  Standard\
    \ Protocol\n      The IESG has established this as an official standard protocol\
    \ for\n      the Internet.  These protocols are assigned STD numbers (see RFC-\n\
    \      1311).  These are separated into two groups: (1) IP protocol and\n    \
    \  above, protocols that apply to the whole Internet; and (2)\n      network-specific\
    \ protocols, generally specifications of how to do\n      IP on particular types\
    \ of networks.\n   4.1.2.  Draft Standard Protocol\n      The IESG is actively\
    \ considering this protocol as a possible\n      Standard Protocol.  Substantial\
    \ and widespread testing and comment\n      are desired.  Comments and test results\
    \ should be submitted to the\n      IESG.  There is a possibility that changes\
    \ will be made in a Draft\n      Standard Protocol before it becomes a Standard\
    \ Protocol.\n   4.1.3.  Proposed Standard Protocol\n      These are protocol proposals\
    \ that may be considered by the IESG\n      for standardization in the future.\
    \  Implementation and testing by\n      several groups is desirable.  Revision\
    \ of the protocol\n      specification is likely.\n   4.1.4.  Experimental Protocol\n\
    \      A system should not implement an experimental protocol unless it\n    \
    \  is participating in the experiment and has coordinated its use of\n      the\
    \ protocol with the developer of the protocol.\n      Typically, experimental\
    \ protocols are those that are developed as\n      part of an ongoing research\
    \ project not related to an operational\n      service offering.  While they may\
    \ be proposed as a service\n      protocol at a later stage, and thus become proposed\
    \ standard,\n      draft standard, and then standard protocols, the designation\
    \ of a\n      protocol as experimental may sometimes be meant to suggest that\n\
    \      the protocol, although perhaps mature, is not intended for\n      operational\
    \ use.\n   4.1.5.  Informational Protocol\n      Protocols developed by other\
    \ standard organizations, or vendors,\n      or that are for other reasons outside\
    \ the purview of the IESG, may\n      be published as RFCs for the convenience\
    \ of the Internet community\n      as informational protocols.\n   4.1.6.  Historic\
    \ Protocol\n      These are protocols that are unlikely to ever become standards\
    \ in\n      the Internet either because they have been superseded by later\n \
    \     developments or due to lack of interest.\n4.2.  Definitions of Protocol\
    \ Status\n      This document lists a \"requirement level\" or STATUS for each\n\
    \      protocol.  The status is one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\n      \"\
    elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".\n   4.2.1.  Required Protocol\n\
    \      A system must implement the required protocols.\n   4.2.2.  Recommended\
    \ Protocol\n      A system should implement the recommended protocols.\n   4.2.3.\
    \  Elective Protocol\n      A system may or may not implement an elective protocol.\
    \ The\n      general notion is that if you are going to do something like this,\n\
    \      you must do exactly this.  There may be several elective protocols\n  \
    \    in a general area, for example, there are several electronic mail\n     \
    \ protocols, and several routing protocols.\n   4.2.4.  Limited Use Protocol\n\
    \      These protocols are for use in limited circumstances.  This may be\n  \
    \    because of their experimental state, specialized nature, limited\n      functionality,\
    \ or historic state.\n   4.2.5.  Not Recommended Protocol\n      These protocols\
    \ are not recommended for general use.  This may be\n      because of their limited\
    \ functionality, specialized nature, or\n      experimental or historic state.\n\
    5.  The Standards Track\n   This section discusses in more detail the procedures\
    \ used by the RFC\n   Editor and the IESG in making decisions about the labeling\
    \ and\n   publishing of protocols as standards.\n5.1.  The RFC Processing Decision\
    \ Table\n   Here is the current decision table for processing submissions by the\n\
    \   RFC Editor.  The processing depends on who submitted it, and the\n   status\

    \ and for registering concerns\n   in response to notifications (4) to the RFC\
    \ Editor.  Documents from\n   Area Directors or Working Group Chairs may be considered\
    \ in the same\n   way as documents from \"other\".\n5.2.  The Standards Track\
    \ Diagram\n   There is a part of the STATUS and STATE categorization that is called\n\
    \   the standards track.  Actually, only the changes of state are\n   significant\
    \ to the progression along the standards track, though the\n   status assignments\
    \ may change as well.\n   The states illustrated by single line boxes are temporary\
    \ states,\n   those illustrated by double line boxes are long term states.  A\n\
    \   protocol will normally be expected to remain in a temporary state for\n  \
    \ several months (minimum six months for proposed standard, minimum\n   four months\
    \ for draft standard).  A protocol may be in a long term\n   state for many years.\n\
    \   A protocol may enter the standards track only on the recommendation\n   of\
    \ the IESG; and may move from one state to another along the track\n   only on\
    \ the recommendation of the IESG.  That is, it takes action by\n   the IESG to\
    \ either start a protocol on the track or to move it along.\n   Generally, as\
    \ the protocol enters the standards track a decision is\n   made as to the eventual\
    \ STATUS, requirement level or applicability\n   (elective, recommended, or required)\
    \ the protocol will have, although\n   a somewhat less stringent current status\
    \ may be assigned, and it then\n   is placed in the the proposed standard STATE\
    \ with that status.  So\n   the initial placement of a protocol is into state\
    \ 1.  At any time the\n   STATUS decision may be revisited.\n         |\n    \

    \                                         +===========+\n   The transition from\
    \ proposed standard (1) to draft standard (2) can\n   only be by action of the\
    \ IESG and only after the protocol has been\n   proposed standard (1) for at least\
    \ six months.\n   The transition from draft standard (2) to standard (3) can only\
    \ be by\n   action of the IESG and only after the protocol has been draft\n  \
    \ standard (2) for at least four months.\n   Occasionally, the decision may be\
    \ that the protocol is not ready for\n   standardization and will be assigned\
    \ to the experimental state (4).\n   This is off the standards track, and the\
    \ protocol may be resubmitted\n   to enter the standards track after further work.\
    \  There are other\n   paths into the experimental and historic states that do\
    \ not involve\n   IESG action.\n   Sometimes one protocol is replaced by another\
    \ and thus becomes\n   historic, or it may happen that a protocol on the standards\
    \ track is\n   in a sense overtaken by another protocol (or other events) and\n\
    \   becomes historic (state 5).\n6.  The Protocols\n   Subsection 6.1 lists recent\

    \ Architecture Board intends to move towards\n   general adoption of IP multicasting,\
    \ as a more efficient solution\n   than broadcasting for many applications.  The\
    \ host interface has been\n   standardized in RFC-1112; however, multicast-routing\
    \ gateways are in\n   the experimental stage and are not widely available.  An\
    \ Internet\n   host should support all of RFC-1112, except for the IGMP protocol\n\
    \   itself which is optional; see RFC-1122 for more details.  Even\n   without\
    \ IGMP, implementation of RFC-1112 will provide an important\n   advance: IP-layer\
    \ access to local network multicast addressing.  It\n   is expected that IGMP\
    \ will become recommended for all hosts and\n   gateways at some future date.\n\
    \   SMI, MIB-II SNMP -- The Internet Architecture Board recommends that\n   all\
    \ IP and TCP implementations be network manageable.  At the current\n   time,\
    \ this implies implementation of the Internet MIB-II (RFC-1213),\n   and at least\
    \ the recommended management protocol SNMP (RFC-1157).\n   RIP -- The Routing\
    \ Information Protocol (RIP) is widely implemented\n   and used in the Internet.\
    \  However, both implementors and users\n   should be aware that RIP has some\
    \ serious technical limitations as a\n   routing protocol.  The IETF is currently\
    \ devpeloping several\n   candidates for a new standard \"open\" routing protocol\
    \ with better\n   properties than RIP.  The IAB urges the Internet community to\
    \ track\n   these developments, and to implement the new protocol when it is\n\
    \   standardized; improved Internet service will result for many users.\n   TP-TCP\
    \ -- As OSI protocols become more widely implemented and used,\n   there will\
    \ be an increasing need to support interoperation with the\n   TCP/IP protocols.\
    \  The Internet Engineering Task Force is formulating\n   strategies for interoperation.\
    \  RFC-1006 provides one interoperation\n   mode, in which TCP/IP is used to emulate\
    \ TP0 in order to support OSI\n   applications.  Hosts that wish to run OSI connection-oriented\n\
    \   applications in this mode should use the procedure described in RFC-\n   1006.\
    \  In the future, the IAB expects that a major portion of the\n   Internet will\
    \ support both TCP/IP and OSI (inter-)network protocols\n   in parallel, and it\
    \ will then be possible to run OSI applications\n   across the Internet using\
    \ full OSI protocol \"stacks\".\n6.3.  Network-Specific Standard Protocols\nAll\

    \ the protocols listed in this memo are described in RFCs that are\nobsoleted\
    \ by newer RFCs.  \"Obsolete\" or \"obsoleted\" is not an official\nstate or status\
    \ of protocols.  This subsection is for information only.\nWhile it may seem to\
    \ be obviously wrong to have an obsoleted RFC in the\nlist of standards, there\
    \ may be cases when an older standard is in the\nprocess of being replaced.  This\
    \ process may take a year or two.\nFor example, the Network Time Protocol (NTP)\
    \ [RFC 1119] is in its\nversion 2 a full Standard, and in its version 3 is a Draft\
    \ Standard [RFC\n1305].  Once version 3 is a full Standard, version 2 will be\
    \ made\nHistoric.\nMany obsoleted protocols are of little interest and are dropped\
    \ from\nthis memo altogether.  Some obsoleted protocols have received enough\n\
    recognition that it seems appropriate to list them under their current\nstatus\
    \ and with the following reference to their current replacement.\nRFC        \
