  - "                  Proferred Set of Standard Host Names\n   In RFC #226, BBN's\
    \ TENEX list of Host names was set up as a strawman\n   set of standard Host names.\
    \  Comments received since then (an RFC\n   actually generated comments!!!) have\
    \ influenced me to propose the\n   following general rules for forming Host names.\n\
    \   The Host names will be 8 characters in length.  The general form is\n    \
    \                 <site>  '-'  <machine>\n   <site> will be at most 4 characters,\
    \ formed as follows:\n        (a)  Use the keyword in the site name, if not more\
    \ than\n             four characters, e.g., NASA Ames, Case Western\n        \
    \     Reserve.                    ----  ----\n        (b)  Use the standard acronym,\
    \ if not more than four\n             characters, e.g., UCLA, RADC, NBS.\n   \
    \     (c)  If a standard abbreviation exists, use it, e.g., Ill.\n        (d)\
    \  If none of the above apply, use the first four letters\n             in the\
    \ site name, e.g., Burr, Mitr, Harv.\n        (e)  If none of the above is acceptable\
    \ to the site, the\n             technical liaison should select the site mnemonic.\n\
    \   <machine> will be at most 4 characters of the form <mfg. #>\n   <designator>.\n\
    \   Examples of mfg. # are:\n             IBM 360             2 digit model number\n\
    \             IBM 370             3 digit model number\n             PDP     \
    \            1 - 2 digit model number\n             Burroughs           4 digits\n\
    \             CDC                 4 digits\n             etc.\n   <designator>\
    \ will be used when more than one machine of the same\n   type is located at a\
    \ site (e.g., 2 PDP-10s at MIT, at SRI, and\n   at BBN).\n   Limiting <machine>\
    \ to 4 characters does not permit distinctions\n   to be made between machines\
    \ with 4 digit mfg.  #s.  I expect\n   the situation will be handled in an ad\
    \ hoc manner by the NIC if\n   it arises.\n   TIPs are identified as 'TIP' rather\
    \ than by '316'.  If a Host\n   is not to be permanently addressable, the machine\
    \ is identified\n   as 'TEST'.\n   A list of Host names, formed according to these\
    \ rules, is\n   attached.  Alternate Host names should be provided, as\n   suggested\
    \ by Jon Postel (RFC #236).  RFC's 206, 233, and\n   236 present lists with 4-character\
    \ alternate names.  The\n   Technical Liaison should select the alternate name\
    \ for his\n   site and communicate the selection to the NIC.\n   The preceding\
    \ rules and the attached list of Host names are\n   subject to the approval of\
    \ the NWG.  Hereafter, the list will\n   be generated and maintained by the NIC\
    \ in cooperation with\n   the Technical Liaison at each site, as suggested in\
    \ RFC #237.\n   Comments should be addressed to Dick Watson.\n         [ This\
    \ RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n         [ into the online\
    \ RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n         [ direction of Alex McKenzie.\
