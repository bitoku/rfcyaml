- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Efforts to provide mechanisms to distinguish the priority\
    \ given to\n   one set of packets, or flows, relative to another are well underway\n\
    \   and in many modern IP networks, best effort service will be just one\n   of\
    \ the many services being offered by the network as opposed to it\n   being the\
    \ only service provided.  Unfortunately, many of the support\n   functions necessary\
    \ to exploit the mechanisms by which network level\n   service can be provided\
    \ are limited in scope and a complete framework\n   is non-existent.  Compounding\
    \ the problem is the varied understanding\n   of exactly what the scope of \"\
    service\" is in an IP network.  IP, in\n   contrast to connection oriented network\
    \ technologies, will not be\n   able to limit the definition of service management\
    \ simply to end to\n   end connectivity, but will combine service management with\
    \ regards to\n   transport with the service requirements of the actual applications\n\
    \   and how they are using the network.  The phenomenal growth in data\n   networks\
    \ as well as the growth in application bandwidth usage has had\n   the consequence\
    \ that the existing methods of management are not\n   sufficient to handle the\
    \ growing demands of scale and complexity.\n   The network and service management\
    \ issue is going to be a major\n   problem facing the networks of the future.\
    \  This realization is a\n   significant motivating factor in various efforts\
    \ within the IP\n   community which has been traditionally reluctant to take on\
    \ issues of\n   this type [1].  The purpose of this document is to explore the\n\
    \   problems of developing a framework for managing the network and\n   services\
    \ and to examine some of the issues that recent efforts have\n   uncovered.\n"
- title: 2. The Problem of Management Standards
  contents:
  - "2. The Problem of Management Standards\n   Network and service level issues traditionally\
    \ are handled in IP\n   networks by engineering the network to provide the best\
    \ service\n   possible for a single class of service.  Increasingly there is a\n\
    \   desire that IP networks be used to carry data with specific QoS\n   constraints.\
    \  IP networks will require a tremendous amount of\n   management information\
    \ to provision, maintain, validate, and bill for\n   these new services.  The\
    \ control and distribution of management\n   information in complex communications\
    \ networks is one of the most\n   sophisticated tasks a network management framework\
    \ must resolve. This\n   is compounded by the likelihood that devices in IP networks\
    \ will be\n   varied and have differing management capabilities, ranging from\n\
    \   complex computing and switching platforms to personal hand held\n   devices\
    \ and everything in between.  Scaling and performance\n   requirements will make\
    \ the task of defining a single management\n   framework for these networks extremely\
    \ complex.\n   In the past standardization efforts have suggested a simplified\
    \ model\n   for management on the hypothesis that it can be extrapolated to solve\n\
    \   complex systems.  This premise has often proved to be without merit\n   because\
    \ of the difficulty of developing such a model that meets both\n   the operators\
    \ heterogeneous, multi-vendor need and network equipment\n   vendors specific\
    \ needs.  At the center of efforts to devise a\n   standard management model are\
    \ attempts to develop an architecture or\n   framework to control the management\
    \ information. The same conflicting\n   operator vs. vendor forces are present\
    \ in the effort to establish a\n   common framework architecture as are in the\
    \ efforts to develop a\n   common information model.\n   Network operators requirements\
    \ call for a framework that will permit\n   centralized management of the network\
    \ and require the minimal\n   resources to operate and maintain while still providing\
    \ tremendous\n   flexibility in choice of equipment and creativity of defining\n\
    \   services [2].  Operators may be less able to support change in their\n   Operational\
    \ Support Systems (OSS) then they are in the network\n   infrastructure because\
    \ the OSS is tightly integrated into the\n   organizations business practices.\
    \  The need for flexibility, and the\n   other desires identified above, operators\
    \ expect to have meet by\n   having equipment vendors support open and common\
    \ interfaces.\n   Device manufactures have a need for management that will best\n\
    \   represent the features and capabilities of the equipment they are\n   developing\
    \ and any management solution that hinders the ability of\n   the equipment vendors\
    \ to efficiently bring innovation to the market\n   is contrary to their objectives.\n\
    \   The common framework for solving the management needs of operators\n   and\
    \ equipment vendors has been based on a centralized approach with a\n   the manager\
    \ agent architecture.  While providing a very\n   straightforward approach to\
    \ the problem of information management,\n   this approach, and its variations,\
    \ has not proved to scale well or\n   allowed the flexibility required in today's\
    \ modern data networks.\n   Scaling and flexibility are especially a problem where\
    \ there are many\n   sophisticated network devices present.  Methods of control\
    \ must be\n   found that work and scale at the same speeds as that of the control\n\
    \   plane of the network itself if a major concern of the management\n   system\
    \ is with the dynamic control of traffic in a network.\n   Increasingly it is\
    \ a requirement that customers at the edge of the\n   network be able to have\
    \ access to management functionality.  A\n   centralized management approach may\
    \ not provide the most convenient\n   architecture to allow this capability.\n\
    \   Frameworks based on a decentralized approach to the management\n   architecture\
    \ have gained momentum in recent years, but must address\n   the possibility of\
    \ having redundant management information throughout\n   the network.  A decentralized\
    \ framework may have advantages with\n   regards to scaling and speed of operation,\
    \ but information and state\n   management becomes complex in this approach, resulting\
    \ in additional\n   complication in developing such systems.\n   The complexity\
    \ of managing a network increases dramatically as the\n   number of services and\
    \ the number and complexity of devices in the\n   network increases.  The success\
    \ of IP networks can be partially\n   traced to the successful separation of transport\
    \ control mechanisms\n   from the complexity of service management, including\
    \ billing.  As the\n   trend in IP is to allow for classes of traffic that will\
    \ have both\n   transport and service dependencies it has become apparent that\
    \ many\n   of the management problems are becoming more complex in nature and\n\
    \   are starting to resemble those of the traditional telecom provisioned\n  \
    \ service environment.  In the telecom environment no such separation\n   exists\
    \ between transport control mechanisms and service.  The Telecom\n   community\
    \ has struggled for years to come up with a standard solution\n   for the problem\
    \ in national and international standardization bodies\n   and achieved a debatable\
    \ amount of industry acceptance.\n   Unfortunately, the hard learned lessons of\
    \ how to manage the\n   interdependencies between service and transport will be\
    \ of\n   questionable use to the IP community because of the much more limited\n\
    \   concept of service in the telecommunications environment.\n   Rules based\
    \ management has received much attention as a method to\n   reduce much of the\
    \ overhead and operator intervention that was\n   necessary in traditional management\
    \ systems.  The potential exists\n   that a rules-based system could reduce the\
    \ rate at which management\n   information is increasing, but given the tremendous\
    \ growth in this\n   information, the problems with the control of that information\
    \ will\n   continue to exist.  Rules add additional issues to the complexity of\n\
    \   managing a network and as such will contribute to the information\n   control\
    \ problem.\n"
- title: 2.1. IP QoS Management
  contents:
  - "2.1. IP QoS Management\n   Much of the current management efforts are focused\
    \ on solving control\n   issues for IP QoS [3].  A number of open questions exist\
    \ with the IP\n   QoS architecture which will make it difficult to define a management\n\
    \   architecture until they are resolved.  These are well documented in\n   \"\
    Next steps for the IP QoS architecture\" [4], but from the management\n   perspective\
    \ warrant emphasizing.\n   Current IP QoS architectures have not defined if the\
    \ service will be\n   per-application or only a transport-layer option.  This\
    \ will have\n   significant impact both from a control perspective and from a\
    \ billing\n   and service assurance one.\n   The assumption is that the routing\
    \ best effort path will be used for\n   both best effort traffic and for traffic\
    \ of a different service\n   level.  In addition to those issues raised in [4],\
    \ best effort path\n   routing may not be able to identify the parameters necessary\
    \ to\n   identify routes capable of sustaining distinguished service traffic.\n\
    \   In any architecture where a premium service will be offered it is a\n   strong\
    \ requirement that the service be measurable and sustainable.\n   Provisioning\
    \ that service will require a coherent view of the network\n   and not just the\
    \ device management view that is currently implemented\n   in most networks.\n"
- title: 2.2. Promise of rules-based Management
  contents:
  - "2.2. Promise of rules-based Management\n   Management standardization efforts\
    \ in the IP community have so far\n   been concerned primarily with what is commonly\
    \ referred to as\n   \"element management\" or \"device management\" [5].  Generally\
    \ there is\n   agreement as to the scope of element management.  Once outside\
    \ that\n   domain efforts to divide that task along clear boundaries have proved\n\
    \   elusive with many of the terms being used having their roots in the\n   telecommunications\
    \ industry and as such being of potentially limited\n   use for IP management\
    \ [1].  Confusion resulting from the ambiguity\n   associated with what functions\
    \ compose management beyond those\n   intended for the element, is compounded\
    \ by the broad scope for which\n   network and service management standards apply.\
    \  Terms such a\n   business goals, service management, and application management\
    \ are\n   not sufficiently defined to insure there will not be disagreement as\n\
    \   to the actual scope of the management functions needed and to what\n   extent\
    \ interrelationships will exists between them.\n   It is within this hazy domain\
    \ that much of the recent efforts in\n   rules-based management have been proposed\
    \ as a potential solution.\n   Efforts to devise a framework for policy management\
    \ is an example of\n   one of the most popular recent activities.  Proposed requirements\
    \ for\n   policy management look very much like pre-existing network management\n\
    \   requirements [2], but specific models needed to define policy itself\n   and\
    \ related to the definition of policy to control DiffServ and RSVP\n   based QoS\
    \ are under development.\n"
- title: 2.3. Service Management Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.3. Service Management Requirements\n   Efforts to define the requirements for\
    \ a service management system\n   are hindered by the different needs of network\
    \ operators.  In an\n   industry where much has been written about the trend towards\n\
    \   convergence there still exist fundamental differences in the business\n  \
    \ needs of operators.\n"
- title: 2.3.1. Enterprise
  contents:
  - "2.3.1. Enterprise\n   The management requirements from both the operations and\
    \ the network\n   perspective have some interesting characteristics in the enterprise\n\
    \   environment when compared to the public network.  In the enterprise\n   end\
    \ to end traffic management is implemented without the burden of\n   complex tariff\
    \ issues.  Service Level Agreements, while increasing in\n   the enterprise, do\
    \ not have the same operations impact as in the\n   public network.  The high\
    \ costs associated with implementing non-\n   reputable auditing systems are usually\
    \ not present.  This results in\n   a substantial reduction in the number of expressions\
    \ necessary to\n   represent a particular networks business model.\n   In the\
    \ world of best effort service, rules-based management presents\n   the possibility\
    \ to give the IT department a tool the make the network\n   appear to not be overloaded\
    \ by prioritizing traffic.  This is done by\n   prioritizing delay sensitive traffic\
    \ (Web browsing) from traffic that\n   is not delay sensitive (Email) or by prioritizing\
    \ the traffic from a\n   particular location or source.  This will, depending\
    \ on the composite\n   of an enterprises traffic, increase the useful life of\
    \ the network\n   without adding additional capacity.  This does not come without\n\
    \   tradeoffs.  Both the purchase and management costs associated with\n   the\
    \ system must be calculated as well as the cost of the added\n   complexity of\
    \ adding additional control information to the network.\n"
- title: 2.3.2. Service Provider
  contents:
  - "2.3.2. Service Provider\n   It has for a long time been a goal of service providers\
    \ to have a\n   centralized management system.  While the motivation for this\
    \ is very\n   straightforward there exist some fundamental obstacles in achieving\n\
    \   this goal.  Service providers often do not want to be tied to a\n   single\
    \ vendor and certainly do not want to be limited to only one\n   model of any\
    \ single vendors equipment.  At the same time bottom line\n   costs are of paramount\
    \ importance which often result in networks not\n   being as heterogeneous as\
    \ operators would like. Centralized\n   management implies a scalable system able\
    \ to manage potentially many\n   heterogeneous pieces of equipment.  The amount\
    \ of data necessary to\n   achieve this is contrary to the scalability requirement.\
    \  In response\n   to this problem it has been attempted many times to identify\
    \ the\n   common model that represents the subset common to all devices.\n   Unfortunately\
    \ all too often this set is either too complex,\n   increasing the cost of devices,\
    \ or too limited to preclude large\n   amounts of device specific data thus defeating\
    \ the purpose. For such\n   a management model to be successful at the service\
    \ level, the\n   services being modeled must be standardized.  This is counter\n\
    \   intuitive to the competitive model of which the service provider\n   operates.\
    \  To be successful speed to market has become a key element\n   that differentiates\
    \ one service provider from another.  Constraints\n   placed on equipment manufacturers\
    \ and the management infrastructure\n   by a centralized management system are\
    \ also detrimental to this goal.\n   While for a limited set of well defined services\
    \ a central management\n   approach is feasible, such a system can very quickly\
    \ become a major\n   contributor to the very problems it was intended to solve.\n"
- title: 3. Network and Service Management
  contents:
  - "3. Network and Service Management\n   Currently many of the efforts to define\
    \ a framework for management\n   are described in very implementation independent\
    \ terms.  In actual\n   fact the implementation of that framework directly affects\
    \ for what\n   situations the management system will be most beneficial.  While\
    \ many\n   past attempts to define a common management framework have failed it\n\
    \   may be in the area of service management that such efforts finally\n   gain\
    \ industry acceptance.  It may be in the domain of service\n   management that\
    \ information models can be defined that are\n   sufficiently specific to be useful\
    \ and at that same time not have a\n   negative impact on the equipment or service\
    \ providers business needs.\n   This section will discuss some of the issues that\
    \ need to be resolved\n   with regards to a service management framework to meet\
    \ the\n   requirements of the modern IP network.\n   Some of the key concerns\
    \ looking at a management system architecture\n   include:\n      -  The management\
    \ interface and models supported\n      -  The management system architecture\n\
    \      -  Where and how functionality is realized\n"
- title: 3.1. Architecture for information management
  contents:
  - "3.1. Architecture for information management\n   Networks will consist of network\
    \ elements that have existed prior to\n   efforts to define a standard information\
    \ model, rules-based or\n   otherwise, and elements deployed after.  This problem\
    \ has been\n   addressed by some of the recent efforts in policy management. \
    \ Those\n   elements that take into account policy are termed policy aware while\n\
    \   those that do not are termed policy unaware.  The distinction being\n   made\
    \ that aware devices can interpret the policy information model or\n   schema.\
    \  These issues apply equally to other standard management\n   information.  In\
    \ reality it is unlikely that any device will be fully\n   policy aware for long,\
    \ as the policy information model evolves, early\n   devices will be only policy\
    \ aware for those aspects of the model that\n   had been defined at the time.\
    \  Key to success of any management\n   framework is ability to handle revision\
    \ and evolution.  A number\n   methods exists provide this functionality.  One\
    \ is designing the\n   information models so that it can be extended but still\
    \ be\n   practically used in their original form.  A second is to provide an\n\
    \   adaptation or proxy layer.  Each has advantages and disadvantages.\n   Methods\
    \ that attempt to extend the original model often overly\n   constrain themselves.\
    \  Where the existing model cannot be extended\n   new branches must be formed\
    \ in the model that contain core management\n   functionality.\n   Adaptation\
    \ methods can create performance and scalability problems\n   and add complexity\
    \ to the network by creating additional network\n   elements.  A similar situation\
    \ exists if the management framework is\n   so flexible as to allow network elements\
    \ to store locally information\n   or choose to have information stored remotely.\
    \  From a device\n   perspective, the criteria will be if the device can afford\
    \ the logic\n   based on other requirements it is designed to meet, and if the\n\
    \   information can be retrieved in such a way as to support the\n   performance\
    \ and scalability requirements that are the subject of the\n   information.  A\
    \ dichotomy exists where there will be information that\n   for reasons of performance\
    \ and scalability will be transferred\n   directly to the network elements in\
    \ some situations, and in other\n   situations, will exist in the management plan.\
    \  IP management efforts\n   have left the level of detail needed to define the\
    \ actual location of\n   the management information to the implementation.  In\
    \ a service\n   management framework it may be necessary to achieve the desired\n\
    \   results to supply a more complete framework along the lines of detail\n  \
    \ provided by the ITU-T telecommunications management network efforts\n   where\
    \ the interfaces and functionality across interfaces has been\n   clearly defined.\n\
    \   Information will need to exist in multiple locations simultaneously\n   in\
    \ any network architecture.  As the quantity and complexity of that\n   information\
    \ increases limitations quickly develop.  Changes in the\n   information may need\
    \ to be propagated in close to real time, further\n   adding to the complication.\n"
- title: 3.1.1. Rules-based Management
  contents:
  - "3.1.1. Rules-based Management\n   A network management framework can be viewed\
    \ as being divided into\n   two essential functions.  The first deals with the\
    \ aspects of\n   managing the management information while the second deals with\
    \ the\n   aspects of transferring that management information into the network.\n\
    \   The fundamental difference between rules based management and\n   existing\
    \ network management standards is that the management\n   information is expressed\
    \ as rules that reflect a desired level of\n   service from the network as opposed\
    \ to device specific management\n   information.  Many of the information management\
    \ requirements of\n   traditional management systems still apply in a rules-based\n\
    \   environment.  The network is composed of specific devices and it is\n   at\
    \ the point where rules are conveyed as device specific management\n   information\
    \ that this form of management will encounter some of its\n   greatest challenges.\
    \  A necessary component of a solution to this\n   problem will be a generic information\
    \ model to which rules can be\n   applied and a framework architecture for distributing\
    \ rules\n   throughout the network.  The task of finding the proper generic model\n\
    \   that is not too great a burden to implement and yet provides a level\n   of\
    \ detail sufficient to manage a network has proved to be\n   historically extremely\
    \ difficult.  In many ways the degree to which\n   rules based management will\
    \ be able to solve management problems is\n   dependent on the success of efforts\
    \ to define a generic model and\n   have it be widely implemented [1].\n   One\
    \ concept often discussed along with policy deals with the\n   integration of\
    \ legacy devices into the policy framework.  The\n   presumption is that legacy\
    \ devices would be able to participate in\n   the policy decision by having policy\
    \ information translated into the\n   native management interface.  For this to\
    \ succeed a device would have\n   to support a functionality for which policy\
    \ would be specified. This\n   would limit the usefulness of this approach to\
    \ only information\n   logically abstracted to the native interface of the device.\
    \  Given\n   that existing standard management interfaces do not support such\n\
    \   functionality, all such devices would need to have a proprietary\n   interface\
    \ implemented.  The interface being based on the existing\n   interface supported\
    \ by the device would potentially not have the\n   scaling capabilities needed\
    \ for a policy management system.  Unlike a\n   standard network management interface,\
    \ were management information\n   can be distributed between the adaptation layer\
    \ and the network\n   element, rules based management information may not be so\
    \ easily\n   distributed.\n   The framework for integrating rules based management\
    \ system with\n   existing network devices is not readily apparent and further\
    \ study is\n   needed.  The problem exists further when one considers that there\n\
    \   will be early policy aware devices that may not be aware as the\n   policy\
    \ models are extended.  The partially policy aware devices may\n   represent additional\
    \ architectural issues as it may not be possible\n   to expect consistency in\
    \ what aspects of policy a given devices\n   implements if there does not exist\
    \ formal sets of mandatory\n   functionality with clear evolution paths.  It is\
    \ paramount if the\n   policy management framework is going to able to evolve\
    \ to accommodate\n   the ever-increasing number of services likely to be supported\
    \ by IP\n   networks of the future that an evolution path be built into the\n\
    \   framework.\n"
- title: 3.2. Policy Protocol
  contents:
  - "3.2. Policy Protocol\n   The need for a policy protocol is important in the context\
    \ of a\n   policy aware element that is performing a certain 'service'.  It is\n\
    \   important to note here that not all elements will be aware of all\n   service\
    \ policies related to every service at all times.  Therefore it\n   makes sense\
    \ for an element to be aware of a certain service policy if\n   that element is\
    \ required for a given service at any instant in time.\n   With the dynamics of\
    \ a network where elements and links go up and\n   down, a notion of a 'policy\
    \ protocol' may become necessary.  The idea\n   of a 'policy protocol' that runs\
    \ in a multi-service network requiring\n   multi-service policies.  For example;\
    \ consider two arbitrary end\n   nodes having multiple routing paths between them.\
    \ Let's then assume\n   that a certain path carries a certain service based on\
    \ some Intserv\n   bandwidth reservation technique.  Let's also then deduce that\
    \ the\n   elements along that path have some element specific policy statements\n\
    \   that have been configured on them to support that requirement.  If\n   now\
    \ at any given instance any link or any element were to be\n   unavailable along\
    \ that path, the 'policy protocol' should be\n   initiated to automatically go\
    \ and configure the same service-policies\n   on the elements along another routed\
    \ path connecting the very same\n   end points, so that there is no disruption\
    \ in service and so that no\n   human/operator intervention is required.\n   The\
    \ association of policy with the policy target is an area where\n   considerable\
    \ study may need to be done.  Some issues are if this\n   needs to be explicitly\
    \ done or if the policy can be so written that a\n   common description of the\
    \ target is also included?  Allowing a policy\n   target to retrieve those policies\
    \ that are relevant to it.\n"

    \ of implementing management operations\n   based on architectures that may not\
    \ be compatible with existing\n   management systems will still need to be explored.\n\
    \   Given that many network devices in IP networks are making routing\n   decisions\
    \ based on information received via routing protocols it\n   seems sensible that\
    \ they also make QoS decisions in a similar\n   fashion.\n   Historically the\
    \ broader the scope of a network management\n   standardization effort the less\
    \ likely it has been to succeed.\n   Management standardization efforts must be\
    \ careful to have clearly\n   defined goals and requirements less they to experience\
    \ the same fate\n   as previous such efforts.\n   As IP continues to extend it's\
    \ concept of service beyond that of best\n   effort to include, among other things,\
    \ differentiate treatment of\n   packets, it will become increasingly necessary\
    \ to have mechanisms\n   capable of supporting these extensions.  Efforts to define\
    \ a common\n   management model and framework have proven to be historically\n\
    \   elusive.  Information models, whether they be traditional or rules-\n   based,\
    \ must address these past problems.  The desire to keep a\n   competitive advantage,\
    \ and the reality that a common model, to be\n   truly common, will not provide\
    \ sufficient detail to fully manage a\n   device, has often slowed the acceptance\
    \ on the part of equipment\n   vendors to this approach.\n   As IP continues to\
    \ extend it's concept of service beyond that of best\n   effort to include, among\
    \ other things, differentiate treatment of\n   packets it will become increasingly\
    \ necessary to have mechanisms\n   capable of supporting these extensions.\n"

  - "5. Security Considerations\n   The exchange of management information in a network\
    \ is one of the\n   most sensitive from a security perspective.  Management protocols\n\
    \   must address security to insure the integrity of the data.  A\n   management\
    \ architecture must provide for security considerations from\n   its inception\
    \ to insure the authenticity of the information provider\n   and that the security\
    \ mechanisms not be so cumbersome as to make them\n   not feasible to implement.\n"
