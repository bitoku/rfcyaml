  - "1.  Introduction\n   [BCP47] permits the definition and registration of language\
    \ tag\n   extensions \"that contain a language component and are compatible with\n\
    \   applications that understand language tags\".  This document defines\n   an\
    \ extension for specifying the source of content that has been\n   transformed,\
    \ including text that has been transliterated,\n   transcribed, or translated,\
    \ or in some other way influenced by the\n   source.  It may be used in queries\
    \ to request content that has been\n   transformed.  The \"singleton\" identifier\
    \ for this extension is 't'.\n   Language tags, as defined by [BCP47], are useful\
    \ for identifying the\n   language of content.  There are mechanisms for specifying\
    \ variant\n   subtags for special purposes.  However, these variants are\n   insufficient\
    \ for specifying content that has undergone\n   transformations, including content\
    \ that has been transliterated,\n   transcribed, or translated.  The correct interpretation\
    \ of the\n   content may depend upon knowledge of the conventions used for the\n\
    \   transformation.\n   Suppose that Italian or Russian cities on a map are transcribed\
    \ for\n   Japanese users.  Each name needs to be transliterated into katakana\n\
    \   using rules appropriate for the specific source and target language.\n   When\
    \ tagging such data, it is important to be able to indicate not\n   only the resulting\
    \ content language (\"ja\" in this case), but also the\n   source language.\n\
    \   Transforms such as transliterations may vary, depending not only on\n   the\
    \ basis of the source and target script, but also on the source and\n   target\
    \ language.  Thus, the Russian <U+041F U+0443 U+0442 U+0438\n   U+043D> (which\
    \ corresponds to the Cyrillic <PE, U, TE, I, EN>)\n   transliterates into \"Putin\"\
    \ in English but \"Poutine\" in French.  The\n   identifier could be used to indicate\
    \ a desired mechanical\n   transformation in an API, or could be used to tag data\
    \ that has been\n   converted (mechanically or by hand) according to a transliteration\n\
    \   method.\n   In addition, many different conventions have arisen for how to\n\
    \   transform text, even between the same languages and scripts.  For\n   example,\
    \ \"Gaddafi\" is commonly transliterated from Arabic to English\n   as any of\
    \ (G/Q/K/Kh)a(d/dh/dd/dhdh/th/zz)af(i/y).  Some examples of\n   standardized conventions\
    \ used for transcribing or transliterating\n   text include:\n   a.  United Nations\
    \ Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN)\n   b.  US Library of Congress\
    \ (LOC)\n   c.  US Board on Geographic Names (BGN)\n   d.  Korean Ministry of\
    \ Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST)\n   e.  International Organization for Standardization\
    \ (ISO)\n   The usage of this extension is not limited to formal transformations,\n\
    \   and may include other instances where the content is in some other\n   way\
    \ influenced by the source.  For example, this extension could be\n   used to\
    \ designate a request for a speech recognizer that is tailored\n   specifically\
    \ for second-language speakers who are first-language\n   speakers of a particular\
    \ language (e.g., a recognizer for \"English\n   spoken with a Chinese accent\"\
    ).\n"

- title: 2.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Overview\n   Identification of transformed content can be done using the\
    \ 't'\n   extension defined in this document.  This extension is formed by the\n\
    \   't' singleton followed by a sequence of subtags that would form a\n   language\
    \ tag as defined by [BCP47].  This allows the source language\n   or script to\
    \ be specified to the degree of precision required.  There\n   are restrictions\
    \ on the sequence of subtags.  They MUST form a\n   regular, valid, canonical\
    \ language tag, and MUST neither include\n   extensions nor private use sequences\
    \ introduced by the singleton 'x'.\n   Where only the script is relevant (such\
    \ as identifying a script-\n   script transliteration), then 'und' is used for\
    \ the primary language\n   subtag.\n   For example:\n   +---------------------+---------------------------------------------+\n\
    \   | Language Tag        | Description                                 |\n  \
    \ +---------------------+---------------------------------------------+\n   |\
    \ ja-t-it             | The content is Japanese, transformed from   |\n   |  \
    \                   | Italian.                                    |\n   | ja-Kana-t-it\
    \        | The content is Japanese Katakana,           |\n   |               \
    \      | transformed from Italian.                   |\n   | und-Latn-t-und-cyrl\
    \ | The content is in the Latin script,         |\n   |                     |\
    \ transformed from the Cyrillic script.       |\n   +---------------------+---------------------------------------------+\n\
    \   Note that the sequence of subtags governed by 't' cannot contain a\n   singleton\
    \ (a single-character subtag), because that would start a new\n   extension. \
    \ For example, the tag \"ja-t-i-ami\" does not indicate that\n   the source is\
    \ in \"i-ami\", because \"i-ami\" is not a regular language\n   tag in [BCP47].\
    \  That tag would express an empty 't' extension\n   followed by an 'i' extension.\n\
    \   The 't' extension is not intended for use in structured data that\n   already\
    \ provides separate source and target language identifiers.\n   For example, this\
    \ is the case in localization interchange formats\n   such as XLIFF.  In such\
    \ cases, it would be inappropriate to use\n   \"ja-t-it\" for the target language\
    \ tag because the source language tag\n   \"it\" would already be present in the\
    \ data.  Instead, one would use\n   the language tag \"ja\".\n   As noted earlier,\
    \ it is sometimes necessary to indicate additional\n   information about a transformation.\
    \  This additional information is\n   optionally supplied after the source in\
    \ a series of one or more\n   fields, where each field consists of a field separator\
    \ subtag\n   followed by one or more non-separator subtags.  Each field separator\n\
    \   subtag consists of a single letter followed by a single digit.\n   A transformation\
    \ mechanism is an optional field that indicates the\n   specification used for\
    \ the transformation, such as \"UNGEGN\" for the\n   United Nations Group of Experts\
    \ on Geographical Names\n   transliterations and transcriptions.  It uses the\
    \ 'm0' field\n   separator followed by certain subtags.\n   For example:\n   +------------------------------------+------------------------------+\n\
    \   | Language Tag                       | Description                  |\n  \
    \ +------------------------------------+------------------------------+\n   |\
    \ und-Cyrl-t-und-latn-m0-ungegn-2007 | The content is in Cyrillic,  |\n   |  \
    \                                  | transformed from Latin,      |\n   |    \
    \                                | according to a UNGEGN        |\n   |      \
    \                              | specification dated 2007.    |\n   +------------------------------------+------------------------------+\n\
    \   The field separator subtags, such as 'm0', were chosen because they\n   are\
    \ short, visually distinctive, and cannot occur in a language\n   subtag (outside\
    \ of an extension and after 'x'), thus eliminating the\n   potential for collision\
    \ or confusion with the source language tag.\n   The field subtags are defined\
    \ by Section 3 of Unicode Technical\n   Standard #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup\
    \ Language (LDML) [UTS35], the\n   main specification for the Unicode Common Locale\
    \ Data Repository\n   (CLDR) project.  That section also defines the parallel\
    \ 'u' extension\n   [RFC6067], for which the Unicode Consortium is also the maintaining\n\
    \   authority.  As required by BCP 47, subtags follow the language tag\n   ABNF\
    \ and other rules for the formation of language tags and subtags,\n   are restricted\
    \ to the ASCII letters and digits, are not case\n   sensitive, and do not exceed\
    \ eight characters in length.\n   The LDML specification is available over the\
    \ Internet and at no cost,\n   and is available via a royalty-free license at\n\
    \   http://unicode.org/copyright.html.  LDML is versioned, and each\n   version\
    \ of LDML is numbered, dated, and stable.  Extension subtags,\n   once defined\
    \ by LDML, are never retracted or substantially changed in\n   meaning.\n   The\
    \ maintaining authority for the 't' extension is the Unicode\n   Consortium:\n\

- title: 2.5.  Field Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Field Definitions\n   Assignment of 't' field subtags is determined by\
    \ the Unicode CLDR\n   Technical Committee, in accordance with the policies and\
    \ procedures\n   in http://www.unicode.org/consortium/tc-procedures.html, and\
    \ subject\n   to the Unicode Consortium Policies on\n   http://www.unicode.org/policies/policies.html.\n\
    \   Assignments that can be made by successive versions of LDML [UTS35]\n   by\
    \ the Unicode Consortium without requiring a new RFC include:\n   o  The allocation\
    \ of new field separator subtags for use after the\n      't' extension.\n   o\
    \  The allocation of subtags valid after a field separator subtag.\n   o  The\
    \ addition of subtag aliases and descriptions.\n   o  The modification of subtag\
    \ descriptions.\n   Changes to the syntax or meaning of the 't' extension would\
    \ require a\n   new RFC that obsoletes this document; such an RFC would break\n\
    \   stability, and would thus be contrary to the policies of the Unicode\n   Consortium.\n\
    \   At the time this document was published, one field separator subtag\n   was\
    \ specified in [UTS35]: the transform mechanism.  That field is\n   summarized\
    \ here:\n   a.  The transform mechanism consists of a sequence of subtags\n  \
    \     starting with the 'm0' separator followed by one or more\n       mechanism\
    \ subtags.  Each mechanism subtag has a length of 3 to 8\n       alphanumeric\
    \ characters.  The sequence as a whole provides an\n       identification of the\
    \ specification for the transform, such as\n       the mechanism subtag 'ungegn'\
    \ in \"und-Cyrl-t-und-latn-m0-ungegn\".\n       In many cases, only one mechanism\
    \ subtag is necessary, but\n       multiple subtags MAY be defined in [UTS35]\
    \ where necessary.\n   b.  Any purely numeric subtag is a representation of a\
    \ date in the\n       Gregorian calendar.  It MAY occur in any mechanism field,\
    \ but it\n       SHOULD only be used where necessary.  If it does occur:\n   \
    \    *  it MUST occur as the final subtag in the field\n       *  it MUST NOT\
    \ be the only subtag in the field\n       *  it MUST only consist of a sequence\
    \ of digits of the form YYYY,\n          YYYYMM, or YYYYMMDD\n       *  it SHOULD\
    \ be as short as possible\n       Note: The format is related to that of [RFC3339],\
    \ but is not the\n       same.  The RFC 3339 full-date won't work because it uses\
    \ hyphens.\n       The offset (\"Z\") is not used because the date is a publication\n\
    \       date (aka 'floating date').  For more information, see\n       Section\
    \ 3.3 (\"Floating Time\") of [W3C-TimeZones].\n   c.  Examples:\n       *  20110623\
    \ represents June 23, 2011.\n       *  There are three dated versions of the UNGEGN\
    \ transliteration\n          specification for Hebrew to Latin.  They can be represented\
    \ by\n          the following language tags:\n          +  und-Hebr-t-und-latn-m0-ungegn-1972\n\
    \          +  und-Hebr-t-und-latn-m0-ungegn-1977\n          +  und-Hebr-t-und-latn-m0-ungegn-2007\n\
    \       *  Suppose that the BGN transliteration specification for\n          Cyrillic\
    \ to Latin had three versions, dated June 11, 1999;\n          Dec 30, 1999; and\
    \ May 1, 2011.  In that case, the\n          corresponding first two DATE subtags\
    \ would require the months\n          to be distinctive (199906 and 199912), but\
    \ the last subtag\n          would only require the year (2011).\n   d.  Some\
    \ mechanisms may use a versioning system that is not\n       distinguished by\
    \ date, or not by date alone.  In the latter case,\n       the version will be\
    \ of a form specified by [UTS35] for that\n       mechanism.  For example, if\
    \ the mechanism xxx uses versions of\n       the form v21a, then a tag could look\
    \ like \"ja-t-it-m0-xxx-v21a\".\n       If there are multiple sub-versions distinguished\
    \ by date, then a\n       tag could look like \"ja-t-it-m0-xxx-v21a-2007\".\n\
    \   A language tag with the 't' extension MAY be used to request a\n   specific\
    \ transform of content.  In such a case, the recipient SHOULD\n   return content\
    \ that corresponds as closely as feasible to the\n   requested transform, including\
    \ the specification of the mechanism.\n   For example, if the request is ja-t-it-m0-xxx-v21a-2007,\
    \ and the\n   recipient has content corresponding to both ja-t-it-m0-xxx-v21a\
    \ and\n   ja-t-it-m0-xxx-v21b-2009, then the v21a version would be preferred.\n\
    \   As is the case for language matching as discussed in [BCP47],\n   different\
    \ implementations MAY have different measures of \"closeness\".\n"

  contents:
  - "2.9.  Machine-Readable Data\n   Beginning with CLDR version 1.7.2, machine-readable\
    \ files are\n   available listing the data defined for BCP 47 extensions for each\n\
    \   successive version of [UTS35].  The data in these files is used for\n   testing\
    \ the validity of subtags for the 't' extension and for the 'u'\n   extension\
    \ [RFC6067], for which the Unicode Consortium is also the\n   maintaining authority.\
    \  These releases are listed on\n   http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads. \
    \ Each release has an\n   associated data directory of the form\n   \"http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/<version>\"\
    , where \"<version>\" is\n   replaced by the release number.  For example, for\
    \ version 1.7.2, the\n   \"core.zip\" file is located at\n   http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/1.7.2/core.zip.\
    \  The most recent\n   version is always identified by the version \"latest\"\
    \ and can be\n   accessed by the URL in Section 2.4.\n   Inside the \"core.zip\"\
    \ file, the directory \"common/bcp47\" contains the\n   data files listing the\
    \ valid attributes, keys, and types for each\n   successive version of [UTS35].\
    \  Each data file lists the keys and\n   types relevant to that topic.\n   The\
    \ XML structure lists the keys, such as <key extension=\"t\"\n   name=\"m0\" description=\"\
    Transliteration extension mechanism\">, with\n   subelements for the types, such\
    \ as <type name=\"ungegn\"\n   description=\"United Nations Group of Experts on\

    \ get the version information in XML when working with the data\n   files, the\
    \ XML parser must be validating.  When the 'core.zip' file\n   is unzipped, the\
    \ 'dtd' directory will be at the same level as the\n   'bcp47' directory; this\
    \ is required for correct validation.  For each\n   release after CLDR 1.8, types\
    \ introduced in that release are also\n   marked in the data files by the XML\
    \ attribute \"since\", such as in the\n   following example:\n   <type name=\"\
    adp\" since=\"1.9\"/>\n   The data is also currently maintained in a source code\
    \ repository,\n   with each release tagged, for viewing directly without unzipping.\n\
    \   For example, see:\n   o  http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/tags/release-1-7-2/common/bcp47/\n\

  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has inserted the record of Section 2.4 into\

    \   Per Section 5.2 of [BCP47], there might be occasional (rare) requests\n  \
    \ by the Unicode Consortium (the \"Authority\" listed in the record) for\n   maintenance\
    \ of this record.  Changes that can be submitted to IANA\n   without the publication\
    \ of a new RFC are limited to modification of\n   the Comments, Contact_Email,\
    \ Mailing_List, and URL fields.  Any such\n   requested changes MUST use the domain\
    \ 'unicode.org' in any new\n   addresses or URIs, MUST explicitly cite this document\
    \ (so that IANA\n   can reference these requirements), and MUST originate from\
