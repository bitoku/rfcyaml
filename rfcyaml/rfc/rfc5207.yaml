  - "Abstract\n   The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) changes the way in which two\n\
    \   Internet hosts communicate.  One key advantage over other schemes is\n   that\
    \ HIP does not require modifications to the traditional network-\n   layer functionality\
    \ of the Internet, i.e., its routers.  In the\n   current Internet, however, many\
    \ devices other than routers modify the\n   traditional network-layer behavior\
    \ of the Internet.  These\n   \"middleboxes\" are intermediary devices that perform\
    \ functions other\n   than the standard functions of an IP router on the datagram\
    \ path\n   between source and destination hosts.  Whereas some types of\n   middleboxes\
    \ may not interfere with HIP at all, others can affect some\n   aspects of HIP\
    \ communication, and others can render HIP communication\n   impossible.  This\
    \ document discusses the problems associated with HIP\n   communication across\
    \ network paths that include specific types of\n   middleboxes, namely, network\
    \ address translators and firewalls.  It\n   identifies and discusses issues in\
    \ the current HIP specifications\n   that affect communication across these types\
    \ of middleboxes.  This\n   document is a product of the IRTF HIP Research Group.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The current specification of the Host Identity Protocol\
    \ (HIP)\n   [RFC4423] assumes simple Internet paths, where routers forward\n \
    \  globally routable IP packets based on their destination address\n   alone.\n\
    \   In the current Internet, such pure paths are becoming increasingly\n   rare.\
    \  For a number of reasons, several types of devices modify or\n   extend the\
    \ pure forwarding functionality the Internet's network layer\n   used to deliver.\
    \  [RFC3234] coins the term middleboxes for such\n   devices: \"A middlebox is\
    \ (...) any intermediary device performing\n   functions other than the normal,\
    \ standard functions of an IP router\n   on the datagram path between a source\
    \ host and destination host\".\n   Middleboxes affect communication in a number\
    \ of ways.  For example,\n   they may inspect the flows of some transport protocols,\
    \ such as TCP,\n   and selectively drop, insert, or modify packets.  If such devices\n\
    \   encounter a higher-layer protocol they do not support, or even a\n   variant\
    \ of a supported protocol that they do not know how to handle,\n   communication\
    \ across the middlebox may become impossible for these\n   kinds of traffic.\n\
    \   There are many different variants of middleboxes.  The most common\n   ones\
    \ are network address translators and firewalls.  [RFC3234]\n   identifies many\
    \ other types of middleboxes.  One broad way of\n   classifying them is by behavior.\
    \  The first group operates on\n   packets, does not modify application-layer\
    \ payloads, and does not\n   insert additional packets.  This group includes NAT,\
    \ NAT-PT, SOCKS\n   gateways, IP tunnel endpoints, packet classifiers, markers,\n\
    \   schedulers, transport relays, IP firewalls, application firewalls,\n   involuntary\
    \ packet redirectors, and anonymizers.\n   Other middleboxes exist (such as TCP\
    \ performance-enhancing proxies,\n   application-level gateways, gatekeepers,\
    \ session control boxes,\n   transcoders, proxies, caches, modified DNS servers,\
    \ content and\n   applications distribution boxes, and load balancers) that divert\
    \ or\n   modify URLs, application-level interceptors, and application-level\n\
    \   multicast systems.  However, NATs and firewalls are the most frequent\n  \
    \ middleboxes that HIP traffic can encounter in the Internet.\n   Consequently,\
    \ this memo focuses on how NAT and firewall middleboxes\n   can interfere with\
    \ HIP traffic.\n   Middleboxes can cause two different kinds of communication\
    \ problems\n   for HIP.  They can interfere with the transmission of HIP control\n\
    \   traffic or with the transmission of the HIP data traffic carried\n   within\
    \ the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303].\n   This document serves\
    \ mainly as a problem description that solution\n   proposals can reference. \
    \ But it also discusses known approaches to\n   solving the problem and gives\
    \ recommendations for certain approaches\n   depending on the specific scenario.\
    \  It does not promote the use of\n   any of the discussed types of middleboxes.\n\
    \   This memo was discussed and modified in the Host Identity Protocol\n   Research\
    \ Group, was reviewed by the Internet Research Steering Group\n   (IRSG), and\
    \ represents a consensus view of the research group at the\n   time of its submission\
    \ for publication.\n"
- title: 2.  HIP across NATs
  contents:
  - "2.  HIP across NATs\n   This section focuses on the traversal of HIP across network\
    \ address\n   translator (NAT) middleboxes.  This document uses the term NAT for\
    \ a\n   basic translation of IP addresses, whereas it uses the term NAPT for\n\
    \   NATs that additionally perform port translation [RFC2663], if a\n   differentiation\
    \ between the two is important.\n   HIP operates in two phases.  It first performs\
    \ a HIP \"base exchange\"\n   handshake before starting to exchange application\
    \ data in the second\n   phase.  This section describes the problems that occur\
    \ in each of the\n   two phases when NATs are present along the path from the\
    \ HIP\n   initiator to the responder.\n"
- title: '2.1.  Phase 1: HIP Base Exchange'
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Phase 1: HIP Base Exchange\n   The HIP base exchange uses different transport\
    \ mechanisms for IPv6\n   and IPv4.  With IPv6, it uses a HIP-specific IPv6 extension\
    \ header,\n   whereas it uses the IP payload with IPv4 [RFC5201].\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  IPv4 HIP Base Exchange
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  IPv4 HIP Base Exchange\n   The HIP protocol specification [RFC5201] suggests\
    \ encapsulating the\n   IPv4 HIP base exchange in a new IP payload type.  The\
    \ chances of NAT\n   traversal for this traffic are different, depending on the\
    \ type of\n   NAT in the path.  The IPv4 HIP base exchange traverses basic NATs\n\
    \   (that translate IP addresses only) without problems, if the NAT only\n   interprets\
    \ and modifies the IP header, i.e., it does not inspect the\n   IP payload.\n\
    \   However, basic NATs are rare.  NAPT devices that inspect and\n   translate\
    \ transport-layer port numbers are much more common.  Because\n   the IP payload\
    \ used for the IPv4 base exchange does not contain port\n   numbers or other demultiplexing\
    \ fields, NAPTs cannot relay it.\n   A second issue is the well-known \"data receiver\
    \ behind a NAT\"\n   problem.  HIP nodes behind a NAT are not reachable unless\
    \ they\n   initiate the communication themselves, because the necessary\n   translation\
    \ state is otherwise not present at the NAT.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  IPv6 HIP Base Exchange
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  IPv6 HIP Base Exchange\n   The IPv6 HIP base exchange uses empty IPv6\
    \ packets (without a\n   payload).  New HIP extension headers carry the base exchange\n\
    \   information.  This approach can cause problems if NAT middleboxes\n   translate\
    \ or multiplex IP addresses.\n   At this time, IPv6 NATs are rare.  However, when\
    \ they exist, IPv6\n   NATs operate similarly to IPv4 NATs.  Consequently, they\
    \ will likely\n   block IP payloads other than the \"well-known\" transport protocols.\n\
    \   This includes the IPv6 HIP base exchange, which does not contain any\n   IP\
    \ payload.\n"
- title: '2.2.  Phase 2: ESP Data Exchange'
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Phase 2: ESP Data Exchange\n   HIP uses ESP to secure the data transmission\
    \ between two HIP nodes\n   after the base exchange completes.  Thus, HIP faces\
    \ the same\n   challenges as IPsec with regard to NAT traversal.  [RFC3715]\n\
    \   discusses these issues for IPsec and describes three distinct problem\n  \
    \ categories: NAT-intrinsic issues, NAT implementation issues, and\n   helper\
    \ incompatibilities.\n   This section focuses on the first category, i.e., NAT-intrinsic\n\
    \   issues.  The two other problem categories are out of this document's\n   scope.\
    \  They are addressed in the BEHAVE working group or in\n   [RFC3489].\n   With\
    \ ESP-encrypted data traffic, all upper-layer headers are\n   invisible to a NAT.\
    \  Thus, changes of the IP header during NAT\n   traversal can invalidate upper-layer\
    \ checksums contained within the\n   ESP-protected payload.  HIP hosts already\
    \ avoid this problem by\n   substituting Host Identity Tags (HITs) for IP addresses\
    \ during\n   checksum calculations [RFC5201].\n   Although the traversal of ESP-encrypted\
    \ packets across NATs is\n   possible, [RFC3715] notes that the Security Parameter\
    \ Index (SPI)\n   values of such traffic have only one-way significance.  NATs\
    \ can use\n   SPI values to demultiplex different IPsec flows, similar to how\
    \ they\n   use port number pairs to demultiplex unencrypted transport flows.\n\
    \   Furthermore, NATs may modify the SPIs, similar to how they modify\n   port\
    \ numbers, when multiple IPsec nodes behind them happen to choose\n   identical\
    \ SPIs.  However, NATs can only observe the SPIs of outgoing\n   IPsec flows and\
    \ cannot determine the SPIs of the corresponding return\n   traffic.\n"

  - "3.  HIP Across Firewalls\n   This section focuses on the traversal of HIP across\
    \ IP firewalls and\n   packet filters.  These types of middleboxes inspect individual\n\
    \   packets and decide whether to forward, discard, or process them in\n   some\
    \ special way, based on a set of filter rules and associated\n   actions.\n  \
    \ Firewalls are not inherently problematic for HIP, as long as their\n   policy\
    \ rules permit HIP base exchange and IPsec traffic to traverse.\n   The next sections\

    \   characteristics (\"scrubbed\" traffic).  This common configuration\n   blocks\

    \ an IP option.\n   With IPv6, the expectation is that firewalls will block IPv6\n\
    \   extension headers in general or will at least block unknown extension\n  \
    \ headers.  Furthermore, payloads other than specific, well-known\n   transport\
    \ protocols are likely to be blocked as well.  Like IPv4,\n   this behavior blocks\
    \ the HIP base exchange.\n   A problem similar to the \"data receiver behind a\
    \ NAT\" issue (see\n   Section 2.1.1) applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 firewalls.\
    \  Typically,\n   firewalls block all traffic into the protected network that\
    \ is not\n   identifiable return traffic of a prior outbound communication.  This\n\
    \   means that HIP peers are not reachable outside the protected network,\n  \
    \ because firewalls block base exchange attempts from outside peers.\n"

- title: 4.  HIP Extensions
  contents:
  - "4.  HIP Extensions\n   This section identifies possible changes to HIP that attempt\
    \ to\n   improve NAT and firewall traversal, specifically, the reachability of\n\
    \   HIP peers behind those middleboxes and traversal of the HIP base\n   exchange.\
    \  Sections 2 and 3 describe several problems related to\n   encapsulation schemes\
    \ for the HIP base exchange in IPv4 and IPv6.\n   UDP may improve HIP operation\
    \ in the presence of NATs and firewalls.\n   It may also aid traversal of other\
    \ middleboxes.  For example, load\n   balancers that use IP- and transport-layer\
    \ information can correctly\n   operate with UDP-encapsulated HIP traffic.\n \
    \  HIP nodes located behind a NAT must notify their communication peers\n   about\
    \ the contact information.  The contact information is the NAT's\n   public IP\
    \ address and a specific UDP port number.  This measure\n   enables the peers\
    \ to send return traffic to HIP nodes behind the NAT.\n   This would require a\
    \ new HIP mechanism.\n   To be reachable behind a NAT, a rendezvous point is required\
    \ that\n   lets HIP nodes behind a NAT register an IP address and port number\n\
    \   that can be used to contact them.  Depending on the type of NAT, use\n   of\
    \ this rendezvous point may be required only during the base\n   exchange or throughout\
    \ the duration of a communication instance.  A\n   rendezvous point is also useful\
    \ for HIP nodes behind firewalls,\n   because they suffer from an analogous problem,\
    \ as described in\n   Section 3.\n   The proposed mobility management packet exchange\
    \ [RFC5206] [NIKANDER]\n   can support this method of NAT traversal.  The original\
    \ intention of\n   this extension is to support host mobility and multihoming.\
    \  This\n   mechanism is similar to the Alternate Network Address Types (ANAT)\n\
    \   described in [RFC4091].  However, HIP peers use mobility management\n   messages\
    \ to notify peers about rendezvous points, similar to\n   [RFC4091].  HIP peers\
    \ must determine their contact address before\n   they can announce it to their\
    \ peers.\n"
- title: 5.  NAT Extensions
  contents:
  - "5.  NAT Extensions\n   IPsec SPIs have only one-way significance, as described\
    \ in\n   Section 2.2.  Consequently, NATs and firewalls can observe the SPI\n\
    \   values of outgoing packets, but they cannot learn the SPI values of\n   the\
    \ corresponding inbound return traffic in the same way.  Two\n   methods exist:\n\
    \   First, NATs can observe the HIP base exchange and learn the SPI\n   values\
    \ that HIP peers agree to use.  Afterwards, NATs can map\n   outgoing and incoming\
    \ IPsec flows accordingly.  This approach is\n   called architectured NAT, or\
    \ SPINAT [YLITALO], and can be used by\n   firewalls as well.  It requires HIP-specific\
    \ NAT modifications.\n   Second, HIP peers can use a generic NAT or firewall signaling\n\
    \   protocol to explicitly signal appropriate SPI values to their NATs\n   and\
    \ firewalls.  This approach does not require HIP-specific changes\n   at the middlebox,\
    \ but does require integration of HIP with the\n   signaling protocol at the end\
    \ systems.\n   Possible solutions for signaling SPI values are the mechanisms\n\
    \   proposed in the IETF NSIS WG (NATFW NSLP) and MIDCOM MIB module\n   [RFC5190].\
    \  Using MIDCOM in the context of HIP requires additional\n   knowledge about\
    \ network topology.  For example, in multihomed\n   environments with different\
    \ border NATs or firewalls, a host must\n   know which of the multiple NATs/firewalls\
    \ to signal.  Therefore, this\n   solution can be problematic.\n   By using the\
    \ NSIS NAT/FW traversal (NATFW NSLP) mechanism HIP nodes\n   can signal the used\
    \ SPI values for both directions.  NATFW NSLP\n   ensures that signaling messages\
    \ will reach all NATs and firewalls\n   along the data path (path-coupled signaling).\
    \  Although NSIS is\n   generally supported at both peers, the NATFW NSLP offers\
    \ a \"proxy\n   mode\" for scenarios where only one end supports NSIS.  This has\n\
    \   deployment advantages.\n"
- title: 6.  Legacy NAT and Firewall Traversal
  contents:
  - "6.  Legacy NAT and Firewall Traversal\n   The solutions outlined in Section 5\
    \ require that NATs and firewalls\n   are updated to support new functions, such\
    \ as HIP itself or NSIS\n   NATFW signaling.  NATs and firewalls are already widely\
    \ deployed.  It\n   will be impossible to upgrade or replace all such middleboxes\
    \ with\n   HIP support.  This section explores how HIP operates in the presence\n\
    \   of legacy NATs and firewalls that are not HIP-aware.  Because the\n   vast\
    \ majority of deployed NATs currently support IPv4 only, this\n   section focuses\
    \ on them.\n   For HIP over IPv4, UDP encapsulation of HIP traffic already solves\n\
    \   some NAT traversal issues.  Usually, UDP packets can traverse NATs\n   and\
    \ firewalls when communication was initiated from the inside.\n   However, traffic\
    \ initiated outside a NAT is typically dropped,\n   because it cannot be demultiplexed\
    \ to the final destination (for\n   NATs) or is prohibited by policy (for firewalls).\n\
    \   Even when UDP encapsulation enables the HIP base exchange to succeed,\n  \
    \ ESP still causes problems [RFC3715].  Some NAT implementations offer\n   \"\
    VPN pass-through\", where the NAT learns about IPsec flows and tries\n   to correlate\
    \ outgoing and incoming SPI values.  This often works\n   reliably only for a\
    \ small number of nodes behind a single NAT, due to\n   the possibility of SPI\
    \ collisions.\n   A better solution may be to use UDP encapsulation for ESP [RFC3948],\n\
    \   enabled through a new parameter in the base exchange.  It is for\n   further\
    \ study whether to mandate UDP encapsulation for all HIP\n   traffic to reduce\
    \ the complexity of the protocol.\n   HIP may also consider other NAT/firewall\
    \ traversal mechanisms, such\n   as the widely deployed Universal Plug and Play\
    \ (UPNP) [UPNP].  UPNP\n   can be used to configure middleboxes on the same link\
    \ as a HIP node.\n"
