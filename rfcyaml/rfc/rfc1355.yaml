  - "Abstract\n   This document provides a set of guidelines for the administration\
    \ and\n   operation of public Network Information Center (NIC) databases.  The\n\
    \   purpose is to formalize procedures for the responsible handling of\n   the\
    \ personal and organizational information maintained by NICs in\n   publically\
    \ accessible databases, and to improve the accuracy and\n   accessibility of such\
    \ data where appropriate.\n"

- title: 1. Purpose
  contents:
  - "1. Purpose\n   The purpose of this document is to consider the privacy and accuracy\n\
    \   issues that result from many NIC databases being publicly accessible.\n  \
    \ This document considers only generic concerns about such systems; it\n   intentionally\
    \ does not make recommendations for specific databases on\n   the Internet.  Clearly,\
    \ it is the responsibility of each NIC to\n   determine what procedures should\
    \ apply for each of its databases.\n   The document discusses the obligations\
    \ a NIC that maintains such a\n   database has towards those about whom data appears\
    \ in the database.\n   These obligations apply to database entries that contain\
    \ information\n   that is publically accessible to Internet users.\n"
- title: 2. Background and Organization
  contents:
  - "2. Background and Organization\n   In fulfilling the functions of a Network Information\
    \ Center, each NIC\n   needs to collect and distribute a variety of information\
    \ about the\n   network it serves.  Much of the information handled by a NIC is\n\
    \   \"directory\" information that provides pointers to people,\n   organizations,\
    \ and resources throughout a network.  The use of\n   publically accessible databases\
    \ to disseminate such data is seen as\n   beneficial to the Internet because it\
    \ allows efficient information\n   retrieval by users, Network Operation Centers\
    \ (NOCs), and other NICs.\n   This document is organized into two parts.  The\
    \ first part contains\n   recommendations for preventing unauthorized disclosure\
    \ of information\n   in NIC databases.  The second part recommends formal accuracy\n\
    \   guidelines for NIC databases.\n"
- title: 3. NIC Database Privacy
  contents:
  - "3. NIC Database Privacy\n   The existence of publically accessible databases\
    \ brings up a number\n   of significant questions regarding controls over the\
    \ gathering and\n   distribution of the data.  It is important that these concerns\
    \ are\n   addressed prior to the wide-scale deployment of a public NIC database\n\
    \   or a NIC risks having to retrofit an established system to formal\n   guidelines\
    \ regarding such controls when they are finally available.\n   For each publically\
    \ accessible database that a NIC manages, the NIC\n   needs to provide a clear\
    \ statement of the purpose of the database,\n   the types of information it contains,\
    \ and the privacy policy that\n   applies to the information stored within it.\
    \  In general, this policy\n   should inform people or organizations listed in\
    \ the database of the\n   content and purpose of their database entries.  Specifically,\
    \ the\n   privacy policy should:\n      1) Describe why the NIC needs the information\
    \ and how it will use\n         the information.\n      2) List of all the information\
    \ being stored in an entry.\n      3) Detail which information will be made available\
    \ outside of the\n         NIC, to whom it will be made available, and for what\
    \ purpose.\n      4) Provide for notification of any person or organization added\n\
    \         to the database at the request of a third party.\n      5) Explain how\
    \ to have the information changed or updated.\n      6) Explain how to get information\
    \ removed from the database,\n         including any references to one's information\
    \ in another's\n         database entry.\n      7) Explain the consequences of\
    \ removing information from the\n         database and of failing to provide all\
    \ or part of the\n         information a NIC requests.\n   The privacy policy\
    \ enables people to make informed decisions\n   regarding which information to\
    \ supply for a given NIC database.  Any\n   information supplied should treated\
    \ in a manner consistent with the\n   current privacy policy.  If a NIC makes\
    \ a database available in its\n   entirety to another organization, the NIC should\
    \ also provide that\n   organization with a copy of the current privacy policy\
    \ for the\n   database.\n"
- title: 4. NIC Database Accuracy
  contents:
  - "4. NIC Database Accuracy\n   The value of any NIC database is dependent on the\
    \ accuracy and\n   timeliness of its contents.  Any database not being maintained\
    \ well\n   can create major difficulties for those using it and for those people\n\
    \   and organizations listed.\n   For each publically accessible database that\
    \ a NIC operates, the NIC\n   should have a clear statement that describes the\
    \ process that the NIC\n   uses to maintain accuracy in the database.  This statement\
    \ could be\n   combined with the privacy statement described above for sake of\n\
    \   administrative convenience.\n   The accuracy statement informs potential participants\
    \ in the database\n   of the precautions taken by the NIC to ensure accurate information.\n\
    \   Any information supplied should be treated in a manner consistent\n   with\
    \ the current accuracy policy.  If a NIC makes a database\n   available in its\
    \ entirety to another organization, the NIC should\n   also provide that organization\
    \ with a copy of the current accuracy\n   policy for the database.\n   The accuracy\
    \ statement should:\n      1) Allow an individual or organization access to its\
    \ own\n         database entry, including private fields, for the purpose\n  \
    \       of correcting errors.\n      2) Allow an individual or organization to\
    \ correct any errors\n         that occur in its database entry.\n      3) Inform\
    \ an individual or organization when information about\n         them appears\
    \ in an entry belonging to another party, so\n         that the individual or\
    \ organization can review that\n         information and have the opportunity\
    \ to submit corrections.\n      4) Change information in an entry only at the\
    \ request of or\n         with the approval of the individual or organization\n\
    \         about which the entry applies.\n      5) Encourage an individual or\
    \ organization to report any errors\n         that occur in the database entries\
    \ of others.\n      6) Provide for a \"date of last review\" for each entry in\
    \ the\n         database; this would reflect the date that the entry was\n   \
    \      last checked by the owner for accuracy.\n      7) Describe any and all\
    \ practices used by the NIC to confirm\n         data prior to inclusion in the\
    \ database.\n      8) State the data backup procedures in use for this database.\n"
