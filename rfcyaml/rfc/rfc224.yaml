  - "                  Comments on Mailbox Protocol\n     It should be noted that\
    \ the Terminal IMP will be unable to\ndirectly implement the currently-proposed\
    \ mailbox protocol for\nthe following reasons:\n     a)  The Terminal IMP is completely\
    \ incapable of storing\n         incoming messages for later printing or display.\n\
    \     b)  The Terminal IMP is not expected to be able to perform\n         as\
    \ the \"server\" portion of any connection.\n     c)  The Terminal IMP cannot\
    \ provide programs for the\n         processing of a variety of types of input\
    \ streams.\n         It currently supports the TELNET protocol, and is\n     \
    \    expected to support at least one mode of Data\n         Transfer Protocol\
    \ in the future.  It is _not_ likely\n         to support the File Transfer Protocol.\
    \  Furthermore,\n         when using the Data Transfer Protocol it will not\n\
    \         perform any transformations on the data stream\n         (e.g., interpretation\
    \ of line printer form-control\n         \"characters,\" translation from one\
    \ character set to\n         another, etc.).  It will be up to the \"other end\"\
    \n         of the connection to set up and decode messages based\n         on\
    \ the terminal type.\n     Although these limitations preclude Terminal IMPs from\n\
    participating in the currently-proposed mailbox protocol, this\nshould not be\
    \ considered an objection to implementation of the\nprotocol, provided that Terminal\
    \ IMP installations will be\nguaranteed the right to \"rent\" mailboxes at some\
    \ larger Host\nsite [the NIC is probably a good candidate].  With this capability,\n\
    a message destined for a Terminal IMP user would be shipped to the\nsite of the\
    \ \"rented\" mailbox according to protocol and stored\nthere.  A terminal IMP\
    \ user could then periodically log in to that\nsite (under TELNET protocol) and\
    \ examine the contents of the\nmailbox; since the \"examination\" would be carried\
    \ out over a\nTELNET connection the Host containing the mailbox would _automatically_\n\
    perform the necessary transformation of the data before transmitting\nit to the\
    \ Terminal IMP.\n     A technically unattractive alternative to this scheme would\n\
    be to _require_ each Terminal IMP site to have a printer dedicated\nto the mailbox\
    \ function.  If the mail were then transferred in\nTELNET format, we could probably\
    \ provide a socket connected to\nthe dedicated printer for receipt of mail.  Obviously,\
    \ if this\nscheme were chosen, a Terminal IMP could accept mail from only\none\
    \ sender at a time, and the transmission rate would be limited\nto the speed of\
    \ the printer.  Furthermore, a single central\nmailbox printer is likely to provide\
    \ poor service to Terminal\nIMPs with widely scattered terminals (e.g., dial-in\
    \ terminals\ndistributed over an area with a 10-mile radius).\n     We feel that,\
    \ in addition to other arguments, it would be\nmore cost-effective to provide\
    \ storage for rented mailboxes at\none site than to provide a _special_ mailbox\
    \ printer at each\nTerminal IMP site.\nAMcK:jm\n    [ This RFC was put into machine\
