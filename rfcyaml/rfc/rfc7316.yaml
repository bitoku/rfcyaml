  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies the SIP P-Private-Network-Indication P-header\n\
    \   used by the 3GPP.  The P-Private-Network-Indication indicates that\n   the\
    \ message is part of the message traffic of a private network and\n   identifies\
    \ that private network.  A private network indication allows\n   nodes to treat\
    \ private network traffic according to a different set\n   of rules than the set\
    \ applicable to public network traffic.\n"

- title: 1.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview\n   ETSI TISPAN (Telecommunications and Internet converged Services\
    \ and\n   Protocols for Advanced Networking) defined Next Generation Networks\n\
    \   (NGNs), which use the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which, in\n   turn,\
    \ uses SIP [RFC3261] as its main signaling protocol.  For more\n   information\
    \ on the IMS, a detailed description can be found in 3GPP\n   TS 23.228 [3GPP.23.228]\
    \ and 3GPP TS 24.229 [3GPP.24.229]. 3GPP and\n   ETSI TISPAN have identified a\
    \ set of requirements that can be met by\n   defining a new optional SIP header,\
    \ according to the procedures in\n   RFC 5727 [RFC5727].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Applicability\n   The P-Private-Network-Indication header field is intended\
    \ to be used\n   in controlled closed networks like 3GPP IMS and ETSI TISPAN NGNs.\n\
    \   The P-Private-Network-Indication header is not intended for the\n   general\
    \ Internet environment and is probably not suitable for such an\n   environment.\n\
    \   For example, there are no mechanisms defined to prevent spoofing of\n   this\
    \ header.  So, if a network were to accept calls carrying this\n   header from\
    \ the general Internet, an attacker would be able to inject\n   information into\
    \ private networks.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Background\n   The P-Private-Network-Indication header field has been referred\
    \ to in\n   3GPP IMS specifications and has already been used in some networks\
    \ as\n   an indicator for a specific capability.  The header field has already\n\
    \   been implemented in some vendors' equipment in some countries.  RFC\n   5727\
    \ [RFC5727] prohibits the new proposal of P-header \"unless\n   existing deployments\
    \ or standards use the prefix already\".  The\n   P-Private-Network-Indication\
    \ header field is already used by existing\n   deployments and 3GPP standards;\
    \ therefore, this is exactly the case\n   where the P-header is allowed as an\
    \ exception.\n"
- title: 1.4.  Business Communication
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Business Communication\n   ETSI TISPAN has identified a framework, which\
    \ was adopted by 3GPP as\n   [3GPP.22.519], for the support of business communication\
    \ capabilities\n   by the NGN.  In addition to the direct attachment of Next Generation\n\
    \   Corporate Network (NGCN) equipment, this includes the capability to\n   \"\
    host\" functionality relating to an enterprise within the NGN itself.\n   These\
    \ hosting arrangements are:\n   a)  virtual leased line, where NGCN sites are\
    \ interconnected through\n       the NGN;\n   b)  business trunking application,\
    \ where the NGN hosts transit\n       capabilities between NGCN's; break-in capabilities,\
    \ where the NGN\n       converts public network traffic to private network traffic\
    \ for\n       delivery at a served NGCN; and break-out capabilities, where the\n\
    \       NGN converts private network traffic from a served NGCN to public\n  \
    \     network traffic; and\n   c)  hosted enterprise services, where an NGN hosts\
    \ originating and/or\n       terminating business communication capabilities for\
    \ business\n       communication users that are directly attached to an NGN.\n\
    \   ETSI TISPAN has requirements that can be met by the introduction of\n   an\
    \ explicit indication for private network traffic.\n   The traffic generated or\
    \ received by a public NGN on behalf of a\n   private network can be either:\n\
    \   1)  public network traffic: traffic sent to or received from an NGN\n    \
    \   for processing according to the rules for ordinary subscribers of\n      \
    \ a public telecommunication network.  This type of traffic is\n       known as\
    \ public network traffic.\n   2)  private network traffic: traffic sent to the\
    \ NGN for processing\n       according to an agreed set of rules specific to an\
    \ enterprise.\n       This type of traffic is known as private network traffic.\n\
    \       Private network traffic is normally exchanged within a single\n      \
    \ enterprise, but private network traffic can also be exchanged\n       between\
    \ two or more different enterprises, based on some prior\n       arrangements,\
    \ if not precluded for regulatory reasons.\n"
- title: 1.5.  Indication Types
  contents:
  - "1.5.  Indication Types\n   A private network indication as proposed by this document\
    \ indicates\n   to the receiving network element (supporting this specification)\
    \ that\n   this request is related to private network traffic as opposed to\n\
    \   public network traffic.  This indication does not identify an end\n   user\
    \ on a private network and is not for delivery to an end user on\n   the private\
    \ network.  It is an indication that special service\n   arrangements apply (if\
    \ such service is configured based on private\n   network traffic) for an enterprise;\
    \ therefore, it is an indication of\n   service on behalf of an enterprise, not\
    \ an indication of service to a\n   private network's end user.\n   In order to\
    \ allow NGN IMS nodes to perform different processing, ETSI\n   TISPAN formulated\
    \ the following requirements for NGN.  The NGN shall:\n   a)  distinguish public\
    \ network traffic from private network traffic;\n       and\n   b)  distinguish\
    \ private network traffic belonging to one enterprise\n       from that belonging\
    \ to another enterprise.\n   To summarize, a few example reasons for a public\
    \ NGN to make the\n   distinction between the two types of traffic include:\n\
    \   1)  Different regulations apply to two types of traffic, for example,\n  \
    \     emergency calls may be handled differently depending on the type\n     \
    \  of traffic.\n   2)  Different charging regimes may apply.\n   3)  Call recording\
    \ for business reasons (e.g., quality control,\n       training, non-repudiation)\
    \ might apply only to a specific type of\n       traffic.\n   4)  Different levels\
    \ of signaling and/or media transparency may apply\n       to the different types\
    \ of traffic.\n   There are several reasons why there is a need for an explicit\n\
    \   indication in the signaling:\n   a)  Caller and callee addresses cannot always\
    \ be used to determine\n       whether a certain call is to be treated as private\
    \ or public\n       network traffic.\n   b)  Nodes spanning multiple networks\
    \ often need to have different\n       behavior depending upon the type of traffic.\
    \  When this is done\n       using implicit schemes, enterprise-specific logic\
    \ must be\n       distributed across multiple nodes in multiple operators'\n \
    \      networks.  That is clearly not a manageable architecture and\n       solution.\n\
    \   c)  There may be cases where treating the call as a public network\n     \
    \  call although both participants are from the same enterprise is\n       advantageous\
    \ to the enterprise.\n   Based on the background provided, this document formulates\n\
    \   requirements for SIP to support an explicit private network\n   indication\
    \ and defines a P-header, P-Private-Network-Indication, to\n   support those requirements.\n"

    \ in P-Asserted-Identity [RFC3324] and require the\n   specification of a Spec(T)\
    \ as covered in Section 2.4 of [RFC3324].\n   The same information is required\
    \ to specify a Spec(T) for purposes of\n   P-Private-Network-Indication as for\
    \ P-Asserted-Identity [RFC3324].\n   However, if a network is using P-Private-Network-Indication\
    \ as well\n   as other header fields subject to Spec(T) (such as P-Asserted-\n\
    \   Identity), the Spec(T) for each header field will probably be\n   different\
    \ from the others.\n"
- title: 4.  Application of Terminology

  - "4.  Application of Terminology\n   Figure 1 shows the interconnection of sites\
    \ belonging to two private\n   networks using the public network.  Traffic in\
    \ the public network\n   relating to the interconnection of the two sites of enterprise\
    \ 1 are\n   tagged as private network traffic relating to enterprise 1.  In\n\
    \   certain cases, an enterprise can also choose to send traffic from one\n  \
    \ enterprise site to another enterprise site as public network traffic\n   when\
    \ this is beneficial to the enterprise.  Traffic in the public\n   network relating\
    \ to the interconnection of the two sites of\n   enterprise 2 are tagged as private\
    \ network traffic relating to\n   enterprise 2.  Enterprise 1 also generates traffic\
    \ to public phones,\n   and this is public network traffic (untagged in the public\
    \ network).\n   There may be circumstances where traffic in the public network\n\
    \   between two different private networks is tagged as private network\n   traffic\
    \ using a pre-arranged domain name agreed by the two involved\n   enterprises.\
    \  This is illustrated by the interconnection of the site\n   from enterprise\
    \ 3 and the site from enterprise 4.\n                     +------------------------------+\n\

    \ phones using break-in or break-out\n   functionality.  Traffic in the public\
    \ network relating to the\n   interconnection of the site of enterprise 1 and\
    \ the hosted enterprise\n   service belonging to enterprise 1 is tagged as private\
    \ network\n   traffic relating to enterprise 1.  The hosted enterprise service\n\
    \   application also routes traffic to public phones, and this is public\n   network\
    \ traffic (untagged in the public network).  Traffic from the\n   enterprise phones\
    \ would not normally be tagged, but it can be tagged\n   as private network traffic.\

  - "5.  Overview of Solution\n   The mechanism proposed in this document relies on\
    \ a new header field\n   called 'P-Private-Network-Indication' that contains a\
    \ private network\n   identifier expressed as a domain name, for example:\n  \
    \ P-Private-Network-Indication: example.com\n   A proxy server that handles a\
    \ message MAY insert such a P-Private-\n   Network-Indication header field into\
    \ the message based on\n   authentication of the source of a message, configuration,\
    \ or local\n   policy.  A proxy server MAY forward the message to other proxies\
    \ in\n   the same administrative domain or proxies in a trusted domain to be\n\
    \   handled as private network traffic.  A proxy that forwards a message\n   to\
    \ a proxy server or user agent (UA) that it does not trust MUST\n   remove the\
    \ P-Private-Network-Indication header field before\n   forwarding the message.\n\
    \   The private network identifier expressed as a domain name allows it\n   to\
    \ be a globally unique identifier, associated with the originating\n   and/or\
    \ terminating enterprise(s).  Domain name is used, as it allows\n   reuse of a\
    \ company-owned Internet domain name without requiring an\n   additional private\
    \ network identifier registry.  When the enterprise\n   needs more than one identifier,\
    \ it can freely add subdomains under\n   its own control.\n   The formal syntax\
    \ for the P-Private-Network-Indication header is\n   presented in Section 7.\n"

  - "7.  P-Private-Network-Indication Header Field Definition\n   This document defines\
    \ the SIP P-Private-Network-Indication header\n   field.  This header field can\
    \ be added by a proxy to initial requests\n   for a dialog or standalone requests.\
    \  The presence of the P-Private-\n   Network-Indication header field signifies\
    \ to proxies that understand\n   the header field that the request is to be treated\
    \ as private network\n   traffic.  The P-Private-Network-Indication header field\
    \ contains a\n   domain name value that allows the private network traffic to\
    \ be\n   associated with an enterprise to which it belongs and allows proxies\n\
    \   that understand this header field to process the request according to\n  \
    \ the local policy configured for a specific enterprise(s).\n   The Augmented\
    \ Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] syntax of the\n   P-Private-Network-Indication\
    \ header field is described below:\n   P-Private-Network-Indication = \"P-Private-Network-Indication\"\
    \ HCOLON\n                                  PNI-value *(SEMI PNI-param)\n   PNI-param\

    \  EQUAL, HCOLON, SEMI, hostname, and generic-param are defined in RFC\n   3261\
    \ [RFC3261].\n   The following is an example of a P-Private-Network-Indication\
    \ header\n   field:\n   P-Private-Network-Indication: example.com\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The private network indication defined in this\
    \ document MUST only be\n   used in the traffic transported between network elements\
    \ that are\n   mutually trusted.  Traffic protection between network elements\
    \ can be\n   achieved by using security protocols such as IP Encapsulating\n \
    \  Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] or SIP / Transport Layer Security\n   (SIP/TLS)\
    \ or sometimes by physical protection of the network.  In any\n   case, the environment\
    \ where the private network indication will be\n   used needs to ensure the integrity\
    \ and the confidentiality of the\n   contents of this header field.\n   A private\
    \ network indication received from an untrusted node MUST NOT\n   be used, and\
    \ the information MUST be removed from a request or\n   response before it is\
    \ forwarded to entities in the trust domain.\n   Additionally, local policies\
    \ may be in place that ensure that all\n   requests entering the trust domain\
    \ for private network indication\n   from untrusted nodes with a private network\
    \ indication will be\n   discarded.\n   There is a security risk if a private\
    \ network indication is allowed\n   to propagate out of the trust domain where\
    \ it was generated.  The\n   indication may reveal information about the identity\
    \ of the caller,\n   i.e., the organization that he belongs to.  That is sensitive\n\
    \   information.  It also reveals to the outside world that there is a\n   set\
    \ of rules that this call is subject to that is different then the\n   rules that\
    \ apply to public traffic.  That is sensitive information\n   too.  To prevent\
    \ such a breach from happening, proxies MUST NOT\n   insert the information when\
    \ forwarding requests to a next hop located\n   outside the trust domain.  When\
    \ forwarding the request to a trusted\n   node, proxies MUST NOT insert the header\
    \ field unless they have\n   sufficient knowledge that the route set includes\
    \ another proxy in the\n   trust domain that understands this header field.  However,\
    \ how to\n   learn such knowledge is out of the scope of this document.  Proxies\n\
    \   MUST remove the information when forwarding requests to untrusted\n   nodes\
    \ or when the proxy does not have knowledge of any other proxy in\n   the route\
    \ set that is able to understand this header field.\n"
