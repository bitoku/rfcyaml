  - "1.  Introduction\n   When Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering
    (RSVP-TE) is\n   used for applications like Multicast Virtual Private Network
    (MVPN)\n   [RFC6513] and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4761], an egress\n
    \  Label Switching Router (LSR) receives the binding of the RSVP-TE\n   Label
    Switched Path (LSP) to an application and a payload identifier\n   using an \"out-of-band\"
    (OOB) mechanism (e.g., Border Gateway Protocol\n   (BGP)).  In such cases, the
    egress LSR cannot make correct forwarding\n   decisions until such OOB mapping
    information is received.\n   Furthermore, in order to apply the binding information,
    the egress\n   LSR needs to identify the incoming LSP on which traffic is coming.\n
    \  Therefore, non-Penultimate Hop Popping (non-PHP) behavior is required\n   to
    apply OOB mapping.  Non-PHP behavior requires the egress LSRs to\n   assign a
    non-NULL label for the LSP being signaled.\n   There are other applications that
    require non-PHP behavior.  When\n   RSVP-TE point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs are
    used to carry IP\n   multicast traffic non-PHP behavior enables a leaf LSR to
    identify the\n   P2MP TE LSP on which traffic is received.  Hence, the egress
    LSR can\n   determine whether traffic is received on the expected P2MP LSP and\n
    \  discard traffic that is not received on the expected P2MP LSP.  Non-\n   PHP
    behavior is also required to determine the context of upstream\n   assigned labels
    when the context is a MPLS LSP.  Non-PHP behavior may\n   also be required for
    MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) LSPs [RFC5921].\n   This document defines two
    new flags in the Attributes Flags TLV of\n   the LSP Attributes object defined
    in [RFC5420]: one flag for\n   communication of non-PHP behavior and one flag
    to indicate that the\n   binding of the LSP to an application and a payload identifier\n
    \  (Payload ID) needs to be learned via an out-of-band mapping\n   mechanism.
    \ As there is one-to-one correspondence between bits in the\n   Attribute Flags
    TLV and the Record Route Object (RRO) Attributes\n   subobject, corresponding
    flags to be carried in the RRO Attributes\n   subobject are also defined.\n   The
    procedures described in this document are equally applicable for\n   point-to-point
    (P2P) and P2MP LSPs.  Specification of the OOB\n   communication mechanism(s)
    is beyond the scope of this document.\n"

      an RSVP-TE LSP, this\n   document defines a new flag in the Attributes Flags
      TLV of the LSP\n   Attributes object defined in [RFC5420]:\n      Bit Number
      7: Non-PHP behavior flag\n   In order to indicate to the ingress LSR that the
      egress LSR\n   recognizes the \"Non-PHP behavior flag\", the same bit is used
      in the\n   Flags field of the Record Route Object (RRO) Attributes subobject.\n
      \  An ingress LSR sets the \"Non-PHP behavior flag\" to signal that the\n   egress
      LSRs SHOULD assign a non-NULL label for the LSP being\n   signaled.  This flag
      MUST NOT be modified by any other LSRs in the\n   network.  LSRs other than
      the egress LSRs SHOULD ignore this flag.\n   If an egress LSR receiving the
      Path message supports the LSP\n   Attributes object and the Attributes Flags
      TLV and also recognizes\n   the \"Non-PHP behavior flag\", it MUST allocate
      a non-NULL local label.\n   The egress LSR MUST also set the \"Non-PHP behavior
      flag\" in the Flags\n   field of the RRO Attributes subobject.\n   If the egress
      LSR\n   -  supports the LSP Attributes object but does not recognize the\n      Attributes
      Flags TLV; or\n   -  supports the LSP Attributes object and recognizes the Attributes\n
      \     Flags TLV, but does not recognize the \"Non-PHP behavior flag\";\n   then
      it silently ignores the request according to the processing\n   rules of [RFC5420].\n
      \  An ingress LSR requesting non-PHP behavior SHOULD examine the \"Non-\n   PHP
      behavior flag\" in the Flags field of the RRO Attributes subobject\n   and MAY
      send a Path Tear to the egress, which has not set the \"Non-\n   PHP behavior
      flag\".  An ingress LSR requesting non-PHP behavior MAY\n   also examine the
      label value corresponding to the egress LSR(s) in\n   the RRO and MAY send a
      Path Tear to the egress, which assigns a NULL\n   label value.\n   When signaling
      a P2MP LSP, a source node may wish to solicit an\n   individual response to
      the \"Non-PHP behavior flag\" from the leaf\n   nodes.  Given the constraints
      on how the LSP Attributes may be\n   carried in Path and Resv messages according
      to [RFC5420], in this\n   situation, the source node MUST use a separate Path
      message for each\n   leaf in networks where [RFC6510] is not supported.  In
      networks with\n   [RFC6510] deployed, either a single leaf per Path message
      or multiple\n   leaves per Path message MAY be used by the source node.\n"

    - "2.2.  Signaling OOB Mapping Indication\n   This document defines a single flag
      to indicate that the normal\n   binding mechanism of an RSVP session is overridden.
      \ The actual out-\n   of-band mappings are beyond the scope of this document.
      \ The flag is\n   carried in the Attributes Flags TLV of the LSP Attributes
      object\n   defined in [RFC5420] and is defined as follows:\n      Bit Number
      8: OOB mapping flag\n   In order to indicate to the ingress LSR that the egress
      LSR\n   recognizes the \"OOB mapping flag\", the following same bit is used
      in\n   the Flags field of the Record Route object (RRO) Attributes\n   subobject.\n
      \  An ingress LSR sets the \"OOB mapping flag\" to signal the egress LSR\n   that
      the binding of RSVP-TE LSP to an application and a payload\n   identifier is
      being signaled out-of-band.  This flag MUST NOT be\n   modified by any other
      LSRs in the network.  LSRs other than the\n   egress LSRs SHOULD ignore this
      flag.\n   When an egress LSR that supports the \"OOB mapping flag\" receives
      a\n   Path message with that flag set, the egress LSR  MUST set the \"OOB\n
      \  mapping flag\" in the Flags field of the RRO Attributes subobject.\n   The
      rest of the RSVP signaling proceeds as normal.  However, the LSR\n   MUST have
      received the OOB mapping before accepting traffic on the\n   LSP.  This implies
      that the egress LSR MUST NOT set up forwarding\n   state for the LSP before
      it receives the OOB mapping.\n   Note that the payload information SHOULD be
      supplied by the OOB\n   mapping.  If the egress LSR receives the payload information
      from OOB\n   mapping, then the LSR MUST ignore the L3PID (Layer 3 Protocol ID)
      in\n   the Label Request Object [RFC3209].\n   If the egress LSR\n   -  supports
      the LSP Attributes object but does not recognize the\n      Attributes Flags
      TLV; or\n   -  supports the LSP Attributes object and recognizes the Attributes\n
      \     Flags TLV, but does not recognize the \"OOB mapping flag\";\n   then it
      silently ignores the request according to the processing\n   rules of [RFC5420].\n
      \  An ingress LSR requesting OOB mapping SHOULD examine the \"OOB mapping\n
      \  flag\" in the Flags field of the RRO Attributes subobject and MAY send\n
      \  a Path Tear to the egress, which has not set the \"OOB mapping flag\".\n
      \  When signaling a P2MP LSP, a source node may wish to solicit an\n   individual
      response to the \"OOB mapping flag\" from the leaf nodes.\n   Given the constraints
      on how the LSP Attributes object may be carried\n   in Path and Resv messages
      according to [RFC5420], in this situation,\n   the source node MUST use a separate
      Path message for each leaf in\n   networks where [RFC6510] is not supported.
      \ In networks with\n   [RFC6510] deployed, either a single leaf per Path message
      or multiple\n   leaves per Path message MAY be used by the source node.\n   In
      deploying applications where the egress LSR receives the binding\n   of the
      RSVP-TE LSP to an application and a payload identifier using\n   an OOB mechanism,
      it is important to recognize that the OOB mapping\n   is sent asynchronously
      with respect to the signaling of RSVP-TE LSP.\n   The egress LSR only installs
      forwarding state for the LSP after it\n   receives the OOB mapping.  In deploying
      applications using an OOB\n   mechanism, an ingress LSR may need to know when
      the egress is\n   properly set up for forwarding (i.e., has received the OOB
      mapping).\n   How the ingress LSR determines that the LSR is properly set up
      for\n   forwarding at the egress LSR is beyond the scope of this document.\n
      \  Nonetheless, if the OOB mapping is not received by the egress LSR\n   within
      a reasonable time, the procedure defined in Section 2.4 to\n   tear down the
      LSP is followed.\n"

    - "2.3.  Relationship between OOB and Non-PHP Flags\n   The \"Non-PHP behavior
      flag\" and \"OOB mapping flag\" can appear and be\n   processed independently
      of each other.  However, as mentioned\n   earlier, in the context of the applications
      discussed in this\n   document, OOB mapping requires non-PHP behavior.  An ingress
      LSR\n   requesting the OOB mapping MAY also set the \"Non-PHP behavior flag\"\n
      \  in the LSP Attributes object in the Path message.\n"
    title: 2.3.  Relationship between OOB and Non-PHP Flags
  - contents:
    - "2.4.  Egress Procedure for Label Binding\n   RSVP-TE signaling completion and
      the OOB mapping information\n   reception happen asynchronously at the egress.
      \ As mentioned in\n   Section 2.2, egress waits for the OOB mapping before accepting\n
      \  traffic on the LSP.  Nonetheless, MPLS Operations, Administration,\n   and
      Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms, e.g., LSP ping and traceroute, as\n   defined
      in [RFC4379] and [RFC6425], are expected to work\n   independently of OOB mapping
      learning process.\n   In order to avoid unnecessary use of the resources and
      possible\n   black-holing of traffic, an egress LSR MAY send a Path Error message\n
      \  if the OOB mapping information is not received within a reasonable\n   time.
      \ This Path Error message SHOULD include the error code/sub-code\n   \"Notify
      Error / no OOB mapping received\" for all affected LSPs.  If a\n   notify request
      was included when the LSP was initially set up, a\n   Notify message (as defined
      in [RFC3473]) MAY also be used for\n   delivery of this information to the ingress
      LSR.  An egress LSR MAY\n   implement a cleanup timer for this purpose.  The
      time-out value is a\n   local decision at the egress, with a RECOMMENDED default
      value of 60\n   seconds.\n"

    of the\n   egress label reported in the RRO can cause the LSP to be torn down,\n
    \  additional security considerations for protecting labels assigned by\n   the
    egress node are required.  Security mechanisms as identified in\n   [RFC5920],
