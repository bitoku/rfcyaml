Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects to configure and/or monitor Virtual Private LAN services.
It needs to be used in conjunction with the Pseudowire (PW) Management Information Base (PW STD MIB from RFC 5601).
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines three MIB modules that can be used to manage VPLS (Virtual Private LAN Service) for transmission over a Packet Switched Network (PSN) using LDP [RFC4762] or BGP [RFC4761] signaling.
This MIB module provides generic management of VPLS services as defined by the IETF L2VPN Working Group.
Additional MIB modules are also defined for management of LDP VPLS and BGP VPLS services by the IETF L2VPN Working Group.
This document adopts the definitions, acronyms, and mechanisms described in [RFC3985].
Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms of [RFC3985] apply and will not be described again here.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "

The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The MIB structure for defining a VPLS service is composed from three MIB modules.
(They are referred to as "VPLS MIB" in the figure below.)
The first is the VPLS GENERIC MIB module, which configures general parameters of the VPLS service that are common to all types of VPLS services.
The second is the VPLS LDP MIB module, which configures VPLS LDP [RFC4762] specific parameters of the VPLS service.
The third is the VPLS BGP MIB module, which configures VPLS BGP [RFC4761] specific parameters of the VPLS service.
The arrows in Figure 1 indicate whether we can map data from one module into another.
1 Additionally, service specific modules may be defined in other documents.
An entry in the vplsConfigTable MUST exist for every VPLS service.
This table holds generic parameters that apply to a VPLS service which can be signaled via LDP or BGP.
A conceptual row can be created in the vplsConfigTable in one of the following ways: 1)
A Network Management System (NMS) creates a row in the vplsConfigTable using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
Set requests, which causes the node to create and start a new VPLS service.
The agent MUST support the creation of VPLS services in this way.
The agent MAY create a row in the vplsConfigTable automatically due to some auto discovery application, or based on configuration that is done through non SNMP applications.
At least one entry in the vplsPwBindTable MUST exist for each VPLS service.
This Binding table links one VPLS service with one or many pseudowires (defined in [RFC5601]).
Each pseudowire may be used as a spoke or as part of a mesh based on the parameters defined in this table.
For each VPLS service, an entry in the vplsBgpAdConfigTable MUST exist if Auto discovery has been enabled for that service.
This table stores the information required for auto discovery.
For each VPLS service, at least one entry in the vplsBgpRteTargetTable MUST exist if auto discovery has been configured for that service.
One service can import and export multiple Route Targets.
VPLS LDP MIB Module Usage
An entry in the vplsLdpConfigTable MUST be created by the agent for a VPLS service signaled using LDP. 4.3.
An entry in the vplsBgpConfigTable MUST be created by the agent for a VPLS service signaled using BGP.
Relations to Other MIB Modules
The vplsPwBindTable links the VPLS entry to the pwTable in [RFC5601].
The association of Media Access Control (MAC) addresses to VPLS entries is possible by adding a turnstile function to interpret the entries in [SNMP CONTEXT MAP MIB].
In [SNMP CONTEXT MAP MIB], there is a mapping from the vacmContextName [RFC3415] to dot1dBasePort [RFC4188] and vplsConfigIndex.
This mapping can be used to map the vplsConfigIndex to a dot1dBasePort in the BRIDGE  MIB.
This resulting value of dot1dBasePort can be used to access corresponding MAC addresses that belong to a particular vplsConfigIndex.
Unless all the necessary entries in the applicable tables have been created and all the parameters have been consistently configured in those tables, signaling cannot be performed from the local node, and the vplsConfigRowStatus should report 'notReady'.
Statistics can be gathered from the PW Performance tables in [RFC5601].
In this section, we provide an example of the use of the MIB objects described in Section 6 to set up a VPLS service over MPLS.
While this example is not meant to illustrate every permutation of the MIB, it is intended as an aid to understanding some of the key concepts.
It is meant to be read after going through the MIB itself.
In this example, a VPLS service (VPLS A) is set up using LDP for signaling the pseudowire.
The Binding between the VPLS service and the pseudowire is reflected in the VplsPwBindTable.
The pseudowire configuration is defined in RFC 5601.
This MIB module mentions the following documents: [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC3411], [RFC5601], [RFC4265], [RFC4364], [RFC4761], [RFC4762], [RFC6074], and [RFC3413].

"This object contains an appropriate value to be used for vplsConfigIndex when creating entries in the vplsConfigTable.
The value 0 indicates that no unassigned entries are available.
To obtain the value of vplsConfigIndex for a new entry in the vplsConfigTable, the manager issues a management protocol retrieval operation to obtain the current value of vplsConfigIndex.
After each retrieval operation, the agent should modify the value to reflect the next unassigned index.
After a manager retrieves a value the agent will determine through its local policy when this index value will be made available for reuse."

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The tables listed above contain read create/read write objects that can be used to configure or modify a LDP/BGP VPLS service.
Any improper configuration or modification of objects in these tables can disrupt VPLS services.
The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where possible for configuring these objects.
Specifically, SNMPv3 View based Access Control Model (VACM) and User based Security Model (USM) MUST be used with any v3 agent that provides SET access to these tables.
vplsNotificationMaxRate Setting this object to a very high value can cause a notification storm that may disrupt network service.
Most of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These readable objects are contained in the following tables:
vplsBgpADConfigTable vplsBgpRteTargetTable vplsLdpPwBindTable vplsLdpConfigTable vplsBgpConfigTable vplsBgpVETable vplsBgpPwBindTable SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
