- title: 1.  Abstract
  contents:
  - "1.  Abstract\n   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management\n\
    \   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in\n   TCP/IP-based\
    \ internets.  In particular, this memo defines MIB objects\n   for representing\
    \ DS1 physical interfaces.  Implementors should\n   consult in addition to this\
    \ memo the companion document that\n   describes that DS3 managed objects.\n"
- title: 2.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      RFC 1155 which\
    \ defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing\n      and naming objects\
    \ for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212\n      defines a more concise description\
    \ mechanism, which is wholly\n      consistent with the SMI.\n      RFC 1156 which\
    \ defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for\n      the Internet suite\
    \ of protocols.  RFC 1213, defines MIB-II, an\n      evolution of MIB-I based\
    \ on implementation experience and new\n      operational requirements.\n    \
    \  RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network\n      access\
    \ to managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for\
    \ the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 3.  Objects
  contents:
  - "3.  Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]\n   defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.\
    \  The name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which\
    \ specifies an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance\
    \ serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For\
    \ human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n  \
    \ DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type\
    \ defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that object type. \
    \ The ASN.1 language is used for\n   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely\
    \ restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are\
    \ explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The encoding of an object type is simply\
    \ how that object type is\n   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly\
    \ tied to the\n   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object\
    \ type\n   is represented when being transmitted on the network.\n   The SMI specifies\
    \ the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],\n   subject to the additional\
    \ requirements imposed by the SNMP.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Format of Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Format of Definitions\n   Section 5 contains contains the specification\
    \ of all object types\n   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are\
    \ defined using the\n   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions\n\
    \   specified in [13].\n"
- title: 4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview\n   These objects are used when the particular media being used\
    \ to\n   realize an interface is a DS1 physical interface.  At present, this\n\
    \   applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-\n   standard\
    \ MIB:\n               ds1 (18)\n               e1  (19)\n   The definitions contained\
    \ herein are based on the AT&T T-1\n   specifications and Extended Superframe\
    \ (ESF) format [9, 10], the\n   latter of which conforms to proposed ANSI specifications\
    \ [14, 15].\n   The various T1 and E1 line disciplines are similar enough that\n\
    \   separate MIBs are unwarranted, although there are some differences.\n   For\
    \ example, Loss of Frame is defined more rigorously in the ESF\n   specification\
    \ than in the D4 specification, but it is defined in\n   both.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Binding between Interfaces and CSUs
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Binding between Interfaces and CSUs\n   It should be noted that it is possible\
    \ to multiplex multiple bit\n   streams onto a single DS1 physical interface (CSU),\
    \ realizing\n   multiple interfaces from the perspective of the Internet-standard\n\
    \   MIB.  It is also possible to concatenate physical interfaces to\n   provide\
    \ a single logical interface.  As such, it is important to be\n   able to distinguish\
    \ between the indices used to identify the CSUs\n   attached to a node and the\
    \ indices used to identify an interface (in\n   the MIB sense) attached to a node.\n\
    \   Each agent which resides on a host which uses DS1 physical interfaces\n  \
    \ is required to assign a small, positive integer uniquely to each CSU.\n   This\
    \ is known as the \"CSUIndex\", and is used to distinguish between\n   different\
    \ CSUs attached to a node.  The CSUIndex is also used as the\n   \"key\" when\
    \ accessing tabular information about DS1 physical\n   interfaces.\n   The potentially\
    \ many-to-one binding between CSU indices and the\n   ifIndex value assigned to\
    \ each MIB interface are defined in the\n   ds1ConfigTable table defined in the\
    \ next section.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Objectives of this MIB Module
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Objectives of this MIB Module\n   There are numerous things that could\
    \ be included in a MIB for DS1\n   Interfaces: the management of multiplexors,\
    \ CSUs, DSUs, and the like.\n   The intent of this document is to facilitate the\
    \ common management of\n   CSUs, both in-chassis and external via proxy.  As such,\
    \ a design\n   decision was made up front to very closely align the MIB with the\
    \ set\n   of objects that can generally be read from CSUs that are currently\n\
    \   deployed, which is to say ESF CSUs conforming to AT&T specifications.\n  \
    \ However, by simple generalization of these objects, the MIB is also\n   made\
    \ applicable to D4 and G.704 devices.\n   To meet a requirement not easily satisfied\
    \ in other places, there is\n   one additional group present, the Fractional DS1\
    \ group.  This is\n   intended to facilitate the use of fractional DS1 devices\
    \ (i.e.,\n   devices which utilize a subset of the 8 bit channels available in\
    \ the\n   frame) over the managed CSUs.\n"
- title: 4.3.  DS1 Terminology
  contents:
  - "4.3.  DS1 Terminology\n   The terminology used in this document to describe error\
    \ conditions on\n   a T1 or E1 circuit monitored by a CSU are from references\
    \ [10], [11],\n   [14], and [15].\n          Out of Frame event\n            \
    \   An Out of Frame event is declared when the receiver\n               detects\
    \ two or more framing-bit errors within a 3\n               millisecond period,\
    \ or two or more errors out of five or\n               less consecutive framing-bits.\
    \  At this time, the framer\n               enters the Out of Frame State, and\
    \ starts searching for a\n               correct framing pattern.  The Out of\
    \ Frame state ends\n               when reframe occurs.\n          Loss of Signal\n\
    \               This event is declared upon observing 175 +/- 75\n           \
    \    contiguous pulse positions with no pulses of either\n               positive\
    \ or negative polarity (also called keep alive).\n          Code Violation Error\
    \ Event\n               A Code Violation Error Event is the occurrence of a\n\
    \               received Cyclic Redundancy Check code that is not\n          \
    \     identical to the corresponding locally-calculated code.\n          Bipolar\
    \ Violation\n               A Bipolar Violation, for B8ZS-coded signals, is the\n\
    \               occurrence of a received bipolar violation that is not\n     \
    \          part of a zero-substitution code.  It also includes other\n       \
    \        error patterns such as: eight or more consecutive zeros\n           \
    \    and incorrect parity.\n          Errored Seconds\n               An Errored\
    \ Second is a second with one or more Code\n               Violation Error Events\
    \ OR one or more Out of Frame\n               events.  In D4 and G.704 section\
    \ 2.1.3.2 (eg, G.704 which\n               does not implement the CRC), the presence\
    \ of Bipolar\n               Violations also triggers an Errored Second.\n   \
    \       Severely Errored Seconds\n               A Severely Errored Second is\
    \ a second with 320 or more\n               Code Violation Error Events OR one\
    \ or more Out of Frame\n               events.\n          Severely Errored Framing\
    \ Second\n               An Severely Errored Framing Second is a second with one\n\
    \               or more Out of Frame events.\n          Unavailable Signal State\n\
    \               This state is declared at the onset of 10 consecutive\n      \
    \         Severely Errored Seconds.  It is cleared at the onset of\n         \
    \      10 consecutive seconds with no Severely Errored Second.\n          Unavailable\
    \ Seconds\n               Unavailable Seconds are calculated by counting the number\n\
    \               of seconds that the CSU is in the Unavailable Signal\n       \
    \        State, including the initial 10 seconds to enter the\n              \
    \ state but not including the 10 seconds to exit the state.\n               Note\
    \ that any second that may be counted as an\n               Unavailable Second\
    \ may not be counted as an Errored\n               Second, a Severely Errored\
    \ Second.  Since the 10 Severely\n               Errored Seconds that comprise\
    \ the transition from the\n               available to Unavailable Signal State\
    \ may also be counted\n               as Errored Seconds, and Severely Errored\
    \ Seconds previous\n               to entering the state, these three counters\
    \ are adjusted\n               so that any second counted during this transition\
    \ is then\n               subtracted.  The 10 seconds in the transition from\n\
    \               unavailable to available may be counted as Errored\n         \
    \      Seconds.\n               A special case exists when the 10 or more second\
    \ period\n               crosses the 900 second statistics window boundary, as\
    \ the\n               foregoing description implies that the Severely Errored\n\
    \               Second and Unavailable Second counters must be adjusted\n    \
    \           when the Unavailable Signal State is entered.  Clearly,\n        \
    \       successive GETs of the affected ds1IntervalSES and\n               ds1IntervalUAS\
    \ objects will return differing values if\n               the first GET occurs\
    \ during the first few seconds of the\n               window.  This is viewed\
    \ as an unavoidable side-effect of\n               selecting the presently deployed\
    \ AT&T objects as a basis\n               for this memo.\n          Yellow Alarm\n\
    \               A Yellow Alarm is declared because of an incoming Yellow\n   \
    \            Signal from the far-end.  In effect, the circuit is\n           \
    \    declared to be a one way link.\n          Red Alarm\n               A Red\
    \ Alarm is declared because of an incoming Loss of\n               Signal, Loss\
    \ of Framing, Alarm Indication Signal.  After\n               a Red Alarm is declared,\
    \ the device sends a Yellow Signal\n               to the far-end.  The far-end,\
    \ when receives the Yellow\n               Signal, declares a Yellow Alarm.\n\
    \          Circuit Identifier\n               This is a character string specified\
    \ by the circuit\n               vendor, and is useful when communicating with\
    \ the vendor\n               during the troubleshooting process.\n"
