This memo describes a method of storing parameters needed for private key validation in the Private Key Information Syntax Specification as defined in PKCS#8 format (RFC 5208).
It is equally applicable to the alternative implementation of the Private Key Information Syntax Specification as defined in RFC 5958.
The approach described in this document encodes the parameters under a private enterprise extension and does not form part of a formal standard.
Introduction RSA or DSA private keys generated using the Shawe Taylor prime generation algorithm described in [FIPS186 4] allow for parameter validation, i.e., they verify whether the primes are actually prime and were correctly generated.
That is done by generating the parameters from a known seed and a selected hash algorithm.
Storing these parameters in a private key format such as the RSA Private Key Syntax from PKCS#1 [RFC8017] or common representations for DSA private keys does not allow information needed for validation to be attached to the parameters.
The purpose of this document is to describe such a method using the Private Key Information Syntax Specification as defined in [RFC5208] and
the alternative specification described in [RFC5958].
The approach described in this document encodes the parameters under a private enterprise extension and does not form part of a formal standard.
The encoding can be used as is or as the basis for a standard at a later time.
The information related to the validation parameters is stored as an attribute in the PrivateKeyInfo structure.
The attribute is identified by the id attr validation parameters object identifier and contains as AttributeValue a single ValidationParams structure.
The algorithm identifier in ValidationParams should be a hash algorithm identifier for the methods described in [FIPS186 4].
The ValidationParams sequence must be DER encoded [ITU T X690].
The following structure contains an RSA key generated using the algorithm from Section B.3.3 of [FIPS186 4], with SHA2 384 hash.
The seed used is 8af4328c87bebcec31e303b8f5537effcb6a91d947084d99a369823b36f01462 (hex encoded).

For compatibility, it is recommended that implementations following this document support generation and validation using the SHA2 384 hash algorithm.
The extension defined in this document is applicable both to the Private Key Information Syntax Specification (PKCS#8) [RFC5208] and to Asymmetric Key Packages [RFC5958].
All the considerations in [RFC5208] and [RFC5958] apply.
This document has no IANA actions.
This appendix provides non normative ASN.1 definitions for the structures described in this specification using ASN.1 as defined in [ITU T X680] and [RFC5912].
