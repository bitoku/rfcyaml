  - "1.  Introduction\n   The requirements for inter-area and inter-AS MPLS Traffic
    Engineering\n   (TE) have been developed by the Traffic Engineering Working Group
    (TE\n   WG) and have been stated in [RFC4105] and [RFC4216], respectively.\n   The
    framework for inter-domain Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\n   Traffic Engineering
    (TE) has been provided in [RFC4726].\n   [RFC5152] defines a technique for establishing
    an inter-domain\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) TE Label Switched Path (LSP) whereby
    the\n   path is computed during the signaling process on a per-domain basis\n
    \  by the entry boundary node of each domain (each node responsible for\n   triggering
    the computation of a section of an inter-domain TE LSP\n   path is always along
    the path of such TE LSP).  This path computation\n   technique fulfills some of
    the requirements stated in [RFC4105] and\n   [RFC4216] but not all of them.  In
    particular, it cannot guarantee to\n   find an optimal (shortest) inter-domain
    constrained path.\n   Furthermore, it cannot be efficiently used to compute a
    set of inter-\n   domain diversely routed TE LSPs.\n   The Path Computation Element
    (PCE) architecture is defined in\n   [RFC4655].  The aim of this document is to
    describe a PCE-based path\n   computation procedure to compute optimal inter-domain
    constrained\n   (G)MPLS TE LSPs.\n   Qualifying a path as optimal requires some
    clarification.  Indeed, a\n   globally optimal TE LSP placement usually refers
    to a set of TE LSPs\n   whose placements optimize the network resources with regards
    to a\n   specified objective function (e.g., a placement that reduces the\n   maximum
    or average network load while satisfying the TE LSP\n   constraints).  In this
    document, an optimal inter-domain constrained\n   TE LSP is defined as the shortest
    path satisfying the set of required\n   constraints that would be obtained in
    the absence of multiple domains\n   (in other words, in a totally flat IGP network
    between the source and\n   destination of the TE LSP).  Note that this requires
    the use of\n   consistent metric schemes in each domain (see Section 13).\n"

  - "3.  General Assumptions\n   In the rest of this document, we make the following
    set of\n   assumptions common to inter-area and inter-AS MPLS TE:\n   o  Each
    IGP area or Autonomous System (AS) is assumed to be Traffic\n      Engineering
    enabled.\n   o  No topology or resource information is distributed between domains\n
    \     (as mandated per [RFC4105] and [RFC4216]), which is critical to\n      preserve
    IGP/BGP scalability and confidentiality.\n   o  While certain constraints like
    bandwidth can be used across\n      different domains, other TE constraints (such
    as resource\n      affinity, color, metric, etc. [RFC2702]) could be translated
    at\n      domain boundaries.  If required, it is assumed that, at the domain\n
    \     boundary nodes, there will exist some sort of local mapping based\n      on
    policy agreement, in order to translate such constraints across\n      domain
    boundaries during the inter-PCE communication process.\n   o  Each AS can be made
    of several IGP areas.  The path computation\n      procedure described in this
    document applies to the case of a\n      single AS made of multiple IGP areas,
    multiple ASes made of a\n      single IGP area, or any combination of the above.
    \ For the sake of\n      simplicity, each AS will be considered to be made of
    a single area\n      in this document.  The case of an inter-AS TE LSP spanning\n
    \     multiple ASes, where some of those ASes are themselves made of\n      multiple
    IGP areas, can be easily derived from this case by\n      applying the BRPC procedure
    described in this document,\n      recursively.\n   o  The domain path (the set
    of domains traversed to reach the\n      destination domain) is either administratively
    predetermined or\n      discovered by some means that is outside of the scope
    of this\n      document.\n"
  title: 3.  General Assumptions
- contents:
  - "4.  BRPC Procedure\n   The BRPC procedure is a multiple-PCE path computation
    technique as\n   described in [RFC4655].  A possible model consists of hosting
    the PCE\n   function on boundary nodes (e.g., ABR or ASBR), but this is not\n
    \  mandated by the BRPC procedure.\n   The BRPC procedure relies on communication
    between cooperating PCEs.\n   In particular, the PCC sends a PCReq to a PCE in
    its domain.  The\n   request is forwarded between PCEs, domain-by-domain, until
    the PCE\n   responsible for the domain containing the LSP destination is reached.\n
    \  The PCE in the destination domain creates a tree of potential paths\n   to
    the destination (the Virtual Shortest Path Tree - VSPT) and passes\n   this back
    to the previous PCE in a PCRep.  Each PCE in turn adds to\n   the VSPT and passes
    it back until the PCE in the source domain uses\n   the VSPT to select an end-to-end
    path that the PCE sends to the PCC.\n   The BRPC procedure does not make any assumption
    with regards to the\n   nature of the inter-domain TE LSP that could be contiguous,
    nested,\n   or stitched.\n   Furthermore, no assumption is made on the actual
    path computation\n   algorithm in use by a PCE (e.g., it can be any variant of
    Constrained\n   Shortest Path First (CSPF) or an algorithm based on linear\n   programming
    to solve multi-constraint optimization problems).\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Domain Path Selection\n   The PCE-based BRPC procedure applies to the
      computation of an optimal\n   constrained inter-domain TE LSP.  The sequence
      of domains to be\n   traversed is either administratively predetermined or discovered
      by\n   some means that is outside of the scope of this document.  The PCC\n
      \  MAY indicate the sequence of domains to be traversed using the\n   Include
      Route Object (IRO) defined in [RFC5440] so that it is\n   available to all PCEs.
      \ Note also that a sequence of PCEs MAY be\n   enforced by policy on the PCC,
      and this constraint can be carried in\n   the PCEP path computation request
      (as defined in [PCE-MONITOR]).\n   The BRPC procedure guarantees to compute
      the optimal path across a\n   specific sequence of traversed domains (which
      constitutes an\n   additional constraint).  In the case of an arbitrary set
      of meshed\n   domains, the BRPC procedure can be used to compute the optimal
      path\n   across each domain set in order to get the optimal constrained path\n
      \  between the source and the destination of the TE LSP.  The BRPC\n   procedure
      can also be used across a subset of all domain sequences,\n   and the best path
      among these sequences can then be selected.\n"

      in domain i and j<= [X-en(i)]\n                         Figure 1: MP2P Tree\n
      \  Each link of tree VSPT(i) represents the shortest constrained path\n   between
      BN-en(j,i) and the TE LSP destination that satisfies the set\n   of required
      constraints for the TE LSP (bandwidth, affinities, etc.).\n   These are path
      segments to reach the TE LSP destination from\n   BN-en(j,i).\n   Note that
      PCE(i) only considers the entry BNs of domain(i), i.e.,\n   only the BNs that
      provide connectivity from domain(i-1).  In other\n   words, the set BN-en(k,i)
      is only made of those BNs that provide\n   connectivity from domain (i-1) to
      domain(i).  Furthermore, some BNs\n   may be excluded according to policy constraints
      (either due to local\n   policy or policies signaled in the path computation
      request).\n   Step 1:\n   First, the PCC needs to determine the PCE capable
      of serving its path\n   computation request (this can be done with local configuration
      or via\n   IGP discovery (see [RFC5088] and [RFC5089])).  The path computation\n
      \  request is then relayed until reaching a PCE(n) such that the TE LSP\n   destination
      resides in the domain(n).  At each step of the process,\n   the next PCE can
      either be statically configured or dynamically\n   discovered via IGP/BGP extensions.
      \ If no next PCE can be found or\n   the next-hop PCE of choice is unavailable,
      the procedure stops and a\n   path computation error is returned (see Section
      9).  If PCE(i-1)\n   discovers multiple PCEs for the adjacent domain(i), PCE(i)
      may select\n   a subset of these PCEs based on some local policies or heuristics.\n
      \  The PCE selection process is outside of the scope of this document.\n   Step
      2:\n   PCE(n) computes VSPT(n), the tree made of the list of shortest\n   constrained
      paths between every BN-en(j,n) and the TE LSP destination\n   using a suitable
      path computation algorithm (e.g., CSPF) and returns\n   the computed VSPT(n)
      to PCE(n-1).\n   Step i:\n   For i=n-1 to 2: PCE(i) computes VSPT(i), the tree
      made of the\n   shortest constrained paths between each BN-en(j,i) and the TE
      LSP\n   destination.  It does this by considering its own TED and the\n   information
      in VSPT(i+1).\n   In the case of inter-AS TE LSP computation, this also requires
      adding\n   the inter-AS TE links that connect the domain(i) to the domain(i+1).\n
      \  Step n:\n   Finally, PCE(1) computes the end-to-end shortest constrained
      path\n   from the source to the destination and returns the corresponding path\n
      \  to the requesting PCC in the form of a PCRep message as defined in\n   [RFC5440].\n
      \  Each branch of the VSPT tree (path) may be returned in the form of an\n   explicit
      path (in which case, all the hops along the path segment are\n   listed) or
      a loose path (in which case, only the BN is specified) so\n   as to preserve
      confidentiality along with the respective cost.  In\n   the latter case, various
      techniques can be used in order to retrieve\n   the computed explicit paths
      on a per-domain basis during the\n   signaling process, thanks to the use of
      path keys as described in\n   [PATH-KEY].\n   A PCE that can compute the requested
      path for more than one\n   consecutive domain on the path SHOULD perform this
      computation for\n   all such domains before passing the PCRep to the previous
      PCE in the\n   sequence.\n   BRPC guarantees to find the optimal (shortest)
      constrained inter-\n   domain TE LSP according to a set of defined domains to
      be traversed.\n   Note that other variants of the BRPC procedure relying on
      the same\n   principles are also possible.\n   Note also that in case of Equal
      Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) paths, more\n   than one path could be returned to the
      requesting PCC.\n"

    BRPC procedure\n   requires the knowledge of the traffic engineering attributes
    of the\n   inter-AS TE links.  The process by which the PCE acquires this\n   information
    is out of the scope of the BRPC procedure, which is\n   compliant with the PCE
    architecture defined in [RFC4655].\n   That said, a straightforward solution consists
    of allowing the ASBRs\n   to flood the TE information related to the inter-ASBR
    links although\n   no IGP TE is enabled over those links (there is no IGP adjacency
    over\n   the inter-ASBR links).  This allows the PCE of a domain to get entire\n
    \  TE visibility up to the set of entry ASBRs in the downstream domain\n   (see
    the IGP extensions defined in [RFC5316] and [RFC5392]).\n"

    because a PCE along the\n   domain does not recognize the procedure (VSPT flag
    of the RP object),\n   as stated in [RFC5440], the PCE sends a PCErr message to
    the upstream\n   PCE with an Error-Type=4 (Not supported object), Error-value=4\n
    \  (Unsupported parameter).  The PCE may include the parent object (RP\n   object)
    up to and including (but no further than) the unknown or\n   unsupported parameter.
    \ In this case where the unknown or unsupported\n   parameter is a bit flag (VSPT
    flag), the included RP object should\n   contain the whole bit flag field with
    all bits after the parameter at\n   issue set to zero.  The corresponding path
    computation request is\n   then cancelled by the PCE without further notification.\n
    \  If the BRPC procedure cannot be completed because a PCE along the\n   domain
    path recognizes but does not support the procedure, it MUST\n   return a PCErr
    message to the upstream PCE with an Error-Type \"BRPC\n   procedure completion

    objects are used to report a PCEP protocol error and are\n   characterized by

    additional information about the error\n   type.  Both the Error-Type and the

    and\n   inter-AS MPLS Traffic Engineering have been developed by the Traffic\n
    \  Engineering Working Group (TE WG) and have been stated in [RFC4105]\n   and
    [RFC4216], respectively.  Among the set of requirements, both\n   documents indicate
    the need for some solution that provides the\n   ability to compute an optimal
    (shortest) constrained inter-domain TE\n   LSP and to compute a set of diverse
    inter-domain TE LSPs.\n"

    - "10.1.  Diverse End-to-End Path Computation\n   PCEP (see [RFC5440]) allows
      a PCC to request the computation of a set\n   of diverse TE LSPs by setting
      the SVEC object's flags L, N, or S to\n   request link, node, or SRLG (Shared
      Risk Link Group) diversity,\n   respectively.  Such requests MUST be taken into
      account by each PCE\n   along the path computation chain during the VSPT computation.
      \ In the\n   context of the BRPC procedure, a set of diversely routed TE LSPs\n
      \  between two LSRs can be computed since the path segments of the VSPT\n   are
      simultaneously computed by a given PCE.  The BRPC procedure\n   allows for the
      computation of diverse paths under various objective\n   functions (such as
      minimizing the sum of the costs of the N diverse\n   paths, etc.).\n   By contrast,
      with a 2-step approach consisting of computing the first\n   path followed by
      computing the second path after having removed the\n   set of network elements
      traversed by the first path (if that does not\n   violate confidentiality preservation),
      one cannot guarantee that a\n   solution will be found even if such solution
      exists.  Furthermore,\n   even if a solution is found, it may not be the most
      optimal one with\n   respect to an objective function such as minimizing the
      sum of the\n   paths' costs, bounding the path delays of both paths, and so
      on.\n   Finally, it must be noted that such a 2-step path computation\n   approach
      is usually less efficient in terms of signaling delays since\n   it requires
      that two serialized TE LSPs be set up.\n"

    the proposed set of mechanisms always computes the shortest\n   path across multiple
    areas that obey the required set of constraints\n   with respect to a specified
    objective function.  Conversely, in the\n   case of inter-AS TE, in order for
    this path computation to be\n   meaningful, metric normalization between ASes
    may be required.  One\n   solution to avoid IGP metric modification would be for
    the service\n   providers to agree on a TE metric normalization scheme and use
    the TE\n   metric for TE LSP path computation (in that case, the use of the TE\n
