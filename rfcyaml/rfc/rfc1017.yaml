- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   Computer networks are critical to scientific research.  They\
    \ are\n   currently being used by portions of the scientific community to\n  \
    \ support access to remote resources (such as supercomputers and data\n   at collaborator's\
    \ sites) and collaborative work through such\n   facilities as electronic mail\
    \ and shared databases.  There is\n   considerable movement in the direction of\
    \ providing these\n   capabilities to the broad scientific community in a unified\
    \ manner,\n   as evidence by this workshop. In the future, these capabilities\
    \ will\n   even be required in space, as the Space Station becomes a reality as\n\
    \   a scientific research resource.\n   The purpose of this paper is to identify\
    \ the range of requirements\n   for networks that are to support scientific research.\
    \  These\n   requirements include the basic connectivity provided by the links\
    \ and\n   switches of the network through the basic network functions to the\n\
    \   user services that need to be provided to allow effective use of the\n   interconnected\
    \ network.  The paper has four sections.  The first\n   section discusses the\
    \ functions a user requires of a network.  The\n   second section discusses the\
    \ requirements for the underlying link and\n   node infrastructure while the third\
    \ proposes a set of specifications\n   to achieve the functions on an end-to-end\
    \ basis.  The fourth section\n   discusses a number of network-oriented user services\
    \ that are needed\n   in addition to the network itself.  In each section, the\
    \ discussion\n   is broken into two categories.  The first addresses near term\n\
    \   requirements: those capabilities and functions that are needed today\n   and\
    \ for which technology is available to perform the function.  The\n   second category\
    \ concerns long term goals: those capabilities for\n   which additional research\
    \ is needed.\n   This RFC was produced by the IAB Task force a Scientific Computing,\n\
    \   which is chartered to investigate advanced networking requirements\n   that\
    \ result from scientific applications.  Work reported herein was\n   supported\
    \ in part by Cooperative Agreement NCC 2-387 from the\n   National Aeronautics\
    \ and Space Administration (NASA) to the\n   Universities Space Research Association\
    \ (USRA).\n"
- title: 1.  NETWORK FUNCTIONS
  contents:
  - "1.  NETWORK FUNCTIONS\n   This section addresses the functions and capabilities\
    \ that networks\n   and particularly internetworks should be expected to support\
    \ in the\n   near term future.\n"
- title: Near Term Requirements
  contents:
  - "Near Term Requirements\n   There are many functions that are currently available\
    \ to subsets of\n   the user community.  These functions should be made available\
    \ to the\n   broad scientific community.\n"
- title: User/Resource Connectivity
  contents:
  - "User/Resource Connectivity\n   Undoubtedly the first order of business in networking\
    \ is to provide\n   interconnectivity of users and the resources they need.  The\
    \ goal in\n   the near term for internetworking should be to extend the\n   connectivity\
    \ as widely as possible, i.e. to provide ubiquitous\n   connectivity among users\
    \ and between users and resources.  Note that\n   the existence of a network path\
    \ between sites does not necessarily\n   imply interoperability between communities\
    \ and or resources using\n   non-compatible protocol suites.  However, a minimal\
    \ set of functions\n   should be provided across the entire user community, independent\
    \ of\n   the protocol suite being used.  These typically include electronic\n\
    \   mail at a minimum, file transfer and remote login capabilities must\n   also\
    \ be provided.\n"
- title: Home Usage
  contents:
  - "Home Usage\n   One condition that could enhance current scientific computing\
    \ would\n   be to extend to the home the same level of network support that the\n\
    \   scientist has available in his office environment.  As network access\n  \
    \ becomes increasingly widespread, the extension to the home will allow\n   the\
    \ user to continue his computing at home without dramatic changes\n   in his work\
    \ habits, based on limited access.\n"
- title: Charging
  contents:
  - "Charging\n   The scientific user should not have to worry about the costs of\
    \ data\n   communications any more than he worries about voice communications\n\
    \   (his office telephone), so that data communications becomes an\n   integral\
    \ and low-cost part of our national infrastructure.  This\n   implies that charges\
    \ for network services must NOT be volume\n   sensitive and must NOT be charged\
    \ back to the individual.  Either of\n   these conditions forces the user to consider\
    \ network resources as\n   scarce and therefore requiring his individual attention\
    \ to conserve\n   them.  Such attention to extraneous details not only detracts\
    \ from\n   the research, but fundamentally impacts the use and benefit that\n\
    \   networking is intended to supply.  This does not require that\n   networking\
    \ usage is free.  It should be either be low enough cost\n   that the individual\
    \ does not have to be accountable for \"normal\"\n   usage or managed in such\
    \ a manner that the individual does not have\n   to be concerned with it on a\
    \ daily basis.\n"
- title: Applications
  contents:
  - "Applications\n   Most applications, in the near term, which must be supported\
    \ in an\n   internetwork environment are essentially extensions of current ones.\n\
    \   Particularly:\n      Electronic Mail\n         Electronic mail will increase\
    \ in value as the extended\n         interconnectivity provided by internetworking\
    \ provides a much\n         greater reachability of users.\n      Multimedia Mail\n\
    \         An enhancement to text based mail which includes capabilities\n    \
    \     such as figures, diagrams, graphs, and digitized voice.\n      Multimedia\
    \ Conferencing\n         Network conferencing is communication among multiple\
    \ people\n         simultaneously.  Conferencing may or may not be done in \"\
    real\n         time\", that is all participants may not be required to be on-\n\
    \         line at the same time.  The multimedia supported may include\n     \
    \    text, voice, video, graphics, and possibly other capabilities.\n      File\
    \ Transfer\n         The ability to transfer data files.\n      Bulk Transfer\n\
    \         The ability to stream large quantities of data.\n      Interactive Remote\
    \ Login\n         The ability to perform remote terminal connections to hosts.\n\
    \      Remote Job Entry\n         The ability to submit batch jobs for processing\
    \ to remote hosts\n         and receive output.\n         Applications which need\
    \ support in the near term but are NOT\n         extensions of currently supported\
    \ applications include:\n      Remote Instrument Control\n         This normally\
    \ presumes to have a human in the \"control loop\".\n         This condition relaxes\
    \ the requirements on the (inter)network\n         somewhat as to response times\
    \ and reliability.  Timing would be\n         presumed to be commensurate with\
    \ human reactions and\n         reliability would not be as stringent as that\
    \ required for\n         completely automatic control.\n      Remote Data Acquisition\n\
    \         This supports the collection of experimental data where the\n      \
    \   experiment is remotely located from the collection center.\n         This\
    \ requirement can only be satisfied when the bandwidth,\n         reliability,\
    \ and predictability of network response are\n         sufficient.  This cannot\
    \ be supported in the general sense\n         because of the enormous bandwidth,\
    \ very high reliability,\n         and/or guaranteed short response time required\
    \ for many\n         experiments.\n   These last two requirements are especially\
    \ crucial when one considers\n   remote experimentation such as will be performed\
    \ on the Space\n   Station.\n"
- title: Capabilities
  contents:
  - "Capabilities\n   The above applications could be best supported on a network\
    \ with\n   infinite bandwidth, zero delay, and perfect reliability.\n   Unfortunately,\
    \ even currently feasible approximations to these levels\n   of capabilities can\
    \ be very expensive. Therefore, it can be expected\n   that compromises will be\
    \ made for each capability and between them,\n   with different balances struck\
    \ between different networks.  Because\n   of this, the user must be given an\
    \ opportunity to declare which\n   capability or capabilities is/are of most interest-most\
    \ likely\n   through a \"type-of-service\" required declaration.  Some examples\
    \ of\n   possible trade-offs: File Transport Normally requires high\n   reliability\
    \ primarily and high bandwidth secondarily. Delay is not as\n   important.\n \
    \     Bulk Transport\n         Some applications such as digitized video might\
    \ require high\n         bandwidth as the most important capability.  Depending\
    \ on the\n         application, delay would be second, and reliability of lesser\n\
    \         importance.  Image transfers of scientific data sometimes will\n   \
    \      invert the latter two requirements.\n      Interactive Traffic\n      \
    \   This normally requires low delay as a primary consideration.\n         Reliability\
    \ may be secondary depending on the application.\n         Bandwidth would usually\
    \ be of least importance.\n"

  contents:
  - "Standards\n    The use of standards in networking is directed toward\n    interoperability\
    \ and availability of commercial equipment.  However,\n    as stated earlier,\
    \ full interoperability across the entire\n    scientific community is probably\
    \ not a reasonable goal for\n    internetworking in the near term because of the\
    \ protocol mix now\n    present.  That is not to say, though, that the use of\
    \ standards\n    should not be pursued on the path to full user interoperability.\n\

- title: Long Term Goals
  contents:
  - "Long Term Goals\n   In the future, the internetwork should be transparent communications\n\
    \   between users and resources, and provide the additional network\n   services\
    \ required to make use of that communications.  A user should\n   be able to access\
    \ whatever resources are available just as if the\n   resource is in the office.\
    \  The same high level of service should\n   exist independent of which network\
    \ one happens to be on.  In fact,\n   one should not even be able to tell that\
    \ the network is there!\n   It is also important that people be able to work effectively\
    \ while at\n   home or when traveling.  Wherever one may happen to be, it should\
    \ be\n   possible to \"plug into\" the internetwork and read mail, access files,\n\
    \   control remote instruments, and have the same kind of environment one\n  \
    \ is used to at the office.\n   Services to locate required facilities and take\
    \ advantage of them\n   must also be available on the network.  These range from\
    \ the basic\n   \"white\" and \"yellow\" pages, providing network locations (addresses)\n\
    \   for users and capabilities, through to distributed data bases and\n   computing\
    \ facilities.  Eventually, this conglomeration of computers,\n   workstations,\
    \ networks, and other computing resources will become one\n   gigantic distributed\
    \ \"world computer\" with a very large number of\n   processing nodes all over\
    \ the world.\n"
- title: 2.  NETWORK CONNECTIVITY
  contents:
  - "2.  NETWORK CONNECTIVITY\n   By network connectivity, we mean the ability to\
    \ move packets from one\n   point to another.\n   Note that an implicit assumption\
    \ in this paper is that packet\n   switched networks are the preferred technology\
    \ for providing a\n   scientific computer network.  This is due to the ability\
    \ of such\n   networks to share the available link resources to provide\n   interconnection\
    \ between numerous sites and their ability to\n   effectively handle the \"bursty\"\
    \ computer communication requirement.\n   Note that this need not mean functional\
    \ interoperability, since the\n   endpoints may be using incompatible protocols.\
    \  Thus, in this\n   section, we will be addressing the use of shared links and\n\
    \   interconnected networks to provide a possible path.  In the next\n   section,\
    \ the exploitation of these paths to achieve functional\n   connectivity will\
    \ be addressed.\n   In this section, we discuss the need for providing these network\n\
    \   paths to a wide set of users and resources, and the characteristics\n   of\
    \ those paths.  As in other sections, this discussion is broken into\n   two major\
    \ categories.  The first category are those goals which we\n   believe to be achievable\
    \ with currently available technology and\n   implementations.  The second category\
    \ are those for which further\n   research is required.\n"
- title: Near Term Objectives
  contents:
  - "Near Term Objectives\n   Currently, there are a large number of networks serving\
    \ the\n   scientific community, including Arpanet, MFEnet, SPAN, NASnet, and\n\
    \   the NSFnet backbone.  While there is some loose correlation between\n   the\
    \ networks and the disciplines they serve, these networks are\n   organized more\
    \ based on Federal funding.  Furthermore, while there is\n   significant interconnectivity\
    \ between a number of the networks, there\n   is considerable room for more sharing\
    \ of these resources.\n   In the near term, therefore, there are two major requirement\
    \ areas;\n   providing for connectivity based on discipline and user community,\n\
    \   and providing for the effective use of adequate networking resources.\n"
- title: Discipline Connectivity
  contents:
  - "Discipline Connectivity\n   Scientists in a particular community/discipline need\
    \ to have access\n   to many common resources as well as communicate with each\
    \ other.  For\n   example, the quantum physics research community obtains funding\
    \ from\n   a number of Federal sources, but carries out its research within the\n\
    \   context of a scientific discourse.  Furthermore, this discourse often\n  \
    \ overlaps several disciplines.  Because networks are generally\n   oriented based\
    \ on the source of funding, this required connectivity\n   has in the past been\
    \ inhibited.  NSFnet is a major step towards\n   satisfying this requirement,\
    \ because of its underlying philosophy of\n   acting as an interconnectivity network\
    \ between supercomputer centers\n   and between state, regional, and therefore\
    \ campus networks.  This\n   move towards a set of networks that are interconnected,\
    \ at least at\n   the packet transport level, must be continued so that a scientist\
    \ can\n   obtain connectivity between his/her local computing equipment and the\n\
    \   computing and other resources that are needed, independently of the\n   source\
    \ of funds.\n   Obviously, actual use of those resources will depend on obtaining\n\
    \   access permission from the appropriate controlling organization.  For\n  \
    \ example, use of a supercomputer will require permission and some\n   allocation\
    \ of computing resources.  The lack of network access should\n   not, however,\
    \ be the limiting factor for resource utilization.\n"
- title: Communication Resource Sharing
  contents:
  - "Communication Resource Sharing\n   The scientific community is always going to\
    \ suffer from a lack of\n   adequate communication bandwidth and connections.\
    \  There are\n   requirements (e.g. graphic animation from supercomputers) that\n\
    \   stretch the capabilities of even the most advanced long-haul\n   networks.\
    \  In addition, as more and more scientists require\n   connection into networks,\
    \ the ability to provide those connections on\n   a network-centric basis will\
    \ become more and more difficult.\n   However, the communication links (e.g. leased\
    \ lines and satellite\n   channels) providing the underlying topology of the various\
    \ networks\n   span in aggregate a very broad range of the scientific community\n\
    \   sites.  If, therefore, the networks could share these links in an\n   effective\
    \ manner, two objectives could be achieved:\n      The need to add links just\
    \ to support a particular network\n      topology change would be decreased, and\n\
    \      New user sites could be connected more readily.\n   Existing technology\
    \ (namely the DARPA-developed gateway system based\n   on the Internet Protocol,\
    \ IP) provides an effective method for\n   accomplishing this sharing.  By using\
    \ IP gateways to connect the\n   various networks, and by arranging for suitable\
    \ cost-sharing, the\n   underlying connectivity would be greatly expanded and\
    \ both of the\n   above objectives achieved.\n"
- title: Expansion of Physical Structure
  contents:
  - "Expansion of Physical Structure\n   Unfortunately, the mere interconnectivity\
    \ of the various networks\n   does not increase the bandwidth available.  While\
    \ it may allow for\n   more effective use of that available bandwidth, a sufficient\
    \ number\n   of links with adequate bandwidth must be provided to avoid network\n\
    \   congestion.  This problem has already occurred in the Arpanet, where\n   the\
    \ expansion of the use of the network without a concurrent\n   expansion in the\
    \ trunking and topology has resulted in congestion and\n   consequent degradation\
    \ in performance.\n   Thus, it is necessary to augment the current physical structure\n\
    \   (links and switches) both by increasing the bandwidth of the current\n   configuration\
    \ and by adding additional links and switches where\n   appropriate.\n"
- title: Network Engineering
  contents:
  - "Network Engineering\n   One of the major deficiencies in the current system of\
    \ networks is\n   the lack of overall engineering.  While each of the various\
    \ networks\n   generally is well supported, there is woefully little engineering\
    \ of\n   the overall system.  As the networks are interconnected into a larger\n\
    \   system, this need will become more severe.  Examples of the areas\n   where\
    \ engineering is needed are:\n   Topology engineering-deciding where links and\
    \ switches should be\n   installed or upgraded.  If the interconnection of the\
    \ networks is\n   achieved, this will often involve a decision as to which networks\n\
    \   need to be upgraded as well as deciding where in the network those\n   upgrades\
    \ should take place.\n   Connection Engineering-when a user site desires to be\
    \ connected,\n   deciding which node of which network is the best for that site,\n\
    \   considering such issues as existing node locations, available\n   bandwidth,\
    \ and expected traffic patterns to/from that site.\n   Operations and Maintenance-monitoring\
    \ the operation of the overall\n   system and identifying corrective actions when\
    \ failures occur.\n"
- title: Support of Different Types of Service
  contents:
  - "Support of Different Types of Service\n   Several different end user applications\
    \ are currently in place, and\n   these put different demands on the underlying\
    \ structure.  For\n   example, interactive remote login requires low delay, while\
    \ file\n   transfer requires high bandwidth.  It is important in the\n   installation\
    \ of additional links and switches that care be given to\n   providing a mix of\
    \ link characteristics.  For example, high bandwidth\n   satellite channels may\
    \ be appropriate to support broadcast\n   applications or graphics, while low\
    \ delay will be required to support\n   interactive applications.\n"
- title: Future Goals
  contents:
  - "Future Goals\n   Significant expansion of the underlying transport mechanisms\
    \ will be\n   required to support future scientific networking.  These expansions\n\
    \   will be both in size and performance.\n"
- title: Bandwidth
  contents:
  - "Bandwidth\n   Bandwidth requirements are being driven higher by advances in\n\
    \   computer technology as well as the proliferation of that technology.\n   As\
    \ high performance graphics workstations work cooperatively with\n   supercomputers,\
    \ and as real-time remote robotics and experimental\n   control become a reality,\
    \ the bandwidth requirements will continue to\n   grow.  In addition, as the number\
    \ of sites on the networks increase,\n   so will the aggregate bandwidth requirement.\
    \  However, at the same\n   time, the underlying bandwidth capabilities are also\
    \ increasing.\n   Satellite bandwidths of tens of megabits are available, and\
    \ fiber\n   optics technologies are providing extremely high bandwidths (in the\n\
    \   range of gigabits).  It is therefore essential that the underlying\n   connectivity\
    \ take advantage of these advances in communications to\n   increase the available\
    \ end-to-end bandwidth.\n"
- title: Expressway Routing
  contents:
  - "Expressway Routing\n   As higher levels of internet connectivity occur there\
    \ will be a new\n   set of problems related to lowest hop count and lowest delay\
    \ routing\n   metrics. The assumed internet connectivity can easily present\n\
    \   situations where the highest speed, lowest delay route between two\n   nodes\
    \ on the same net is via a route on another network.  Consider\n   two sites one\
    \ either end of the country, but both on the same\n   multipoint internet, where\
    \ their network also is gatewayed to some\n   other network with high speed transcontinental\

    \ in section 2, it\n    is not adequate to simply provide the underlying connectivity\n\
    \    described in the previous section.  The network must provide a\n    certain\
    \ set of capabilities on an end-to-end basis.  In this\n    section, we discuss\

    \ requirements that arise in the connection of networks,\n   users, and resources.\n"
- title: Interoperability
  contents:
  - "Interoperability\n   A first-order requirement for scientific computer networks\
    \ (and\n   computer networks in general) is that they be interoperable with each\n\
    \   other, as discussed in the above section on connectivity.  A first\n   step\
    \ to accomplish this is to use IP.  The use of IP will allow\n   individual networks\
    \ built by differing agencies to combine resources\n   and minimize cost by avoiding\
    \ the needless duplication of network\n   resources and their management.  However,\
    \ use of IP does not provide\n   end-to-end interoperability.  There must also\
    \ be compatibility of\n   higher level functions and protocols.  At a minimum,\
    \ while commonly\n   agreed upon standards (such as the ISO developments) are\
    \ proceeding,\n   methods for interoperability between different protocol suites\
    \ must\n   be developed.  This would provide interoperability of certain\n   functions,\
    \ such as file transfer, electronic mail and remote login.\n   The emphasis, however,\
    \ should be on developing agreement within the\n   scientific community on use\
    \ of a standard set of protocols.\n"
- title: Access Control
  contents:
  - "Access Control\n   The design of the network should include adequate methods\
    \ for\n   controlling access to the network by unauthorized personnel.  This\n\
    \   especially includes access to network capabilities that are reachable\n  \
    \ via the commercial phone network and public data nets.  For example,\n   terminal\
    \ servers that allow users to dial up via commercial phone\n   lines should have\
    \ adequate authentication mechanisms in place to\n   prevent access by unauthorized\
    \ individuals.  However, it should be\n   noted that most hosts that are reachable\
    \ via such networks are also\n   reachable via other \"non-network\" means, such\
    \ as directly dialing\n   over commercial phone lines.  The purpose of network\
    \ access control\n   is not to insure isolation of hosts from unauthorized users,\
    \ and\n   hosts should not expect the network itself to protect them from\n  \
    \ \"hackers\".\n"
- title: Privacy
  contents:
  - "Privacy\n   The network should provide protection of data that traverses it in\
    \ a\n   way that is commensurate with the sensitivity of that data.  It is\n \
    \  judged that the scientific requirements for privacy of data traveling\n   on\
    \ networks does not warrant a large expenditure of resources in this\n   area.\

    \   the consumption of network resources.  Accounting of network\n   resources\
    \ is also important for the management of the network, and\n   particularly the\
    \ management of interconnections with other networks.\n   Proper use of the accounting\
    \ database should allow network management\n   personnel to determine the \"flows\"\
    \ of data on the network, and the\n   identification of bottlenecks in network\
    \ resources.  This capability\n   also has secondary value in tracking down intrusions\
    \ of the network,\n   and to provide an audit trail if malicious abuse should\
    \ occur.  In\n   addition, accounting of higher level network services (such as\n\
    \   terminal serving) should be kept track of for the same reasons.\n"
- title: Type of Service Routing
  contents:
  - "Type of Service Routing\n   Type of service routing is necessary since not all\
    \ elements of\n   network activity require the same resources, and the opportunities\n\
    \   for minimizing use of costly network resources are large.  For\n   example,\
    \ interactive traffic such as remote login requires low delay\n   so the network\
    \ will not be a bottleneck to the user attempting to do\n   work.  Yet the bandwidth\
    \ of interactive traffic can be quite small\n   compared to the requirements for\
    \ file transfer and mail service which\n   are not response time critical.  Without\
    \ type of service routing,\n   network resources must sized according to the largest\
    \ user, and have\n   characteristics that are pleasing to the most finicky user.\
    \  This has\n   major cost implications for the network design, as high-delay\
    \ links,\n   such as satellite links, cannot be used for interactive traffic\n\
    \   despite the significant cost savings they represent over terrestrial\n   links.\
    \  With type of service routing in place in the network\n   gateways, and proper\
    \ software in the hosts to make use of such\n   capabilities, overall network\
    \ performance can be enhanced, and\n   sizable cost savings realized.  Since the\
    \ IP protocol already has\n   provisions for such routing, such changes to existing\
    \ implementations\n   does not require a major change in the underlying protocol\n\
    \   implementations.\n"

    \ name to\n   address translation service also has similar advantages.  The DARPA\n\

  contents:
  - "Remote Procedure Call Libraries\n   In order to provide a standard library interface\
    \ so that distributed\n   network utilities can easily communicate with each other\
    \ in a\n   standard way, a standard Remote Procedure Call (RPC) library must be\n\
    \   deployed.  The computer industry has lead the research community in\n   developing\
    \ RPC implementations, and current implementations tend to\n   be compatible within\
    \ the same type of operating system, but not\n   across operating systems.  Nonetheless,\
    \ a portable RPC implementation\n   that can be standardized can provide a substantial\
    \ boost in present\n   capability to write operating system independent network\
    \ utilities.\n   If a new RPC mechanism is to be designed from scratch, then it\
    \ must\n   have enough capabilities to lure implementors away from current\n \
    \  standards.  Otherwise, modification of an existing standard that is\n   close\
    \ to the mark in capabilities seems to be in order, with the\n   cooperation of\
    \ vendors in the field to assure implementations will\n   exist for all major\

  contents:
  - "Remote Job Entry (RJE)\n   The capabilities of standard network RJE implementations\

    \   systems.  While the notion of RJE evokes memories of dated\n   technologies\
    \ such as punch cards, the concept is still valid, and is\n   favored as a means\
    \ of interaction with supercomputers by science\n   users.  All major supercomputer\

    \ modifiable for\n   use on the Internet.  Nonetheless, the capability for a network\
    \ user\n   to submit a job from a host and have its output delivered on a\n  \
    \ printer attached to a different host would be welcomed by most\n   science users.\

- title: Network Operation and Management Tools
  contents:
  - "Network Operation and Management Tools\n   The present state of internet technology\
    \ requires the use of\n   personnel who are, in the vernacular of the trade, called\

    \   These people are a scarce resource to begin with, and squandering\n   them\
    \ on day to day operational issues detracts from progress in the\n   more developmental\
    \ areas of networking.  The cause of this problem is\n   that a good part of the\
    \ knowledge for operating and managing a\n   network has never been written down\
    \ in any sort of concise fashion,\n   and the reason for that is because networks\
    \ of this type in the past\n   were primarily used as a research tool, not as\
    \ an operational\n   resource.  While the usage of these networks has changed,\
    \ the\n   technology has not adjusted to the new reality that a wizard may not\n\
    \   be nearby when a problem arises.  To insure that the network can\n   flexibly\

- title: Future Goals
  contents:
  - "Future Goals\n   The networks of the future must be able to support transparent\

    \ distributed archives and databases, and other network\n   services.  Access\
    \ to these resources is to be made widely available\n   to scientists, other researchers,\
    \ and support personnel located at\n   remote sites over a variety of internetted\
    \ connections.  Different\n   modes of access must be supported that are consonant\
    \ with the sorts\n   of resources that are being accessed, the data bandwidths\
    \ required\n   and the type of interaction demanded by the application.\n   Network\
    \ protocol enhancements will be required to support this\n   expansion in functionality;\
    \ mere increases in bandwidth are not\n   sufficient.  The number of end nodes\
    \ to be connected is in the\n   hundreds of thousands, driven by increasing use\
    \ of microprocessors\n   and workstations throughout the community.  Fundamentally\
    \ different\n   sorts of services from those now offered are anticipated, and\
    \ dynamic\n   bandwidth selection and allocation will be required to support the\n\
    \   different access modes.  Large-scale internet connections among\n   several\
    \ agency size internets will require new approaches to routing\n   and naming\
    \ paradigms.  All of this must be planned so as to\n   facilitate transition to\
    \ the ISO/OSI standards as these mature and\n   robust implementations are placed\
    \ in service and tuned for\n   performance.\n   Several specific areas are identified\
    \ as being of critical importance\n   in support of future network requirements,\
    \ listed in no particular\n   order:\n      Standards and Interface Abstractions\n\
    \         As more and different services are made available on these\n       \
    \  various networks it will become increasingly important to\n         identify\
    \ interface standards and suitable application\n         abstractions to support\
    \ remote resource access.  These\n         abstractions may be applicable at several\
    \ levels in the\n         protocol hierarchy and can serve to enhance both applications\n\
    \         functionality and portability.  Examples are transport or\n        \
    \ connection layer abstractions that support applications\n         independence\
    \ from lower level network realizations or interface\n         abstractions that\
    \ provide a data description language that can\n         handle a full range of\
    \ abstract data type definitions.\n         Applications or connection level abstractions\
    \ can provide means\n         of bridging across different protocol suites as\
    \ well as helping\n         with protocol transition.\n      OSI Transition and\
    \ Enhancements\n         Further evolution of the OSI network protocols and realization\n\
    \         of large-scale networks so that some of the real protocol and\n    \
    \     tuning issues can be dealt with must be anticipated.  It is\n         only\
    \ when such networks have been created that these issues can\n         be approached\
    \ and resolved.  Type-of-service and Expressway\n         routing and related\
    \ routing issues must be resolved before a\n         real transition can be contemplated.\
    \  Using the interface\n         abstraction approach just described will allow\
    \ definition now\n         of applications that can transition as the lower layer\
    \ networks\n         are implemented.  Applications gateways and relay functions\n\

    \ modest cost but high power computing\n         solutions will drive the development\
    \ of different network and\n         interconnect strategies as well as the infrastructure\
    \ for\n         managing this increased name space.  Hierarchical name\n     \
    \    management (as in domain based naming) and suitable transport\n         layer\
    \ realizations will be required to build networks that are\n         robust and\
    \ functional in the face of the anticipated\n         expansions.\n      Dynamic\
    \ Binding of Names to Addresses\n         Increased processor counts and increased\
    \ usage of portable\n         units, mobile units and lap-top micros will make\

    \ depending on the\n         definition of the particular bulletin board.  Currently\
    \ the\n         SMTP and UUCP protocols are used in the transport of postings\n\

    \ transport can be substituted without affecting the underlying\n         concept.\
    \  An effectively open-ended recipient list is specified\n         as the recipient\

    \ a particular set of\n         bulletin boards.  The user agent used to access\
    \ the Bulletin\n         Board may vary from host to host.  Some number of host\n\
