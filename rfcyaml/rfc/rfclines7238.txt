Abstract This document specifies the additional Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
status code 308 (Permanent Redirect).
Introduction HTTP defines a set of status codes for the purpose of redirecting a request to a different URI ([RFC3986]).
The history of these status codes is summarized in Section 6.4 of [RFC7231], which also classifies the existing status codes into four categories.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
status code indicates that the target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.
Clients with link editing capabilities ought to automatically re link references to the effective request URI (Section 5.5 of [RFC7230]) to one or more of the new references sent by the server, where possible.
The server SHOULD generate a Location header field ([RFC7231], Section 7.1.2) in the response containing a preferred URI reference for the new permanent URI.
The user agent MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection.
The server's response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).
A 308 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see [RFC7234], Section 4.2.2).
Note: This status code is similar to 301 (Moved Permanently)
([RFC7231], Section 6.4.2), except that it does not allow changing the request method from POST to GET.
Deployment Considerations Section 6 of [RFC7231] requires recipients to treat unknown 3xx status codes the same way as status code 300 Multiple Choices ([RFC7231], Section 6.4.1).
Thus, servers will not be able to rely on automatic redirection happening similar to status codes 301, 302, or 307.
Therefore, initial use of status code 308 will be restricted to cases where the server has sufficient confidence in the client's understanding the new code or when a fallback to the semantics of status code 300 is not problematic.
Note that many existing HTML based user agents will emulate a refresh when encountering an HTML <meta> refresh directive ([HTML]).
This can be used as another fallback.
example.com Server response: HTTP/1.1 308 Permanent Redirect Content Type:
text/html; charset UTF 8 Location:
http://example.com/new Content Length: 454 <!
The document has been moved to <a href "http://example.com/new" >http://example.com/new</a
All security considerations that apply to HTTP redirects apply to the 308 status code as well
(see Section 9 of [RFC7231]).
