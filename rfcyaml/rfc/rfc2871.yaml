- title: 2 Terminology
  contents:
  - "2 Terminology\n   We define the following terms. Note that there are other definitions\n\
    \   for these terms, outside of the context of gateway location. Our\n   definitions\
    \ aren't general, but refer to the specific meaning here:\n     Gateway: A device\
    \ with some sort of circuit switched network\n        connectivity and IP connectivity,\
    \ capable of initiating and\n        terminating IP telephony signaling protocols,\
    \ and capable of\n        initiating and terminating telephone network signaling\n\
    \        protocols.\n     End User: The end user is usually (but not necessarily)\
    \ a human\n        being, and is the party who is the ultimate initiator or\n\
    \        recipient of calls.\n     Calling Device: The calling device is a physical\
    \ entity which has\n        IP connectivity. It is under the direction of an end\
    \ user who\n        wishes to place a call. The end user may or may not be directly\n\
    \        controlling the calling device. If the calling device is a PC,\n    \
    \    the end user is directly controlling it. If, however, the\n        calling\
    \ device is a telephony gateway, the end user may be\n        accessing it through\
    \ a telephone.\n     Gatekeeper: The H.323 gatekeeper element, defined in [1].\n\
    \     SIP Server: The Session Initiation Protocol proxy or redirect\n        server\
    \ defined in [2].\n     Call Agent: The MGCP call agent, defined in [3].\n   \
    \  GSTN: The Global Switched Telephone Network, which is the worldwide\n     \
    \   circuit switched network.\n     Signaling Server: A signaling server is an\
    \ entity which is capable\n        of receiving and sending signaling messages\
    \ for some IP\n        telephony signaling protocol, such as H.323 or SIP.  Generally\n\
    \        speaking, a signaling server is a gatekeeper, SIP server, or\n      \
    \  call agent.\n     Location Server (LS): A logical entity with IP connectivity\
    \ which\n        has knowledge of gateways that can be used to terminate calls\n\
    \        towards the GSTN. The LS is the main entity that participates in\n  \
    \      Telephony Routing over IP. The LS is generally a point of\n        contact\
    \ for end users for completing calls to the telephony\n        network. An LS\
    \ may also be responsible for propagation of\n        gateway information to other\
    \ LS's. An LS may be coresident with\n        an H.323 gatekeeper or SIP server,\
    \ but this is not required.\n     Internet Telephony Administrative Domain (ITAD):\
    \ The set of\n        resources (gateways and Location Servers) under the control\
    \ of a\n        single administrative authority. End users are customers of an\n\
    \        ITAD.\n     Provider: The administrator of an ITAD.\n     Location Server\
    \ Policy: The set of rules which dictate how a\n        location server processes\
    \ information it sends and receives via\n        TRIP. This includes rules for\
    \ aggregating, propagating,\n        generating, and accepting information.\n\
    \     End User Policy: Preferences that an end user has about how a call\n   \
    \     towards the GSTN should be routed.\n     Peers: Two LS's are peers when\
    \ they have a persistent association\n        between them over which gateway\
    \ information is exchanged.\n     Internal peers: Peers that both reside within\
    \ the same ITAD.\n     External peers: Peers that reside within different ITADs.\n\
    \     Originating Location Server: A Location Server which first\n        generates\
    \ a route to a gateway in its ITAD.\n     Telephony Routing Information Base (TRIB):\
    \ The database of gateways\n        an LS builds up as a result of participation\
    \ in TRIP.\n"
- title: 3 Motivation and Problem Definition
  contents:
  - "3 Motivation and Problem Definition\n   As IP telephony gateways grow in terms\
    \ of numbers and usage, managing\n   their operation will become increasingly\
    \ complex. One of the\n   difficult tasks is that of gateway location, also known\
    \ as gateway\n   selection, path selection, gateway discovery, and gateway routing.\n\
    \   The problem occurs when a calling device (such as a telephony gateway\n  \
    \ or a PC with IP telephony software) on an IP network needs to\n   complete a\
    \ call to a phone number that represents a terminal on a\n   circuit switched\
    \ telephone network. Since the intended target of the\n   call resides in a circuit\
    \ switched network, and the caller is\n   initiating the call from an IP host,\
    \ a telephony gateway must be\n   used. The gateway functions as a conversion\
    \ point for media and\n   signaling, converting between the protocols used on\
    \ the IP network,\n   and those used in the circuit switched network.\n   The\
    \ gateway is, in essence, a relaying point for an application layer\n   signaling\
    \ protocol. There may be many gateways which could possibly\n   complete the call\
    \ from the calling device on the IP network to the\n   called party on the circuit\
    \ switched network. Choosing such a gateway\n   is a non-trivial process. It is\
    \ complicated because of the following\n   issues:\n     Number of Candidate Gateways:\
    \ It is anticipated that as IP\n        telephony becomes widely deployed, the\
    \ number of telephony\n        gateways connecting the Internet to the GSTN will\
    \ become large.\n        Attachment to the GSTN means that the gateway will have\n\
    \        connectivity to the nearly one billion terminals reachable on\n     \
    \   this network. This means that every gateway could theoretically\n        complete\
    \ a call to any terminal on the GSTN.  As such, the\n        number of candidate\
    \ gateways for completing a call may be very\n        large.\n     Business Relationships:\
    \ In reality, the owner of a gateway is\n        unlikely to make the gateway\
    \ available to any user who wishes to\n        connect to it. The gateway provides\
    \ a useful service, and incurs\n        cost when completing calls towards the\
    \ circuit switched network.\n        As a result, providers of gateways will,\
    \ in many cases, wish to\n        charge for use of these gateways. This may restrict\
    \ usage of the\n        gateway to those users who have, in some fashion, an established\n\
    \        relationship with the gateway provider.\n     Provider Policy: In all\
    \ likelihood, an end user who wishes to make\n        use of a gateway service\
    \ will not compensate the gateway\n        provider directly. The end user may\
    \ have a relationship with an\n        IP telephony service provider which acts\
    \ as an intermediary to\n        providers of gateways. The IP telephony service\
    \ provider may\n        have gateways of its own as well. In this case, the IP\
    \ telephony\n        service provider may have policies regarding the usage of\n\
    \        various gateways from other providers by its customers. These\n     \
    \   policies must figure into the selection process.\n     End User Policy: In\
    \ some cases, the end user may have specific\n        requirements regarding the\
    \ gateway selection. The end user may\n        need a specific feature, or have\
    \ a preference for a certain\n        provider. These need to be taken into account\
    \ as well.\n     Capacity: All gateways are not created equal. Some are large,\n\
    \        capable of supporting hundreds or even thousands of simultaneous\n  \
    \      calls. Others, such as residential gateways, may only support\n       \
    \ one or two calls. The process for selecting gateways should\n        allow gateway\
    \ capacity to play a role. It is particularly\n        desirable to support some\
    \ form of load balancing across gateways\n        based on their capacities.\n\
    \     Protocol and Feature Compatibilities: The calling party may be\n       \
    \ using a specific signaling or media protocol that is not\n        supported\
    \ by all gateways.\n   From these issues, it becomes evident that the selection\
    \ of a gateway\n   is driven in large part by the policies of various parties,\
    \ and by\n   the relationships established between these parties. As such, there\n\
    \   cannot be a global \"directory of gateways\" in which users look up\n   phone\
    \ numbers. Rather, information on availability of gateways must\n   be exchanged\
    \ by providers, and subject to policy, made available\n   locally and then propagated\
    \ to other providers. This would allow each\n   provider to build up its own local\
    \ database of available gateways -\n   such a database being very different for\
    \ each provider depending on\n   policy.\n   From this, we can conclude that a\
    \ protocol is needed between\n   administrative domains for exchange of gateway\
    \ routing information.\n   The protocol that provides these functions is Telephony\
    \ Routing over\n   IP (TRIP). TRIP provides a specific set of functions:\n   \
    \   o Establishment and maintenance of peering relationships between\n       \
    \ providers;\n      o Exchange and synchronization of telephony gateway routing\n\
    \        information between providers;\n      o Prevention of stable routing\
    \ loops for IP telephony signaling\n        protocols;\n      o Propagation of\
    \ learned gateway routing information to other\n        providers in a timely\
    \ and scalable fashion;\n      o Definition of the syntax and semantics of the\
    \ data which\n        describe telephony gateway routes.\n   TRIP can be generally\
    \ summarized as an inter-domain IP telephony\n   gateway routing protocol.\n"
- title: 4 Related Problems
  contents:
  - "4 Related Problems\n   At a high level, the problem TRIP solves appears to be\
    \ a mapping\n   problem: given an input telephone number, determine, based on\
    \ some\n   criteria, the address of a telephony gateway. For this reason, the\n\
    \   gateway location problem is often called a \"phone number to IP\n   address\
    \ translation problem\". This is an over-simplification,\n   however. There are\
    \ at least three separate problems, all of which can\n   be classified as a \"\
    phone number to IP address translation problem\",\n   and only one of which is\
    \ addressed by TRIP:\n      o Given a phone number that corresponds to a terminal\
    \ on a\n        circuit switched network, determine the IP address of a\n    \
    \    gateway capable of completing a call to that phone number.\n      o Given\
    \ a phone number that corresponds to a specific host on\n        the Internet\
    \ (this host may have a phone number in order to\n        facilitate calls to\
    \ it from the circuit switched network),\n        determine the IP address of\
    \ this host.\n      o Given a phone number that corresponds to a user of a terminal\n\
    \        on a circuit switched network, determine the IP address of an\n     \
    \   IP terminal which is owned by the same user.\n   The last of these three mapping\
    \ functions is useful for services\n   where the PC serves as an interface for\
    \ the phone. One such service\n   is the delivery of an instant message to a PC\
    \ when the user's phone\n   rings. To deliver this service, a switch in the GSTN\
    \ is routing a\n   call towards a phone number. It wishes to send an Instant Message\
    \ to\n   the PC for this user. This switch must somehow have access to the IP\n\
    \   network, in order to determine the IP address of the PC corresponding\n  \
    \ to the user with the given phone number. The mapping function is a\n   name\
    \ to address translation problem, where the name happens to be\n   represented\
    \ by a string of digits. Such a translation function is\n   best supported by\
    \ directory protocols. This problem is not addressed\n   by TRIP.\n   The second\
    \ of these mappings is needed to facilitate calls from\n   traditional phones\
    \ to IP terminals. When a user on the GSTN wishes to\n   call a user with a terminal\
    \ on the IP network, they need to dial a\n   number identifying that terminal.\
    \ This number could be an IP address.\n   However, IP addresses are often ephemeral,\
    \ assigned on demand by DHCP\n   [4] or by dialup network access servers using\
    \ PPP [5]. The number\n   could be a hostname, obtained through some translation\
    \ of groups of\n   numbers to letters. However, this is cumbersome. It has been\
    \ proposed\n   instead to assign phone numbers to IP telephony terminals. A caller\n\
    \   on the GSTN would then dial this number as they would any other. This\n  \
    \ number serves as an alternate name for the IP terminal, in much the\n   same\
    \ way its hostname serves as a name. A switch in the GSTN must\n   then access\
    \ the IP network, and obtain the mapping from this number\n   to an IP address\
    \ for the PC. Like the previous case, this problem is\n   a name to address translation\
    \ problem, and is best handled by a\n   directory protocol. It is not addressed\
    \ by TRIP.\n   The first mapping function, however, is fundamentally an address\
    \ to\n   route translation problem. It is this problem which is considered by\n\
    \   TRIP. As discussed in Section 3, this mapping depends on local\n   factors\
    \ such as policies and provider relationships. As a result, the\n   database of\
    \ available gateways is substantially different for each\n   provider, and needs\
    \ to be built up through specific inter-provider\n   relationships. It is for\
    \ this reason that a directory protocol is not\n   appropriate for TRIP, whereas\
    \ it is appropriate for the others.\n"
- title: 5 Relationship with BGP
  contents:
  - "5 Relationship with BGP\n   TRIP can be classified as a close cousin of inter-domain\
    \ IP routing\n   protocols, such as BGP [6]. However, there are important differences\n\
    \   between BGP and TRIP:\n      o TRIP runs at the application layer, not the\
    \ network layer,\n        where BGP resides.\n      o TRIP runs between servers\
    \ which may be separated by many\n        intermediate networks and IP service\
    \ providers. BGP runs\n        between routers that are usually adjacent.\n  \
    \    o The information exchanged between TRIP peers describes routes\n       \
    \ to application layer devices, not IP routers, as is done with\n        BGP.\n\
    \      o TRIP assumes the existence of an underlying IP transport\n        network.\
    \ This means that servers which exchange TRIP routing\n        information need\
    \ not act as forwarders of signaling messages\n        that are routed based on\
    \ this information. This is not true in\n        BGP, where the peers must also\
    \ act as forwarding points (or\n        name an adjacent forwarding hop) for IP\
    \ packets.\n      o The purpose of TRIP is not to establish global connectivity\n\
    \        across all ITADs. It is perfectly reasonable for there to be\n      \
    \  many small islands of TRIP connectivity. Each island\n        represents a\
    \ closed set of administrative relationships.\n        Furthermore, each island\
    \ can still have complete connectivity\n        to the entire GSTN. This is in\
    \ sharp contrast to BGP, where\n        the goal is complete connectivity across\
    \ the Internet. If a\n        set of AS's are isolated from some other set because\
    \ of a BGP\n        disconnect, no IP network connectivity exists between them.\n\
    \      o Gateway routes are far more complex than IP routes (since they\n    \
    \    reside at the application, not the network layer), with many\n        more\
    \ parameters which may describe them.\n      o BGP exchanges prefixes which represent\
    \ a portion of the IP\n        name space. TRIP exchanges phone number ranges,\
    \ representing a\n        portion of the GSTN numbering space. The organization\
    \ and\n        hierarchies in these two namespaces are different.\n   These differences\
    \ means that TRIP borrows many of the concepts from\n   BGP, but that it is still\
    \ a different protocol with its own specific\n   set of functions.\n"
- title: 6 Example Applications of TRIP

  - "6 Example Applications of TRIP\n   TRIP is a general purpose tool for exchanging\
    \ IP telephony routes\n   between providers. TRIP does not, in any way, dictate\
    \ the structure\n   or nature of the relationships between those providers. As\
    \ a result,\n   TRIP has applications for a number of common cases for IP telephony.\n"

  - "6.1 Clearinghouses\n   A clearinghouse is a provider that serves as an exchange\
    \ point\n   between a number of other providers, called the members of the\n \
    \  clearinghouse. Each member signs on with the clearinghouse. As part\n   of\
    \ the agreement, the member makes their gateways available to the\n   other members\
    \ of the clearinghouse. In exchange, the members have\n   access to the gateways\
    \ owned by the other members of the\n   clearinghouse. When a gateway belonging\
    \ to one member makes a call,\n   the clearinghouse plays a key role in determining\
    \ which member\n   terminates the call.\n   TRIP can be applied here as the tool\
    \ for exchanging routes between\n   the members and the clearinghouse. This is\
    \ shown in Figure 1.\n   There are 6 member companies, M1 through M6. Each uses\

- title: 8.1 IT Administrative Domain
  contents:
  - "8.1 IT Administrative Domain\n   An IT administrative domain consists of zero\
    \ or more gateways, at\n   least one Location Server, and zero or more end users.\
    \ The gateways\n   and LS's are those which are under the administrative control\
    \ of a\n   single authority. This means that there is one authority responsible\n\
    \   for dictating the policies and configuration of the gateways and\n   LS's.\n\
    \   An IT administrative domain need not be the same as an autonomous\n   system.\
    \ While an AS represents a set of physically connected\n   networks, an IT administrative\
    \ domain may consist of elements on\n   disparate networks, and even within disparate\
    \ autonomous systems.\n   The end users within an IT administrative domain are\
    \ effectively the\n   customers of that IT administrative domain. They are interested\
    \ in\n   completing calls towards the telephone network, and thus need access\n\
    \   to gateways. An end user may be a customer of one IT administrative\n   domain\
    \ for one call, and then a customer of a different one for the\n   next call.\n\
    \   An IT administrative domain need not have any gateways. In this case,\n  \
    \ its LS learns about gateways in other domains, and makes these\n   available\
    \ to the end users within its domain. In this case, the IT\n   administrative\
    \ domain is effectively a virtual IP telephony gateway\n   provider. This is because\
    \ it provides gateway service, but may not\n   actually own or administer any\
    \ gateways.\n   An IT administrative domain need not have any end users. In this\n\
    \   case, it provides \"wholesale\" gateway service, making its gateways\n   available\
    \ to customers in other IT administrative domains.\n   An IT administrative domain\
    \ need not have gateways nor end users. In\n   this case, the ITAD only has LS's.\
    \ The ITAD acts as a reseller,\n   learning about other gateways, and then aggregating\
    \ and propagating\n   this information to other ITAD's which do have customers.\n"
- title: 8.2 Gateway
  contents:
  - "8.2 Gateway\n   A gateway is a logical device which has both IP connectivity\
    \ and\n   connectivity to some other network, usually a public or private\n  \
    \ telephone network. The function of the gateway is to translate the\n   media\
    \ and signaling protocols from one network technology to the\n   other, achieving\
    \ a transparent connection for the users of the\n   system.\n   A gateway has\
    \ a number of attributes which characterize the service\n   it provides. Most\
    \ fundamental among these are the range of phone\n   numbers to which it is willing\
    \ to provide service. This range may be\n   broken into subranges, and associated\
    \ with each, some cost metric or\n   cost token. This token indicates some notion\
    \ of cost or preference\n   for completing calls for this part of the telephone\
    \ number range.\n   A gateway has attributes which characterize the volume of\
    \ service\n   which it can provide. These include the number of ports it has (i.e.,\n\
    \   the number of simultaneous phone calls it can support), and the\n   access\
    \ link speed. These two together represent some notion of the\n   capacity of\
    \ the gateway. The metric is useful for allowing Location\n   Servers to decide\
    \ to route calls to gateways in proportion to the\n   value of the metric, thus\
    \ achieving a simple form of load balancing.\n   A gateway also has attributes\
    \ which characterize the type of service\n   it provides. This includes, but is\
    \ not limited to, signaling\n   protocols supported, telephony features provided,\
    \ speech codecs\n   understood, and encryption algorithms which are implemented.\
    \ These\n   attributes may be important in selecting a gateway. In the absence\
    \ of\n   baseline required features across all gateways (an admirable, but\n \
    \  difficult goal), such a set of attributes is required in order to\n   select\
    \ a gateway with which communications can be established. End\n   users which\
    \ have specific requirements for the call (such as a user\n   requesting a business\
    \ class call, in which case certain call features\n   may need to be supported)\
    \ may wish to make use of such information as\n   well.\n   Some of these attributes\
    \ are transported in TRIP to describe\n   gateways, and others are not. This depends\
    \ on whether the metric can\n   be reasonably aggregated, and whether it is something\
    \ which must be\n   conveyed in TRIP before the call is set up (as opposed to\
    \ negotiated\n   or exchanged by the signaling protocols themselves). The philosophy\n\
    \   of TRIP is to keep it simple, and to favor scalability above\n   abundance\
    \ of information. TRIP's attribute set is readily extensible.\n   Flags provide\
    \ information that allow unknown attributes to be\n   reasonably processed by\
    \ an LS.\n"
- title: 8.3 End Users
  contents:
  - "8.3 End Users\n   An end user is an entity (usually a human being) which wishes\
    \ to\n   complete a call through a gateway from an IP network to a terminal on\n\
    \   a telephone network. An end user may be a user logged on at a PC with\n  \
    \ some Internet telephony software. The end user may also be connected\n   to\
    \ the IP network through an ingress telephone gateway, which the\n   user accessed\
    \ from telephone handset. This is the case for what is\n   referred to as \"phone\
    \ to phone\" service with the IP network used for\n   interexchange transport.\n\
    \   End users may, or may not be aware that there is a telephony routing\n   service\
    \ running when they complete a call towards the telephone\n   network. In cases\
    \ where they are aware, end users may have\n   preferences for how a call is completed.\
    \ These preferences might\n   include call features which must be supported, quality\
    \ metrics, owner\n   or administrator, and cost preferences.\n   TRIP does not\
    \ dictate how these preferences are combined with those\n   of the provider to\
    \ yield the final gateway selection. Nor does TRIP\n   support the transport of\
    \ these preferences to the LS. This transport\n   can be accomplished using the\
    \ front end, or by some non-protocol\n   means.\n"
- title: 8.4 Location Server
  contents:
  - "8.4 Location Server\n   The Location Server (LS) is the main functional entity\
    \ of TRIP.  It\n   is a logical device which has access to a database of gateways,\n\
    \   called the Telephony Routing Information Base (TRIB). This database\n   of\
    \ gateways is constructed by combining the set of locally available\n   gateways\
    \ and the set of remote gateways (learned through TRIP) based\n   on policy. The\
    \ LS also exports a set of gateways to its peer LS's in\n   other ITAD's. The\

    \ 5: Flow of Information in TRIP\n   The TRIB built up in the LS allows it to\
    \ make decisions about IP\n   telephony call routing. When a signaling message\
    \ arrives at a\n   signaling server, destined for a telephone network address,\
    \ the LS's\n   database can provide information which is useful for determining\
    \ a\n   gateway or an additional signaling server to forward the signaling\n \
    \  message to. For this reason, an LS may be coresident with a signaling\n   server.\
    \ When they are not coresident, some means of communication\n   between the LS\
    \ and the signaling server is needed. This communication\n   is not specifically\
    \ addressed by TRIP, although it is possible that\n   TRIP might meet the needs\
    \ of such a protocol.\n   An ITAD must have at least one LS in order to participate\
    \ in TRIP.\n   An ITAD may have more than one LS, for purposes of load balancing,\n\
    \   ease of management, or any other reason. In that case, communications\n  \
    \ between these LS's may need to take place in order to synchronize\n   databases\
    \ and share information learned from external peers. This is\n   often referred\
    \ to as the interior component of an inter-domain\n   protocol. TRIP includes\
    \ such a function.\n   Figure 5 shows an LS learning about gateways within the\
    \ ITAD by means\n   of an intra-domain protocol. There need not be an intra-domain\n\
    \   protocol. An LS may operate without knowledge of any locally run\n   gateways.\
    \ Or, it may know of locally run gateways, but through static\n   configuration.\
    \ An LS may also be co-resident with a gateway, in which\n   case it would know\

- title: 9.1 Gateways and Location Servers
  contents:
  - "9.1 Gateways and Location Servers\n   Gateways must somehow propagate information\
    \ about their\n   characteristics to an LS within the same ITAD. This LS may,\
    \ in turn,\n   further propagate this information outside of the ITAD by means\
    \ of\n   TRIP. This LS is called an originating LS for that gateway. When an\n\
    \   LS nis not coresident with the gateway, the means by which the\n   information\
    \ gets propagated is not within the scope of TRIP.  The\n   protocol used to accomplish\
    \ this is generally called an intra-domain\n   protocol.\n   One way in which\
    \ the information can be propagated is with the\n   Service Location Protocol\
    \ (SLP) [7]. The gateway can contain a\n   Service Agent (SA), and the LS can\
    \ act as a Directory Agent (DA). SLP\n   defines procedures by which service information\
    \ is automatically\n   propagated to DA's from SA's. In this fashion, an LS can\
    \ learn about\n   gateways in the ITAD.\n   An alternate mechanism for the intra-domain\
    \ protocol is via the\n   registration procedures of SIP or H.323. The registration\
    \ procedures\n   provide a means by which users inform a gatekeeper or SIP server\n\
    \   about their address. Such a registration procedure could be extended\n   to\
    \ allow a gateway to effectively register as well.\n   LDAP [8] might also be\
    \ used for the intra-domain protocol.  A gateway\n   can use LDAP to add an entry\
    \ for itself into the database. If the LS\n   also plays the role of the LDAP\
    \ server, it will be able to learn\n   about all those gateways in its ITAD.\n\
    \   The intra-domain protocol which is used may be different from IT\n   administrative\
    \ domain to IT administrative domain, and is a matter of\n   local configuration.\
    \ There may also be more than one intra-domain\n   protocol in a particular ITAD.\
    \ An LS can also function without an\n   intra-domain protocol. It may learn about\
    \ gateways through static\n   configuration, or may not know of any local gateways.\n"
- title: 9.2 Location Server to Location Server
  contents:
  - "9.2 Location Server to Location Server\n   The interaction between LS's is what\
    \ is defined by TRIP.  LS's within\n   the same ITAD use TRIP to synchronize information\
    \ amongst themselves.\n   LS's within different ITADs use TRIP to exchange gateway\
    \ information\n   according to policy. In the former case the LS's are referred\
    \ to as\n   internal peers, and in the latter case, external peers.\n   LS's communicate\
    \ with each other through persistent associations. An\n   LS may be connected\
    \ to one or more other LS's. LS's need not be\n   physically adjacent or part\
    \ of the same autonomous system. The\n   association between a pair of LS's is\
    \ normally set up\n   administratively. Two LS's are configured to communicate\
    \ with each\n   other when their administrators have an agreement in place to\n\
    \   exchange gateway information. While TRIP does not provide an\n   autodiscovery\
    \ procedure for peer LS's to discover each other, one\n   could possibly be used.\
    \ Such a procedure might be useful for finding\n   a backup peer LS when a crash\
    \ occurs. Alternatively, in an\n   environment where the business relationships\
    \ between peers become\n   more standardized, peers might be allowed to discover\
    \ each other\n   through protocols like the Service Location Protocol (SLP) [9].\n\

    \ is at the discretion of the administrator.\n   The syntax and semantics of the\
    \ messages exchanged over the\n   association between LS's are dictated by TRIP.\
    \  The protocol does not\n   dictate the nature of the agreements which must be\
    \ in place. TRIP\n   merely provides a transport means to exchange whatever gateway\n\
    \   routing information is deemed appropriate by the administrators of\n   the\
    \ system. Details are provided in the TRIP protocol specification\n   itself.\n\
    \   The rules which govern which gateway information is generated,\n   propagated,\

- title: 9.2.1 Nature of Exchanged Information
  contents:
  - "9.2.1 Nature of Exchanged Information\n   The information exchanged by the LS's\

    \ is known as a\n   route selection operation. The administrator has great latitude\
    \ in\n   selecting which objects to aggregate and propagate, so long as they\n\
    \   are within the bounds of correct protocol operation (i.e., no loops\n   are\
    \ formed). The selection can be made based on information learned\n   through\
    \ TRIP, or through any out of band means.\n   A routing object may have additional\
    \ information which characterizes\n   the service at the gateway. These attributes\
    \ include things like\n   protocols, features supported, and capacity. Greater\
    \ numbers of\n   attributes can provide useful information, however, they come\
    \ at a\n   cost. Aggregation becomes difficult with more and more information,\n\
    \   impacting the scalability of the protocol.\n   Aggregation plays a central\
    \ role in TRIP. In order to facilitate\n   scalability, routing objects can be\
    \ combined into larger aggregates\n   before being propagated. The mechanisms\
    \ by which this is done are\n   specified in TRIP. Aggregation of application\
    \ layer routes to\n   gateways is a non-trivial problem. There is a fundamental\
    \ tradeoff\n   between aggregatability and verbosity. The more information that\
    \ is\n   present in a TRIP routing object, the more difficult it is to\n   aggregate.\n\
    \   Consider a simple example of two gateways, A and B, capable of\n   reaching\
    \ some set of telephone numbers, X and Y, respectively. C is\n   an LS for the\
    \ ITAD in which A and B are resident. C learns of A and B\n   through some other\
    \ means. As it turns out, X and Y can be combined\n   into a single address range,\
    \ Z. C has several options. It can\n   propagate just the advertisement for A,\
    \ just the advertisement for B,\n   propagate both, or combine them and propagate\
    \ the aggregate\n   advertisement. In this case C chooses the latter approach,\
    \ and sends\n   a single routing object to one of its peers, D, containing address\n\
    \   range Z and its own address, since it is also a signaling server. D\n   is\
    \ also a signaling server.\n   Some calling device, E, wishes to place a phone\
    \ call to telephone\n   number T, which happens to be in the address range X.\
    \ E is configured\n   to use D as its default H.323 gatekeeper. So, E sends a\
    \ call setup\n   message to D, containing destination address T. D determines\
    \ that the\n   address T is within the range Z. As D had received a routing object\n\
    \   from C containing address range Z, it forwards the call setup message\n  \
    \ to C. C, in turn, sees that T is within range X, and so it forwards\n   the\
    \ call setup to A, which terminates the call signaling and\n   initiates a call\
    \ towards the telephone network.\n"
- title: 9.2.2 Quality of Service
  contents:
  - "9.2.2 Quality of Service\n   One of the factors which is useful to consider when\
    \ selecting a\n   gateway is \"QoS\" - will a call through this gateway suffer\n\
    \   sufficiently low loss, delay, and jitter? The quality of a call\n   depends\
    \ on two components - the QoS on the path between the caller\n   and gateway,\
    \ and the capacity of the gateway itself (measured in\n   terms of number of circuits\
    \ available, link capacity, DSP resources,\n   etc.). Determination of the latter\
    \ requires intricate knowledge of\n   underlying network topologies, and of where\
    \ the caller is located.\n   This is something handled by QoS routing protocols,\
    \ and is outside\n   the scope of TRIP.\n   However, gateway capacity is not dependent\
    \ on the caller location or\n   path characteristics. For this reason, a capacity\
    \ metric of some form\n   is supported by TRIP. This metric represents the static\
    \ capacity of\n   the gateway, not the dynamic available capacity which varies\n\
    \   continuously during the gateways operation. LS's can use this metric\n   as\
    \ a means of load balancing of calls among gateways. It can also be\n   used as\
    \ an input to any other policy decision.\n"
- title: 9.2.3 Cost Information
  contents:
  - "9.2.3 Cost Information\n   Another useful attribute to propagate is a pricing\
    \ metric. This might\n   represent the amount a particular gateway might charge\
    \ for a call.\n   The metric can be an index into a table that defines a pricing\n\
    \   structure according to a pre-existing business arrangement, or it can\n  \
    \ contain a representation of the price itself. TRIP itself does not\n   define\
    \ a pricing metric, but one can and should be defined as an\n   extension. Using\
    \ an extension for pricing means more than one such\n   metric can be defined.\n"
- title: 10 The Front End
  contents:
  - "10 The Front End\n   As a result of TRIP, the LS builds up a database (the TRIB)\
    \ of\n   gateway routes. This information is made available to various\n   entities\
    \ within the ITAD. The way in which this information is made\n   available is\
    \ called the front end. It is the visible means by which\n   TRIP services are\
    \ exposed outside of the protocol.\n"
- title: 10.1 Front End Customers
  contents:
  - "10.1 Front End Customers\n   There are several entities which might use the front\
    \ end to access\n   the TRIB. These include, but are not limited to:\n     Signaling\
    \ Servers: Signaling servers receive signaling messages\n        (such as H.323\
    \ or SIP messages) whose purpose is the initiation\n        of IP telephony calls.\
    \ The destination address of these calls\n        may be a phone number corresponding\
    \ to a terminal on the GSTN.\n        In order to route these calls to an appropriate\
    \ gateway, the\n        signaling server will need access to the database built\
    \ up in\n        the LS.\n     End Users: End users can directly query the LS\
    \ to get routing\n        information. This allows them to provide detailed information\
    \ on\n        their requirements. They can then go and contact the next hop\n\
    \        signaling server or gateway towards that phone number.\n     Administrators:\
    \ Administrators may need to access the TRIB for\n        maintenance and management\
    \ functions.\n   When a signaling server contacts the LS to route a phone number,\
    \ it\n   is usually doing so because a calling device (on behalf of an end\n \
    \  user) has attempted to set up a call. As a result, signaling servers\n   effectively\
    \ act as proxies for end users when accessing the LS\n   database. The communication\
    \ between the calling devices and their\n   proxies (the signaling servers) is\
    \ through the signaling protocol.\n   The advantage of this proxy approach is\
    \ that the actual LS\n   interaction is hidden from the calling device. Therefore,\
    \ whether the\n   call is to a phone number or IP address is irrelevant. The routing\
    \ in\n   the case of phone numbers takes place transparently. Proxy mode is\n\
    \   also advantageous for thin clients (such as standalone IP telephones)\n  \
    \ which do not have the interfaces or processing power for a direct\n   query\
    \ of the LS.\n   The disadvantage of the proxy approach is the same as its advantage\
    \ -\n   the LS interaction is hidden from the calling device (and thus the\n \
    \  end user). In some cases, the end user may have requirements as to\n   how\
    \ they would like the call to be routed. These include preferences\n   about cost,\
    \ quality, administrator, or call services and protocols.\n   These requirements\
    \ are called the end user policy. In the proxy\n   approach, the user effectively\
    \ accesses the service through the\n   signaling protocol. The signaling protocol\
    \ is not likely to be able\n   to support expression of complex call routing preferences\
    \ from end\n   users (note however, that SIP does support some forms of caller\n\
    \   preferences for call routing [10]). Therefore, direct access from the\n  \
    \ end user to the LS can provide much richer call routing services.\n   When the\
    \ end user policy is presented to the LS (either directly or\n   through the signaling\
    \ protocol), it is at the discretion of the LS\n   how to make use of it. The\
    \ location server may have its own policies\n   regarding how end user preferences\
    \ are handled.\n"
- title: 10.2 Front End Protocols
  contents:
  - "10.2 Front End Protocols\n   There are numerous protocols that can be used in\
    \ the front end to\n   access the LS database. TRIP does not specify or restrict\
    \ the\n   possibilities for the front end. It is not clear that it is necessary\n\
    \   or even desirable for there to be a single standard for the front\n   end.\
    \ The various protocols have their strengths and weaknesses. One\n   may be the\
    \ right solution in some cases, and another in different\n   cases.\n   Some of\
    \ the possible protocols for the front end are:\n     Service Location Protocol\
    \ (SLP): SLP has been designed to fit\n        exactly this kind of function.\
    \ SLP is ideal for locating servers\n        described by a set of attributes.\
    \ In this case, the server is a\n        gateway (or next hop towards the gateway),\
    \ and the attributes\n        are the end user policy. The end user is an SLP\
    \ UA, and the LS\n        is an SLP DA. The Service Query is used to ask for a\
    \ gateway\n        with a particular set of attributes.\n     Open Settlements\
    \ Protocol (OSP): OSP [11] is a client server\n        protocol. It allows the\
    \ client to query a server with a phone\n        number, and get back the address\
    \ of a next hop, along with\n        authorization tokens to use for the call.\
    \ In this case, the\n        server can be an LS. The routing table it uses to\
    \ respond to OSP\n        queries is the one built up using TRIP.\n     Lightweight\
    \ Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): LDAP is used for\n        accessing distributed\
    \ databases. Since the LS server contains a\n        database, LDAP could be used\
    \ to query it.\n     Web Page: The LS could have a web front end. Users could\
    \ enter\n        queries into a form, and the matching gateways returned in the\n\
    \        response. This access mechanism is more appropriate for human\n     \
    \   access, however. A signaling server would not likely access the\n        front\
    \ end through a web page.\n     TRIP: The protocols discussed above are all of\
    \ the query-response\n        type. There is no reason why the LS access must\
    \ be of this form.\n        It is perfectly acceptable for the access to be through\
    \ complete\n        database synchronization, so that the entity accessing the\
    \ LS\n        database effectively has a full copy of it. If this approach\n \
    \       were desired, TRIP itself is an appropriate mechanism. This\n        approach\
    \ has obvious drawbacks, but nothing precludes it from\n        being done.\n"
- title: 11 Number Translations
  contents:
  - "11 Number Translations\n   The model for TRIP is that of many gateways, each\
    \ of which is willing\n   to terminate calls towards some set of phone numbers.\
    \ Often, this set\n   will be based on the set of telephone numbers which are\
    \ in close\n   geographic proximity to the gateway. For example, a gateway in\
    \ New\n   York might be willing to terminate calls to the 212 and 718 area\n \
    \  codes. Of course, it is up to the administrator to decide on what\n   phone\
    \ numbers the gateway is willing to call.\n   However, certain phone numbers don't\
    \ represent GSTN terminals at all,\n   but rather they represent services or virtual\
    \ addresses. An example\n   of such numbers are freephone and LNP numbers. In\
    \ the telephone\n   network, these are actually mapped to routable telephone numbers,\n\
    \   often based on complex formulae. A classic example is time-of-day-\n   based\
    \ translation.\n   While nothing prevents a gateway from advertising reachability\
    \ to\n   these kinds of numbers, this usage is highly discouraged. Since TRIP\n\
    \   is a routing protocol, the routes it propagates should be to routable\n  \
    \ numbers, not to names which are eventually translated to routable\n   numbers.\
    \ Numerous problems arise when TRIP is used to propagate\n   routes to these numbers:\n\
    \      o Often, these numbers have only local significance. Calls to a\n     \
    \   freephone number made from New York might terminate in a New\n        York\
    \ office of a company, while calls made from California\n        will terminate\
    \ in a California branch. If this freephone\n        number is injected into TRIP\
    \ by a gateway in New York, it\n        could be propagated to other LS's with\
    \ end users in\n        California. If this route is used, calls may be not be\
    \ routed\n        as intended.\n      o The call signaling paths might be very\
    \ suboptimal. Consider a\n        gateway in New York that advertises a ported\
    \ number that maps\n        to a phone in California. This number is propagated\
    \ by TRIP,\n        eventually being learned by an LS with end users in\n    \
    \    California. When one of them dials this number, the call is\n        routed\
    \ over the IP network towards New York, where it hits the\n        gateway, and\
    \ then is routed over the GSTN back to California.\n        This is a waste of\
    \ resources. Had the ported number been\n        translated before the gateway\
    \ routing function was invoked, a\n        California gateway could have been\
    \ accessed directly.\n   As a result, it is more efficient to perform translations\
    \ of these\n   special numbers before the LS routing databases are accessed. How\n\
    \   this translation is done is outside the scope of TRIP. It can be\n   accomplished\
    \ by the calling device before making the call, or by a\n   signaling server before\
    \ it accesses the LS database.\n"
- title: 12 Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "12 Security Considerations\n   Security is an important component in TRIP. The\
    \ TRIP model assumes a\n   level of trust between peer LS's that exchange information.\
    \ This\n   information is used to propagate information which determines where\n\
    \   calls will be routed. If this information were incorrect, it could\n   cause\
    \ complete misrouting of calls. This enables a significant denial\n   of service\
    \ attack. The information might also be propagated to other\n   ITADs, causing\
    \ the problem to potentially spread. As a result, mutual\n   authentication of\
    \ peer LS's is critical. Furthermore, message\n   integrity is required.\n   TRIP\
    \ messages may contain potentially sensitive information. They\n   represent the\
    \ routing capabilities of an ITAD. Such information might\n   be used by corporate\
    \ competitors to determine the network topology\n   and capacity of the ITAD.\
    \ As a result, encryption of messages is also\n   supported in TRIP.\n   As routing\
    \ objects can be passed via one LS to another, there is a\n   need for some sort\
    \ of end to end authentication as well. However,\n   aggregation will cause the\
    \ routing objects to be modified, and\n   therefore authentication can only take\
    \ place from the point of last\n   aggregation to the receiving LS's.\n"
