- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Most routing protocols include three different types of\n\
    \   authentication schemes: Null authentication, cleartext password, and\n   cryptographic\
    \ authentication.  Null authentication is equivalent to\n   having no authentication\
    \ scheme at all.\n   In a cleartext scheme, also known as a \"simple password\"\
    \ scheme, the\n   password is exchanged completely unprotected, and anyone with\n\
    \   physical access to the network can learn the password and compromise\n   the\
    \ integrity of the routing domain.  The simple password scheme\n   protects against\
    \ accidental establishment of routing sessions in a\n   given domain, but beyond\
    \ that it offers no additional protection.\n   In a cryptographic authentication\
    \ scheme, routers share a secret key\n   that is used to generate a message authentication\
    \ code for each of\n   the protocol packets.  Today, routing protocols that implement\n\
    \   message authentication codes often use a Keyed-MD5 [RFC1321] digest.\n   The\
    \ recent escalating series of attacks on MD5 raise concerns about\n   its remaining\
    \ useful lifetime.\n   These attacks may not necessarily result in direct vulnerabilities\n\
    \   for Keyed-MD5 digests as message authentication codes because the\n   colliding\
    \ message may not correspond to a syntactically correct\n   protocol packet. \
    \ The known collision, pre-image, and second\n   pre-image attacks [RFC4270] on\
    \ MD5 may not increase the effectiveness\n   of the key recovery attacks on HMAC-MD5.\
    \  Regardless, there is a need\n   felt to deprecate MD5 [RFC1321] as the basis\
    \ for the Hashed Message\n   Authentication Code (HMAC) algorithm in favor of\
    \ stronger digest\n   algorithms.\n   In light of these considerations, there\
    \ are proposals to replace\n   HMAC-MD5 with keyed HMAC-SHA [SHS] digests where\
    \ HMAC-MD5 is\n   currently mandated in RIPv2 [RFC2453] IS-IS [ISO] [RFC1195],\
    \ and\n   Keyed-MD5 in OSPFv2 [RFC2328].\n   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] and RIPng [RFC2080]\
    \ rely on the IPv6 Authentication\n   Header (AH) [RFC4302] and IPv6 Encapsulating\
    \ Security Payload (ESP)\n   [RFC4303] in order to provide integrity, authentication,\
    \ and/or\n   confidentiality.\n   However, the nature of cryptography is that\
    \ algorithmic improvement\n   is an ongoing process, as is the exploration and\
    \ refinement of attack\n   vectors.  An algorithm believed to be strong today\
    \ may be\n   demonstrated to be weak tomorrow.  Given this, the choice of\n  \
    \ preferred algorithm should favor the minimization of the likelihood\n   of it\
    \ being compromised quickly.\n   It should be recognized that preferred algorithm(s)\
    \ will change over\n   time to adapt to the evolving threats.  At any particular\
    \ time, the\n   mandatory-to-implement algorithm(s) might not be specified in\
    \ the\n   base protocol specification.  As protocols are extended, the\n   preference\
    \ for presently stronger algorithms presents a problem\n   regarding the question\
    \ of interoperability of existing and future\n   implementations with respect\
    \ to standards, and also regarding\n   operational preference for the configuration\
    \ as deployed.\n   It is expected that an implementation should support the changing\
    \ of\n   security (authentication) keys.  Changing the symmetric key used in\n\
    \   any HMAC algorithm on a periodic basis is good security practice.\n   Operators\
    \ need to plan for this.\n   Implementations can support in-service key change\
    \ so that no control\n   packets are lost.  During an in-service/in-band key change,\
    \ more than\n   one key can be active for receiving packets for a session.  Some\n\
    \   protocols support a key identifier that allows the two peers of a\n   session\
    \ to have multiple keys simultaneously for a session.\n   However, these protocols\
    \ currently manage keys manually (i.e., via\n   operator intervention) or dynamically\
    \ based on some timer or security\n   protocol.\n"

    \ allows for authentication of its Protocol\n   Data Units (PDUs) via the authentication\
    \ TLV (TLV 10) in the PDU.\n   The base specification [ISO] had provisions only\
    \ for cleartext\n   passwords.  [RFC5304] extends the authentication capabilities\
    \ by\n   providing cryptographic authentication for IS-IS PDUs.  It mandates\n\
    \   support for HMAC-MD5.\n   [RFC5310] adds support for the use of any cryptographic\
    \ hash function\n   for authenticating IS-IS PDUs.  In addition to this, [RFC5310]\
    \ also\n   details how IS-IS can use the HMAC construct along with the Secure\n\

    \ IS-IS\n   implementations that use accepted authentication schemes.\n   The\
    \ earliest interoperability requirement for authentication as\n   stated by [ISO]\
    \ [RFC1195] required all implementations to support a\n   cleartext password.\
    \  This authentication scheme's utility is limited\n   to precluding the accidental\
    \ introduction of a new IS into a\n   broadcast domain.  Operators should not\
    \ use this scheme, as it\n   provides no protection against an attacker with access\
    \ to the\n   broadcast domain: anyone can determine the secret password through\n\
    \   inspection of the PDU.  This mechanism does not provide any\n   significant\
    \ level of security and should be avoided.\n   [RFC5304] defined the cryptographic\
    \ authentication scheme for IS-IS.\n   HMAC-MD5 was the only algorithm specified;\
    \ hence, it is mandated.\n   [RFC5310] defined a generic cryptographic scheme\
    \ and added support\n   for additional algorithms.  Implementations should support\

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The cryptographic mechanisms referenced in this\
    \ document provide only\n   authentication algorithms.  These algorithms do not\
    \ provide\n   confidentiality.  Encrypting the content of the packet and thereby\n\
    \   providing confidentiality is not considered in the definition of the\n   routing\
    \ protocols.\n   The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic\n\
    \   strength of the underlying hash function and on the size and quality\n   of\
    \ the key.  The feasibility of attacking the integrity of routing\n   protocol\
    \ messages protected by keyed digests may be significantly\n   more limited than\
    \ that of other data; however, preference for one\n   family of algorithms over\
    \ another may also change independently of\n   the perceived risk to a particular\
    \ protocol.\n   To ensure greater security, the keys used should be changed\n\
    \   periodically, and implementations must be able to store and use more\n   than\
    \ one key at the same time.  Operational experience suggests that\n   the lack\
    \ of periodic rekeying is a source of significant exposure and\n   that the lifespan\
    \ of shared keys in the network is frequently\n   measured in years.\n   While\
    \ simple password schemes are well represented in the document\n   series and\
    \ in conformant implementations of the protocols, the\n   inability to offer either\
    \ integrity or identity protection are\n   sufficient reason to strongly discourage\
    \ their use.\n   This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic\n\
    \   algorithms for use in the authentication of routing protocol packets\n   being\
    \ exchanged between adjacent routing processes.  The\n   cryptographic algorithms\
    \ identified in this document are not known to\n   be broken at the current time,\
    \ and ongoing cryptographic research so\n   far leads us to believe that they\
    \ will likely remain secure in the\n   foreseeable future.  We expect that new\
    \ revisions of this document\n   will be issued in the future to reflect current\
    \ thinking on the\n   algorithms that various routing protocols should employ\
    \ to ensure\n   interoperability between disparate implementations.\n"
