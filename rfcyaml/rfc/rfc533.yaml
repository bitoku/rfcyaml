  - "                           MESSAGE-ID NUMBERS\n    It has been noted that the\
    \ IMP message format (specified in BBN\nReport 1822) constrains network users\
    \ to low throughputs if messages are\nto be uniquely identified via the link number.\
    \  We have recently\nimplemented a change in the IMP/Host protocol which alleviates\
    \ this\ndifficulty.  The link field in the IMP/Host and Host/IMP leaders has\n\
    been extended to the right by four bits (in other words, it now uses\nbits 17\
    \ to 28 of the leader), and the name of the link field has been\nchanged to the\
    \ _message-id field_.  We expect this field to be used to\nuniquely identify messages\
    \ between the IMPs and the Hosts.  All 12 bits\nin the message-id will be returned\
    \ to the Host in RFNMs, INCOMPLETE\nTRANSMISSIONs, etc.  Note that no ordering\
    \ is implied by the use of the\nmessage-id field.\n    Given that the Host/Host\
    \ protocol uses the old link field to\nidentify connections, the additional four\
    \ bits in the new message-id\nfield might well be used to uniquely identify messages\
    \ on a given\nconnection (i.e., over a given link).  Of course, there is no obligation\n\
    for Hosts to uniquely identify their messages (the IMP subnetwork\ncertainly doesn't\
    \ care), so this change in the IMP/Host message format\nis completely backward\
    \ compatible.  In fact, since the receiving Host\ndoes not have to look at these\
    \ extra four bits on arriving messages, the\nchange is completely backward compatible\
    \ even when senders of messages\ndo use the extra four bits to uniquely identify\
    \ messages.\n    Please store this RFC with your copy of BBN Report 1822 until\
    \ 1822\nis updated.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for\
