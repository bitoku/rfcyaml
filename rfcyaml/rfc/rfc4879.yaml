  - "Abstract\n   This document clarifies and updates a single sentence in RFC 3979.\n\
    \   Specifically, when third party Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)\n   disclosures\
    \ are made, the intention is that the IETF Executive\n   Director notify the IPR\
    \ holder that a third party disclosure has been\n   filed, and to ask the IPR\
    \ holder whether they have any disclosure\n   that needs to be made, per applicable\
    \ RFC 3979 rules.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document clarifies and updates a single sentence in\
    \ RFC 3979\n   [RFC3979].  Specifically, when third party IPR disclosures are\
    \ made,\n   the intention is that the IETF Executive Director notify the IPR\n\
    \   holder that a third party disclosure has been filed, and to ask the\n   IPR\
    \ holder whether they have any disclosure that needs to be made,\n   per applicable\
    \ RFC 3979 rules.\n   This document updates RFC 3979.\n"
- title: 2.  The Fix
  contents:
  - "2.  The Fix\n   RFC 3979, Section 4 (C), states:\n    (C) Where Intellectual\
    \ Property Rights have been disclosed for IETF\n        Documents as provided\
    \ in Section 6 of this document, the IETF\n        Executive Director shall request\
    \ from the discloser of such IPR,\n        a written assurance that upon approval\
    \ by the IESG for\n        publication as RFCs of the relevant IETF specification(s),\
    \ all\n        persons will be able to obtain the right to implement, use,\n \
    \       distribute and exercise other rights with respect to\n        Implementing\
    \ Technology under one of the licensing options\n        specified in Section\
    \ 6.5 below unless such a statement has\n        already been submitted.\n   In\
    \ the case of third party disclosures, it makes no sense to ask the\n   discloser\
    \ about potential licensing terms, since they do not own the\n   IPR.  Instead,\
    \ it only makes sense to ask the IPR holder.\n   This document updates RFC 3979\
    \ by changing the word \"discloser\" to\n   \"holder\" in the above text.\n"
