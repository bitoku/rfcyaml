  - "Abstract\n   This document describes an architecture (464XLAT) for providing\n\
    \   limited IPv4 connectivity across an IPv6-only network by combining\n   existing\
    \ and well-known stateful protocol translation (as described\n   in RFC 6146)\
    \ in the core and stateless protocol translation (as\n   described in RFC 6145)\
    \ at the edge. 464XLAT is a simple and scalable\n   technique to quickly deploy\
    \ limited IPv4 access service to IPv6-only\n   edge networks without encapsulation.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   With the exhaustion of the unallocated IPv4 address pools,\
    \ it will be\n   difficult for many networks to assign IPv4 addresses to end users.\n\
    \   This document describes an IPv4-over-IPv6 solution as one of the\n   techniques\
    \ for IPv4 service extension and encouragement of IPv6\n   deployment. 464XLAT\
    \ is not a one-for-one replacement of full IPv4\n   functionality.  The 464XLAT\
    \ architecture only supports IPv4 in the\n   client-server model, where the server\
    \ has a global IPv4 address.\n   This means it is not fit for IPv4 peer-to-peer\
    \ communication or\n   inbound IPv4 connections. 464XLAT builds on IPv6 transport\
    \ and\n   includes full any-to-any IPv6 communication.\n   The 464XLAT architecture\
    \ described in this document uses IPv4/IPv6\n   translation standardized in [RFC6145]\
    \ and [RFC6146].  It does not\n   require DNS64 [RFC6147] since an IPv4 host may\
    \ simply send IPv4\n   packets, including packets to an IPv4 DNS server, that\
    \ will be\n   translated to IPv6 on the customer-side translator (CLAT) and back\
    \ to\n   IPv4 on the provider-side translator (PLAT).  464XLAT networks may\n\
    \   use DNS64 [RFC6147] to enable single stateful translation [RFC6146]\n   instead\
    \ of 464XLAT double translation where possible.  The 464XLAT\n   architecture\
    \ encourages the IPv6 transition by making IPv4 services\n   reachable across\
    \ IPv6-only networks and providing IPv6 and IPv4\n   connectivity to single-stack\
    \ IPv4 or IPv6 servers and peers.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   PLAT:   PLAT is provider-side translator (XLAT) that complies\
    \ with\n           [RFC6146].  It translates N:1 global IPv6 addresses to global\n\
    \           IPv4 addresses, and vice versa.\n   CLAT:   CLAT is customer-side\
    \ translator (XLAT) that complies with\n           [RFC6145].  It algorithmically\
    \ translates 1:1 private IPv4\n           addresses to global IPv6 addresses,\
    \ and vice versa.  The CLAT\n           function is applicable to a router or\
    \ an end-node such as a\n           mobile phone.  The CLAT should perform IP\
    \ routing and\n           forwarding to facilitate packets forwarding through\
    \ the\n           stateless translation even if it is an end-node.  The CLAT as\n\
    \           a common home router or wireless Third Generation Partnership\n  \
    \         Project (3GPP) router is expected to perform gateway\n           functions\
    \ such as being a DHCP server and DNS proxy for local\n           clients.  The\
    \ CLAT uses different IPv6 prefixes for CLAT-side\n           and PLAT-side IPv4\
    \ addresses and therefore does not comply\n           with the sentence \"Both\
    \ IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses and\n           IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses\
    \ SHOULD use the same prefix.\" in\n           Section 3.3 of [RFC6052].  The\
    \ CLAT does not facilitate\n           communications between a local IPv4-only\
    \ node and an IPv6-\n           only node on the Internet.\n"
- title: 3.  Motivation and Uniqueness of 464XLAT
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivation and Uniqueness of 464XLAT\n   The list below describes the motivation\
    \ for 464XLAT and its unique\n   characteristics.\n   o  464XLAT has minimal IPv4\
    \ resource requirements and maximum IPv4\n      efficiency through statistical\
    \ multiplexing.\n   o  No new protocols are required; there is quick deployment.\n\
    \   o  IPv6-only networks are simpler and therefore less expensive to\n      operate\
    \ than dual-stack networks.\n   o  464XLAT has consistent native IP-based monitoring\
    \ and traffic\n      engineering.  Capacity-planning techniques can be applied\
    \ without\n      the indirection or obfuscation of a tunnel.\n"

    \ of the type of access service\n   -- for example, fiber to the home (FTTH),\
    \ Data Over Cable Service\n   Interface Specification (DOCSIS), or WiFi.\n   Wireless\

    \ ISP is only required to\n   deploy an IPv6 access network.  All ISPs do not\

    \ and\n   highly scalable IPv6-only environment.\n"

  - "5.2.  Wireless 3GPP Network Applicability\n   At the time of writing, in April\
    \ 2013, the vast majority of mobile\n   networks are compliant to Pre-Release\
    \ 9 3GPP standards.  In Pre-\n   Release 9 3GPP networks, Global System for Mobile\
    \ Communications\n   (GSM) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)\
    \ networks\n   must signal and support both IPv4 and IPv6 Packet Data Protocol\
    \ (PDP)\n   attachments to access IPv4 and IPv6 network destinations [RFC6459].\n\
    \   Since there are two PDPs required to support two address families,\n   this\
    \ is double the number of PDPs required to support the status quo\n   of one address\
    \ family, which is IPv4.\n   For the cases of connecting to an IPv4 literal or\
    \ IPv4 socket that\n   require IPv4 connectivity, the CLAT function on the UE\
    \ provides a\n   private IPv4 address and IPv4 default route on the host for the\n\
    \   applications to reference and bind to.  Connections sourced from the\n   IPv4\
    \ interface are immediately routed to the CLAT function and passed\n   to the\
    \ IPv6-only mobile network, destined for the PLAT.  In summary,\n   the UE performs\
    \ the CLAT function that does a stateless translation\n   [RFC6145], but only\
    \ when required by an IPv4-only scenario such as\n   IPv4 literals or IPv4-only\
    \ sockets.  The mobile network has a PLAT\n   that does stateful translation [RFC6146].\n\
    \   464XLAT works with today's existing systems as much as possible.\n   464XLAT\
    \ is compatible with existing solutions for network-based deep\n   packet inspection\
    \ like 3GPP standardized Policy and Charging Control\n   (PCC) [TS.23203].\n"

- title: 6.3.  IPv6 Prefix Handling
  contents:
  - "6.3.  IPv6 Prefix Handling\n   There are two relevant IPv6 prefixes that the\
    \ CLAT must be aware of.\n   First, CLAT must know its own IPv6 prefixes.  The\
    \ CLAT should acquire\n   a /64 for the uplink interface, a /64 for all downlink\
    \ interfaces,\n   and a dedicated /64 prefix for the purpose of sending and receiving\n\
    \   statelessly translated packets.  When a dedicated /64 prefix is not\n   available\
    \ for translation from DHCPv6-PD [RFC3633], the CLAT may\n   perform NAT44 for\
    \ all IPv4 LAN packets so that all the LAN-originated\n   IPv4 packets appear\
    \ from a single IPv4 address and are then\n   statelessly translated to one interface\
    \ IPv6 address that is claimed\n   by the CLAT via the Neighbor Discovery Protocol\
    \ (NDP) and defended\n   with Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).\n   Second, the\
    \ CLAT must discover the PLAT-side translation IPv6 prefix\n   used as a destination\
    \ of the PLAT.  The CLAT will use this prefix as\n   the destination of all translation\
    \ packets that require stateful\n   translation to the IPv4 Internet.  It may\
    \ discover the PLAT-side\n   translation prefix using [Discovery-Heuristic]. \
    \ In the future, some\n   other mechanisms, such as a new DHCPv6 option, will\
    \ possibly be\n   defined to communicate the PLAT-side translation prefix.\n"
- title: 6.4.  DNS Proxy Implementation
  contents:
  - "6.4.  DNS Proxy Implementation\n   The CLAT should implement a DNS proxy as defined\
    \ in [RFC5625].  The\n   case of an IPv4-only node behind the CLAT querying an\
    \ IPv4 DNS server\n   is undesirable since it requires both stateful and stateless\n\
    \   translation for each DNS lookup.  The CLAT should set itself as the\n   DNS\
    \ server via DHCP or other means and should proxy DNS queries for\n   IPv4 and\
    \ IPv6 LAN clients.  Using the CLAT-enabled home router or UE\n   as a DNS proxy\
    \ is a normal consumer gateway function and simplifies\n   the traffic flow so\
    \ that only IPv6 native queries are made across the\n   access network.  DNS queries\
    \ from the client that are not sent to the\n   DNS proxy on the CLAT must be allowed\
    \ and are translated and\n   forwarded just like any other IP traffic.\n"
- title: 6.5.  CLAT in a Gateway
  contents:
  - "6.5.  CLAT in a Gateway\n   The CLAT feature can be implemented in a common home\
    \ router or mobile\n   phone that has a tethering feature.  Routers with a CLAT\
    \ feature\n   should also provide common router services such as DHCP of [RFC1918]\n\
    \   addresses, DHCPv6, NDP with Router Advertisement, and DNS service.\n"

  - "6.6.  CLAT-to-CLAT Communications\n   464XLAT is a hub and spoke architecture\
    \ focused on enabling IPv4-only\n   services over IPv6-only networks.  Interactive\
    \ Connectivity\n   Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] may be used to support peer-to-peer\n\
    \   communication within a 464XLAT network.\n"

- title: 7.1.  Traffic Engineering
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Traffic Engineering\n   Even if the ISP for end users is different from\
    \ the PLAT provider\n   (e.g., another ISP), it can implement traffic engineering\n\
    \   independently from the PLAT provider.  Detailed reasons are below:\n   1.\
    \  The ISP for end users can figure out the IPv4 destination address\n       from\
    \ the translated IPv6 packet header, so it can implement\n       traffic engineering\
    \ based on the IPv4 destination address (e.g.,\n       traffic monitoring for\
    \ each IPv4 destination address, packet\n       filtering for each IPv4 destination\
    \ address, etc.).  The\n       tunneling methods do not have such an advantage,\
    \ without any deep\n       packet inspection for processing the inner IPv4 packet\
    \ of the\n       tunnel packet.\n   2.  If the ISP for end users can assign an\
    \ IPv6 prefix greater than\n       /64 to each subscriber, this 464XLAT architecture\
    \ can separate\n       the IPv6 prefix for native IPv6 packets and the XLAT prefixes\
    \ for\n       IPv4/IPv6 translation packets.  Accordingly, it can identify the\n\
    \       type of packets (\"native IPv6 packets\" and \"IPv4/IPv6 translation\n\
    \       packets\") and implement traffic engineering based on the IPv6\n     \
    \  prefix.\n"
