Abstract This document concludes the For Your Information (FYI)
sub series of RFCs, established by RFC 1150 for use by the IETF User Services Area, which no longer exists.
The IESG does not intend to make any further additions to this RFC sub series, and this document provides a record of this decision.
This document also obsoletes RFC 1150 and changes the status of RFC 1150 to Historic.
sub series of RFCs was established by RFC 1150
[RFC1150] in 1990 for use by the IETF User Services Area, which has not met since IETF 53 held in March 2001.
This RFC sub  series was designed to provide Internet users with a repository of information regarding the Internet that might be interesting to a wide range of people.
The publication of RFC 1150
[RFC1150] introduced the FYI sub series of RFCs.
Since that time, a total of 38 FYI numbers have been assigned.
Many other Informational RFCs have been published that are not part of the FYI sub series.
The list of documents in the FYI sub series can be found on the RFC Editor web site [INDEX].
Conclusion of the FYI Sub Series
The IESG does not intend to make any further additions to the FYI sub series.
The IESG intends to continue to produce Informational RFCs, but none of them will be assigned an FYI number.
All published RFCs that are currently part of the FYI sub series will retain their FYI numbers.
The FYI numbers continue to provide reference points for these documents, and the FYI number can be used in citations to these documents.
If a future RFC is published that obsoletes an existing member of the FYI sub series, the new RFC will not be assigned an FYI number.
RFC 1150 Moved to Historic
This document moves RFC 1150
The procedural information in RFC 1150 is no longer valid.
If it becomes desirable to make additions to the FYI sub series in the future, new procedures can be developed to replace this document.
No Internet security issues are anticipated by the actions described in this document.
