Abstract This document is an addendum to RFC 4348, which specifies the RTP payload format for the Variable Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR WB) speech codec.
This document specifies some updates in RFC 4348 to enable support for the new operating mode of VMR WB standard (i.e., VMR WB mode 4).
These updates do not affect the existing modes of VMR WB already specified in RFC 4348.
The payload formats and their associated parameters, as well as all provisions, restrictions, use cases, features, etc., that are specified in RFC 4348 are applicable to the new operating mode with no exception.
This document is an addendum to RFC 4348 [2] and contains the necessary updates for the support of the new operating mode of 3GPP2 VMR WB standard [1].
The new mode of VMR WB standard (VMR WB mode 4), although operating at a lower data rate, has similar characteristics and functionalities compared to the existing modes of VMR WB already included in RFC 4348 (e.g., variable bit rate, narrowband/wideband input/output speech/audio processing capability, continuous and discontinuous transmission, etc.).
Therefore, all provisions and restrictions specified in RFC 4348 are applicable to all modes of the VMR WB standard including the new mode, which is specified in this document.
As a result, no new media type registration is required.
The VMR WB file format for transport of VMR WB speech data in storage mode applications is specified in [1,4] and includes support for the new mode of operation.
The following sections provide the necessary updates to RFC 4348 to enable support of VMR WB mode 4.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

The Variable Rate Multimode Wideband
VMR WB is the wideband speech coding standard developed by the Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) for encoding/decoding wideband/narrowband speech content in multimedia services in 3G CDMA cellular systems [1].
VMR WB is a source controlled variable rate multimode wideband speech codec.
It has a number of operating modes, where each mode is a trade off between voice quality and average data rate.
The operating mode in VMR WB (as shown in Table 2) is chosen based on the traffic condition of the network and the desired quality of service.
The desired average data rate (ADR) in each mode is obtained by encoding speech frames at permissible rates (as shown in Tables 1 and 3) compliant with CDMA2000 system depending on the instantaneous characteristics of input speech and the maximum and minimum rate constraints imposed by the network operator.
The capabilities of the VMR WB codec were extended through the addition of a new mode operating at lower average data rates, resulting in improved system capacity in IP and non IP networks [1].
As a result of this extension, certain reserved table entries in RFC 4348 are used to include support for the new operating mode.
VMR WB mode 4 is compliant with all applicable provisions and restrictions specified in RFC 4348 [2].
Note that the existing table entries of RFC 4348 remain unchanged (e.g., frame types) and the original modes of VMR WB are not affected by these updates.
The existing flexibility in RFC 4348 for future extensions allows the addition of the new mode without any impact on the interoperability with earlier implementations of RFC 4348.
The following sections provide the necessary updates that are required to be made in RFC 4348.
The provisions and considerations for implementation, congestion control, and security remain identical to those specified in RFC 4348.
The Necessary Updates in RFC 4348 Table 1 of RFC 4348 is updated as follows:
Full Rate with Bit Errors
Table 2 of RFC 4348 is updated as follows to include VMR WB mode 4 and VMR WB mode 4 with maximum half rate similar to that described in Section 2.4 of the revised VMR WB specification [1].
VMR WB mode 4 with maximum half rate
No Preference (no mode request is present)
List of valid CMR values and their associated VMR WB operating modes Note that CMR values 7 and 8 replace the reserved values in Table 2 of RFC 4348.
Table 3 of RFC 4348 is updated as follows to include new frame types (FTs) associated with VMR WB mode 4.
Note that the sizes of the frames are unique and different, allowing for the use of header free payload format for all modes of operations [2].
Interoperable Full Rate (AMR WB 6.60 kbps)
1    Interoperable Full Rate (AMR WB 8.85 kbps)
2    Interoperable Full Rate (AMR WB 12.65 kbps)
Erasure (AMR WB SPEECH LOST)
Blank (AMR WB NO DATA)
VMR WB payload frame types for real time transport Note that the new FT types associated with VMR WB mode 4 replace the reserved entries 7, 8, and 10 in Table 3 of RFC 4348
and there are no changes in the existing entries of Table 3 of RFC 4348.
The 'mode set' MIME parameter value 4 is defined to indicate that VMR WB mode 4 is supported and used.
Note that the active modes of operation are negotiated and agreed by the IP terminals through the offer/answer model provided in Section 9.3 of RFC 4348 [2].
Security Considerations Same as RFC 4348.
The VMR WB speech codec including the new mode is specified in following 3GPP2 specification C.S0052
Transfer methods are specified in RFC 4348.
This document updates the media type registered in [2].
IANA has added this document as reference to that media type registration and has modified the optional parameter mode set in the registration.
Section 9.1 of RFC 4348
Currently, this list includes modes 0, 1, 2, and 3 [1], but MAY be extended in the future.
If such mode set is specified during session initiation, the encoder MUST NOT use modes outside of the subset.
If not present, all operating modes in the set 0 to 3 are allowed for the session.
IANA will change "modes 0, 1, 2 and 3 [1]" to "modes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 [1] [2]", and change "modes in the set 0 to 3" to "modes in the set 0 to 4".
[1] will be the IANA's reference to the original VMR WB document (3GPP2 C.S0052
[2] will be IANA's reference to this document (RFC 4424).
