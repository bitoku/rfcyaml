  - "Abstract\n   The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file\n
    \  transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a\n   remote
    host.\n   This document describes two TFTP options. The first allows the client\n
    \  and server to negotiate the Timeout Interval.  The second allows the\n   side
    receiving the file to determine the ultimate size of the\n   transfer before it
    begins.  The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is\n   described in [2].\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "Timeout Interval Option Specification\n   The TFTP Read Request or Write Request
    packet is modified to include\n   the timeout option as follows:\n      |  opc
    \ |filename| 0 |  mode  | 0 | timeout| 0 |  #secs | 0 |\n      opc\n         The
    opcode field contains either a 1, for Read Requests, or 2,\n         for Write
    Requests, as defined in [1].\n      filename\n         The name of the file to
    be read or written, as defined in [1].\n         This is a NULL-terminated field.\n
    \     mode\n         The mode of the file transfer: \"netascii\", \"octet\", or
    \"mail\",\n         as defined in [1].  This is a NULL-terminated field.\n      timeout\n
    \        The Timeout Interval option, \"timeout\" (case in-sensitive).\n         This
    is a NULL-terminated field.\n      #secs\n         The number of seconds to wait
    before retransmitting, specified\n         in ASCII.  Valid values range between
    \"1\" and \"255\" seconds,\n         inclusive.  This is a NULL-terminated field.\n
    \  For example:\n      +-------+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+-------+---+\n
    \     |   1   | foobar | 0 | octet  | 0 | timeout| 0 |   1   | 0 |\n      +-------+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+-------+---+\n
    \  is a Read Request, for the file named \"foobar\", in octet (binary)\n   transfer
    mode, with a timeout interval of 1 second.\n   If the server is willing to accept
    the timeout option, it sends an\n   Option Acknowledgment (OACK) to the client.
    \ The specified timeout\n   value must match the value specified by the client.\n"

  - "Transfer Size Option Specification\n   The TFTP Read Request or Write Request
    packet is modified to include\n   the tsize option as follows:\n      +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+\n
    \     |  opc  |filename| 0 |  mode  | 0 | tsize  | 0 |  size  | 0 |\n      +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+\n
    \     opc\n         The opcode field contains either a 1, for Read Requests, or
    2,\n         for Write Requests, as defined in [1].\n      filename\n         The
    name of the file to be read or written, as defined in [1].\n         This is a
    NULL-terminated field.\n      mode\n         The mode of the file transfer: \"netascii\",
    \"octet\", or \"mail\",\n         as defined in [1].  This is a NULL-terminated
    field.\n      tsize\n         The Transfer Size option, \"tsize\" (case in-sensitive).
    \ This is\n         a NULL-terminated field.\n      size\n         The size of
    the file to be transfered.  This is a NULL-\n         terminated field.\n   For
    example:\n      +-------+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+\n
    \     |   2   | foobar | 0 | octet  | 0 | tsize  | 0 | 673312 | 0 |\n      +-------+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+\n
    \  is a Write Request, with the 673312-octet file named \"foobar\", in\n   octet
    (binary) transfer mode.\n   In Read Request packets, a size of \"0\" is specified
    in the request\n   and the size of the file, in octets, is returned in the OACK.
    \ If the\n   file is too large for the client to handle, it may abort the transfer\n
    \  with an Error packet (error code 3).  In Write Request packets, the\n   size
    of the file, in octets, is specified in the request and echoed\n   back in the
    OACK.  If the file is too large for the server to handle,\n   it may abort the
    transfer with an Error packet (error code 3).\n"

  - "Security Considerations\n   The basic TFTP protocol has no security mechanism.
    \ This is why it\n   has no rename, delete, or file overwrite capabilities.  This
    document\n   does not add any security to TFTP; however, the specified extensions\n
    \  do not add any additional security risks.\n"
