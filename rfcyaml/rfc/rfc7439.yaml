    \   protocol suite in the context of IPv6 and identifies gaps that must\n   be\
    \ addressed in order to allow MPLS-related protocols and\n   applications to be\
    \ used with IPv6-only networks.  This document is\n   intended to focus on gaps\
    \ in the standards defining the MPLS suite,\n   and is not intended to highlight\
    \ particular vendor implementations\n   (or lack thereof) in the context of IPv6-only\
    \ MPLS functionality.\n   In the data plane, MPLS fully supports IPv6, and MPLS\
    \ labeled packets\n   can be carried over IPv6 packets in a variety of encapsulations.\n\
    \   However, support for IPv6 among MPLS control-plane protocols, MPLS\n   applications,\
    \ MPLS Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM),\n   and MIB modules\
    \ is mixed, with some protocols having major gaps.  For\n   most major gaps, work\
    \ is in progress to upgrade the relevant\n   protocols.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   IPv6 [RFC2460] is an integral part of modern network deployments.\
    \  At\n   the time when this document was written, the majority of these IPv6\n\
    \   deployments were using dual-stack implementations, where IPv4 and\n   IPv6\
    \ are supported equally on many or all of the network nodes, and\n   single-stack\
    \ primarily referred to IPv4-only devices.  Dual-stack\n   deployments provide\
    \ a useful margin for protocols and features that\n   are not currently capable\
    \ of operating solely over IPv6, because they\n   can continue using IPv4 as necessary.\
    \  However, as IPv6 deployment\n   and usage becomes more pervasive, and IPv4\
    \ exhaustion begins driving\n   changes in address consumption behaviors, there\
    \ is an increasing\n   likelihood that many networks will need to start operating\
    \ some or\n   all of their network nodes either as primarily IPv6 (most functions\n\
    \   use IPv6, a few legacy features use IPv4), or as IPv6-only (no IPv4\n   provisioned\
    \ on the device).  This transition toward IPv6-only\n   operation exposes any\
    \ gaps where features, protocols, or\n   implementations are still reliant on\
    \ IPv4 for proper function.  To\n   that end, and in the spirit of the recommendation\
    \ in RFC 6540\n   [RFC6540] that implementations need to stop requiring IPv4 for\
    \ proper\n   and complete function, this document reviews the MPLS protocol suite\n\
    \   in the context of IPv6 and identifies gaps that must be addressed in\n   order\
    \ to allow MPLS-related protocols and applications to be used\n   with IPv6-only\
    \ networks and networks that are primarily IPv6\n   (hereafter referred to as\
    \ IPv6-primary).  This document is intended\n   to focus on gaps in the standards\
    \ defining the MPLS suite, and not to\n   highlight particular vendor implementations\
    \ (or lack thereof) in the\n   context of IPv6-only MPLS functionality.\n"
- title: 2.  Use Case
  contents:
  - "2.  Use Case\n   This section discusses some drivers for ensuring that MPLS completely\n\
    \   supports IPv6-only operation.  It is not intended to be a\n   comprehensive\
    \ discussion of all potential use cases, but rather a\n   discussion of one use\
    \ case to provide context and justification to\n   undertake such a gap analysis.\n\
    \   IP convergence is continuing to drive new classes of devices to begin\n  \
    \ communicating via IP.  Examples of such devices could include set-top\n   boxes\
    \ for IP video distribution, cell tower electronics (macro or\n   micro cells),\
    \ infrastructure Wi-Fi access points, and devices for\n   machine-to-machine (M2M)\
    \ or Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\n   In some cases, these classes of\
    \ devices represent a very large\n   deployment base, on the order of thousands\
    \ or even millions of\n   devices network-wide.  The scale of these networks,\
    \ coupled with the\n   increasingly overlapping use of RFC 1918 [RFC1918] address\
    \ space\n   within the average network and the lack of globally routable IPv4\n\
    \   space available for long-term growth, begins to drive the need for\n   many\
    \ of the endpoints in this network to be managed solely via IPv6.\n   Even if\
    \ these devices are carrying some IPv4 user data, it is often\n   encapsulated\
    \ in another protocol such that the communication between\n   the endpoint and\
    \ its upstream devices can be IPv6-only without\n   impacting support for IPv4\
    \ on user data.  As the number of devices to\n   manage increases, the operator\
    \ is compelled to move to IPv6.\n   Depending on the MPLS features required, it\
    \ is plausible to assume\n   that the (existing) MPLS network will need to be\
    \ extended to these\n   IPv6-only devices.\n   Additionally, as the impact of\
    \ IPv4 exhaustion becomes more acute,\n   more and more aggressive IPv4 address\
    \ reclamation measures will be\n   justified.  Many networks are likely to focus\
    \ on preserving their\n   remaining IPv4 addresses for revenue-generating customers\
    \ so that\n   legacy support for IPv4 can be maintained as long as necessary.\
    \  As a\n   result, it may be appropriate for some or all of the network\n   infrastructure,\
    \ including MPLS Label Switching Routers (LSRs) and\n   Label Edge Routers (LERs),\
    \ to have its IPv4 addresses reclaimed and\n   transition toward IPv6-only operation.\n"
- title: 3.  Gap Analysis
  contents:
  - "3.  Gap Analysis\n   This gap analysis aims to answer the question of what fails\
    \ when one\n   attempts to use MPLS features on a network of IPv6-only devices.\
    \  The\n   baseline assumption for this analysis is that some endpoints, as well\n\
    \   as Label Switching Routers (Provider Edge (PE) and Provider (P)\n   routers),\
    \ only have IPv6 transport available and need to support the\n   full suite of\
    \ MPLS features defined as of the time of this document's\n   writing at parity\
    \ with the support on an IPv4 network.  This is\n   necessary whether they are\
    \ enabled via the Label Distribution\n   Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036], RSVP - Traffic\
    \ Engineering (RSVP-TE)\n   [RFC3209], or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC3107],\
    \ and whether\n   they are encapsulated in MPLS [RFC3032], IP [RFC4023], Generic\n\
    \   Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC4023], or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol\n   Version\
    \ 3 (L2TPv3) [RFC4817].  It is important when evaluating these\n   gaps to distinguish\
    \ between user data and control-plane data, because\n   while this document is\
    \ focused on IPv6-only operation, it is quite\n   likely that some amount of the\
    \ user payload data being carried in the\n   IPv6-only MPLS network will still\
    \ be IPv4.\n   A note about terminology: Gaps identified by this document are\n\
    \   characterized as \"Major\" or \"Minor\".  Major gaps refer to significant\n\
    \   changes necessary in one or more standards to address the gap due to\n   existing\
    \ standards language having either missing functionality for\n   IPv6-only operation\
    \ or explicit language requiring the use of IPv4\n   with no IPv6 alternatives\
    \ defined.  Minor gaps refer to changes\n   necessary primarily to clarify existing\
    \ standards language.  Usually\n   these changes are needed in order to explicitly\
    \ codify IPv6 support\n   in places where it is either implicit or omitted today,\
    \ but the\n   omission is unlikely to prevent IPv6-only operation.\n"
- title: 3.1.  MPLS Data Plane
  contents:
  - "3.1.  MPLS Data Plane\n   MPLS labeled packets can be transmitted over a variety\
    \ of data links\n   [RFC3032], and MPLS labeled packets can also be encapsulated\
    \ over IP.\n   The encapsulations of MPLS in IP and GRE, as well as MPLS over\n\
    \   L2TPv3, support IPv6.  See Section 3 of RFC 4023 [RFC4023] and\n   Section\

- title: 3.2.1.  Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)\n   The Label Distribution Protocol\
    \ (LDP) [RFC5036] defines a set of\n   procedures for distribution of labels between\
    \ Label Switching Routers\n   that can use the labels for forwarding traffic.\
    \  While LDP was\n   designed to use an IPv4 or dual-stack IP network, it has\
    \ a number of\n   deficiencies that prevent it from working in an IPv6-only network.\n\
    \   LDP-IPv6 [LDP-IPv6] highlights some of the deficiencies when LDP is\n   enabled\
    \ in IPv6-only or dual-stack networks and specifies appropriate\n   protocol changes.\
    \  These deficiencies are related to Label Switched\n   Path (LSP) mapping, LDP\
    \ identifiers, LDP discovery, LDP session\n   establishment, next-hop address,\
    \ and LDP Time To Live (TTL) security\n   [RFC5082] [RFC6720].\n   Gap: Major;\
    \ update to RFC 5036 in progress via [LDP-IPv6], which\n   should close this gap.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Multipoint LDP (mLDP)
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Multipoint LDP (mLDP)\n   Multipoint LDP (mLDP) is a set of extensions\
    \ to LDP for setting up\n   Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint\
    \ (MP2MP) LSPs.\n   These extensions are specified in RFC 6388 [RFC6388].  In\
    \ terms of\n   IPv6-only gap analysis, mLDP has two identified areas of interest:\n\
    \   1.  LDP Control Plane: Since mLDP uses the LDP control plane to\n       discover\
    \ and establish sessions with the peer, it shares the same\n       gaps as LDP\
    \ (Section 3.2.1) with regards to control plane\n       (discovery, transport,\
    \ and session establishment) in an IPv6-only\n       network.\n   2.  Multipoint\
    \ (MP) Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) Root Address:\n       mLDP defines its\
    \ own MP FECs and rules, different from LDP, to\n       map MP LSPs.  An mLDP\
    \ MP FEC contains a Root Address field that\n       is an IP address in IP networks.\
    \  The current specification\n       allows specifying the root address according\
    \ to the Address\n       Family Identifier (AFI), and hence covers both IPv4 or\
    \ IPv6 root\n       addresses, requiring no extension to support IPv6-only MP\
    \ LSPs.\n       The root address is used by each LSR participating in an MP LSP\n\
    \       setup such that root address reachability is resolved by doing a\n   \
    \    table lookup against the root address to find corresponding\n       upstream\
    \ neighbor(s).  This will pose a problem if an MP LSP\n       traverses IPv4-only\
    \ and IPv6-only nodes in a dual-stack network\n       on the way to the root node.\n\
    \   For example, consider following setup, where R1/R6 are IPv4-only, R3/\n  \
    \ R4 are IPv6-only, and R2/R5 are dual-stack LSRs:\n   ( IPv4-only )  (  IPv6-only\
    \   )  ( IPv4-only )\n          R1 -- R2 -- R3 -- R4 -- R5 -- R6\n          Leaf\
    \                          Root\n   Assume R1 to be a leaf node for a P2MP LSP\
    \ rooted at R6 (root node).\n   R1 uses R6's IPv4 address as the root address\
    \ in MP FEC.  As the MP\n   LSP signaling proceeds from R1 to R6, the MP LSP setup\
    \ will fail on\n   the first IPv6-only transit/branch LSRs (R3) when trying to\
    \ find IPv4\n   root address reachability.  RFC 6512 [RFC6512] defines a recursive-\n\
    \   FEC solution and procedures for mLDP when the backbone (transit/\n   branch)\
    \ LSRs have no route to the root.  The proposed solution is\n   defined for a\
    \ BGP-free core in a VPN environment, but a similar\n   concept can be used/extended\
    \ to solve the above issue of the\n   IPv6-only backbone receiving an MP FEC element\
    \ with an IPv4 address.\n   The solution will require a border LSR (the one that\
    \ is sitting on\n   the border of an IPv4/IPv6 island (namely, R2 and R5 in this\n\
    \   example)) to translate an IPv4 root address to an equivalent IPv6\n   address\
    \ (and vice versa) through procedures similar to RFC 6512.\n   Gap: Major; update\
    \ in progress for LDP via [LDP-IPv6], may need\n   additional updates to RFC 6512.\n"

    \ [RFC4762] specify the LDP\n   protocol changes to instantiate VPWS and VPLS\
    \ services, respectively,\n   in an MPLS network using LDP as the signaling protocol.\
    \  This is\n   complemented by RFC 6074 [RFC6074], which specifies a set of\n\
    \   procedures for instantiating L2VPNs (e.g., VPWS, VPLS) using BGP as a\n  \
    \ discovery protocol and LDP, as well as L2TPv3, as a signaling\n   protocol.\
    \  RFC 4761 [RFC4761] and RFC 6624 [RFC6624] specify BGP\n   protocol changes\
    \ to instantiate VPLS and VPWS services in an MPLS\n   network, using BGP for\

    \ packets are UDP packets over either IPv4 or IPv6 (see\n   Section 4.3 of RFC\

    \ IPv6 address from the range\n   0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:127/104; that is, using an IPv4-mapped\
    \ IPv6 address.\n   This is a transitional mechanism that should not bleed into\
    \ IPv6-only\n   networks, as [IPv4-MAPPED] explains.  The issue is that the MPLS\

    \   destination addresses to exercise Equal Cost Multiple Path (ECMP),\n   but\
    \ the IPv6 address architecture specifies a single address\n   (::1/128) for loopback.\

    \ value for IPv6 RAO.  This gap\n   needs to be fixed to be able to use LSP Ping\
    \ in IPv6 networks.\n   Further details on this gap are captured, along with a\
    \ proposed\n   solution, in [IPv6-RAO].\n   Another gap is that the mechanisms\

    \ the LSP interior router is not IPv4-aware.\n   It cannot parse the IPv4 Echo\
    \ Request, nor can it send an IPv4 Echo\n   Reply.  So, no reply is sent.\n  \
    \ The mechanism described in RFC 4379 also does not sufficiently\n   explain the\

  - "4.  Gap Summary\n   This document has reviewed a wide variety of MPLS features\
    \ and\n   protocols to determine their suitability for use on IPv6-only or\n \
    \  IPv6-primary networks.  While some parts of the MPLS suite will\n   function\
    \ properly without additional changes, gaps have been\n   identified in others\
    \ that will need to be addressed with follow-on\n   work.  This section will summarize\
    \ those gaps, along with pointers to\n   any work in progress to address them.\
    \  Note that because the\n   referenced documents are works in progress and do\
    \ not have consensus\n   at the time of this document's publication, there could\
    \ be other\n   solutions proposed at a future time, and the pointers in this\n\
    \   document should not be considered normative in any way.\n   Additionally,\
    \ work in progress on new features that use MPLS\n   protocols will need to ensure\
    \ that those protocols support operation\n   on IPv6-only or IPv6-primary networks,\
    \ or explicitly identify any\n   dependencies on existing gaps that, once resolved,\
    \ will allow proper\n   IPv6-only operation.\n              Identified Gaps in\
