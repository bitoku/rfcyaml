  - "1.  Introduction\n   BGP communities [RFC1997] are used by service providers\
    \ for many\n   purposes, including tagging of customer, peer, and geographically\n\
    \   originated routes.  Such tagging is typically used to control the\n   scope\
    \ of redistribution of routes within a provider's network and to\n   its customers\
    \ and peers.  Communities are also used for a wide\n   variety of other applications,\
    \ such as allowing customers to set\n   attributes such as LOCAL_PREF [RFC1771]\
    \ by sending appropriate\n   communities to their service provider.  Other applications\
    \ include\n   signaling various types of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) (e.g.,\n\
    \   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [VPLS]), and carrying link\n   bandwidth\
    \ for traffic engineering applications [RFC4360].\n   With the advent of large-scale\
    \ BGP data collection [RV] [RIS] (and\n   associated research), it has become\
    \ clear that the geographical and\n   topological information, as well as the\
    \ relationship the provider has\n   to the source of a route (e.g., transit, peer,\
    \ or customer), carried\n   in such communities is essential for a deeper understanding\
    \ of the\n   global routing system.  This memo defines standard communities for\n\
    \   export to BGP route collectors.  These communities represent a\n   significant\
    \ part of information carried by service providers as of\n   this writing, and\
    \ as such could be useful for internal use by service\n   providers.  However,\
    \ such use is beyond the scope of this memo.\n   Finally, those involved in BGP\
    \ data analysis are encouraged to verify\n   with their data sources as to which\
    \ peers implement this scheme (as\n   there is a large amount of existing data\
    \ as well as many legacy\n   peerings).\n   The remainder of this memo is organized\
    \ as follows.  Section 2\n   provides the definition of terms used as well as\
    \ the semantics of the\n   communities used for BGP data collection, and Section\
    \ 3 defines the\n   corresponding encodings for RFC 1997 [RFC1997] communities.\
    \  Finally,\n   Section 4 defines the encodings for use with extended communities\n\
    \   [RFC4360].\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions\n   In this section, we define the terms used and the categories\
    \ of\n   routes that may be tagged with communities.  This tagging is often\n\
    \   referred to as coloring, and we refer to a route's \"color\" as its\n   community\
    \ value.  The categories defined here are loosely modeled on\n   those described\
    \ in [WANG] and [HUSTON].\n"
- title: 2.1.  Peers and Peering
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Peers and Peering\n   Consider two network service providers, A and B.\
    \  Service providers A\n   and B are defined to be peers when (i) A and B exchange\
    \ routes via\n   BGP, and (ii) traffic exchange between A and B is settlement-free.\n\
    \   This arrangement is also typically known as \"peering\".  Peers\n   typically\
    \ exchange only their respective customer routes (see\n   \"Customer Routes\"\
    \ below), and hence exchange only their respective\n   customer traffic.  See\
    \ [HUSTON] for a more in-depth discussion of the\n   business models surrounding\
    \ peers and peering.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Customer Routes
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Customer Routes\n   Customer routes are those routes that are heard from\
    \ a customer via\n   BGP and are propagated to peers and other customers.  Note\
    \ that a\n   customer can be an enterprise or another network service provider.\n\
    \   These routes are sometimes called client routes [HUSTON].\n"
- title: 2.3.  Peer Routes
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Peer Routes\n   Peer routes are those routes heard from peers via BGP,\
    \ and not\n   propagated to other peers.  In particular, these routes are only\n\
    \   propagated to the service provider's customers.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Internal Routes
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Internal Routes\n   Internal routes are those routes that a service provider\
    \ originates\n   and passes to its peers and customers.  These routes are frequently\n\
    \   taken out of the address space allocated to a provider.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Internal More Specific Routes
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Internal More Specific Routes\n   Internal more specific routes are those\
    \ routes that are frequently\n   used for circuit load balancing purposes and\
    \ Interior Gateway\n   Protocol (IGP) route reduction.  They also may correspond\
    \ to customer\n   services that are not visible outside the service provider's\
    \ network.\n   Internal more specific routes are not exported to any external\
    \ peer.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Special Purpose Routes
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Special Purpose Routes\n   Special purpose routes are those routes that\
    \ do not fall into any of\n   the other classes described here.  In those cases\
    \ in which such\n   routes need to be distinguished, a service provider may color\
    \ such\n   routes with a unique value.  Examples of special purpose routes\n \
    \  include anycast routes and routes for overlay networks.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Upstream Routes
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Upstream Routes\n   Upstream routes are typically learned from an upstream\
    \ service\n   provider as part of a transit service contract executed with the\n\
    \   upstream provider.\n"
- title: 2.8.  National Routes
  contents:
  - "2.8.  National Routes\n   These are route sets that are sourced from and/or received\
    \ within a\n   particular country.\n"
- title: 2.9.  Regional Routes
  contents:
  - "2.9.  Regional Routes\n   Several global backbones implement regional policy\
    \ based on their\n   deployed footprint and on strategic and business imperatives.\n\
    \   Service providers often have settlement-free interconnections with an\n  \
    \ Autonomous System (AS) in one region, and that same AS is a customer\n   in\
    \ another region.  This mandates use of regional routing, including\n   community\
    \ attributes set by the network in question to allow easy\n   discrimination among\
    \ regional routes.  For example, service providers\n   may treat a route set received\
    \ from another service provider in\n   Europe differently than the same route\
    \ set received in North America,\n   as it is common practice to sell transit\
    \ in one region while peering\n   in the other.\n"
- title: 3.  RFC 1997 Community Encoding and Values
  contents:
  - "3.  RFC 1997 Community Encoding and Values\n   In this section, we provide RFC\
    \ 1997 [RFC1997] community values for\n   the categories described above.  RFC\
    \ 1997 communities are encoded as\n   BGP Type Code 8, and are treated as 32-bit\
    \ values ranging from\n   0x0000000 through 0xFFFFFFF.  The values 0x0000000 through\
    \ 0x0000FFFF\n   and 0xFFFF0000 through 0xFFFFFFFF are reserved.\n   The best\
    \ current practice among service providers is to use the\n   high-order two octets\
    \ to represent the provider's AS number, and the\n   low-order two octets to represent\
    \ the classification of the route, as\n   depicted below:\n      0           \
    \        1                   2                   3\n      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\

    \ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   where\
    \ <AS> is the 16-bit AS number.  For example, the encoding\n   0x2A7C029A would\
    \ represent the AS 10876 with value 666.\n"

  - "5.  Note on BGP UPDATE Packing\n   Note that data collection communities have\
    \ the potential of making\n   the attribute set of a specific route more unique\
    \ than it would be\n   otherwise (since each route collects data that is specific\
    \ to its\n   path inside one or more ASes).  This, in turn, can affect whether\n\
    \   multiple routes can be grouped in the same BGP update message, and it\n  \
    \ may lead to increased use of bandwidth, router CPU cycles, and\n   memory.\n"

  - "6.  Acknowledgements\n   The community encoding described in this memo germinated\
    \ from an\n   interesting suggestion from Akira Kato at WIDE.  In particular,\
    \ the\n   idea would be to use the collection community values to select paths\n\
    \   that would result in (hopefully) more efficient access to various\n   services.\
    \  For example, in the case of RFC 3258 [RFC3258] based DNS\n   anycast service,\
    \ BGP routers may see multiple paths to the same\n   prefix, and others might\
    \ be coming from the same origin with\n   different paths, but others might be\
    \ from different region/country\n   (with the same origin AS).\n   Joe Abley,\
    \ Randy Bush, Sean Donelan, Xenofontas Dimitropoulos, Vijay\n   Gill, John Heasley,\
    \ Geoff Huston, Steve Huter, Michael Patton,\n   Olivier Marce, Ryan McDowell,\
    \ Rob Rockell, Rob Thomas, Pekka Savola,\n   Patrick Verkaik, and Alex Zinin all\
    \ made many insightful comments on\n   early versions of this document.  Henk\
    \ Uijterwaal suggested the use\n   of the ISO-3166-2 country codes.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   While this memo introduces no additional security\
    \ considerations into\n   the BGP protocol, the information contained in the communities\n\
    \   defined in this memo may in some cases reveal network structure that\n   was\
    \ not previously visible outside the provider's network.  As a\n   result, care\
    \ should be taken when exporting such communities to route\n   collectors.  Finally,\
    \ routes exported to a route collector should\n   also be tagged with the NO_EXPORT\
    \ community (0xFFFFFF01).\n"
- title: 7.1.  Total Path Attribute Length
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Total Path Attribute Length\n   The communities described in this memo\
    \ are intended for use on egress\n   to a route collector.  Hence an operator\
    \ may choose to overwrite its\n   internal communities with the values specified\
    \ in this memo when\n   exporting routes to a route collector.  However, operators\
    \ should in\n   general ensure that the behavior of their BGP implementation is\n\
    \   well-defined when the addition of an attribute causes a PDU to exceed\n  \
    \ 4096 octets.  For example, since it is common practice to use\n   community\
    \ attributes to implement policy (among other functionality\n   such as allowing\
    \ customers to set attributes such as LOCAL_PREF), the\n   behavior of an implementation\
    \ when the attribute space overflows is\n   crucial.  Among other behaviors, an\
    \ implementation might usurp the\n   intended attribute data or otherwise cause\
    \ indeterminate failures.\n   These behaviors can result in unanticipated community\
    \ attribute sets,\n   and hence result in unintended policy implications.\n"
- title: 8.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   This memo assigns a new Sub-Type for the AS specific\
    \ extended\n   community type in the First Come First Served extended transitive\n\
    \   category.  The IANA has assigned Sub-Type 0x0008 as defined in\n   Section\
    \ 4.1.\n   In addition, the IANA has created two registries for BGP Data\n   Collection\
    \ Communities, one for standard communities and one for\n   extended communities.\
    \  Both of these registries will initially be\n   populated by the values described\
    \ in Section 4.  IETF Consensus, as\n   described in [RFC2434], usually through\
    \ the Global Routing Operations\n   Working Group (grow), is required for the\
    \ assignment of new values in\n   these registries (in particular, for <Value>\
    \ or <R> in the table of\n   values for the route categories in Section 4).\n"
