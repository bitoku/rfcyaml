- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is based on a profile of the\n\
    \   MPLS and Pseudowire (PW) procedures as specified in the MPLS Traffic\n   Engineering\
    \ (MPLS-TE), PW, and Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW)\n   architectures developed\
    \ by the Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF).  The International Telecommunication\
    \ Union Telecommunication\n   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has specified a Transport\
    \ Network\n   architecture.\n   This document provides a thesaurus for the interpretation\
    \ of MPLS-TP\n   terminology within the context of the ITU-T Transport Network\n\
    \   Recommendations.\n   It is important to note that MPLS-TP is applicable in\
    \ a wider set of\n   contexts than just Transport Networks.  The definitions presented\
    \ in\n   this document do not provide exclusive or complete interpretations of\n\
    \   MPLS-TP concepts.  This document simply allows the MPLS-TP terms to\n   be\
    \ applied within the Transport Network context.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) has been developed\
    \ by the IETF\n   to facilitate the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\
    \ (OAM)\n   of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) to be used in a Transport Network\n\
    \   environment as defined by the ITU-T.\n   The ITU-T has specified a Transport\
    \ Network architecture for the\n   transfer of signals from different technologies.\
    \  This architecture\n   forms the basis of many Recommendations within the ITU-T.\n\
    \   Because of the difference in historic background of MPLS, and\n   inherently\
    \ MPLS-TP (the Internet) and the Transport Network (ITU\n   Telecommunication\
    \ Sector), the terminology used is different.\n   This document provides a thesaurus\
    \ (the analogy to the Rosetta Stone\n   has been used within the working groups)\
    \ for the interpretation of\n   MPLS-TP terminology within the context of the\
    \ ITU-T Transport Network\n   Recommendations.  This allows MPLS-TP documents\
    \ to be generally\n   understood by those familiar with MPLS RFCs.  The definitions\n\

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Associated Bidirectional Path\n   An associated bidirectional path is a\
    \ path that supports traffic flow\n   in both directions but that is constructed\
    \ from a pair of\n   unidirectional paths (one for each direction) that are associated\n\
    \   with one another at the path's ingress/egress points.  An associated\n   bidirectional\
    \ path need not be a single management and operational\n   entity.  The forward\
    \ and backward directions are set up, monitored,\n   and protected independently.\
    \  As a consequence, they may or may not\n   follow the same route (links and\
    \ nodes) across the network.\n"

- title: 3.6.  Control Plane
  contents:

    \ path in case of a failure.  The control plane also performs\n   other functions\

- title: 3.15.  Layer Network
  contents:
  - "3.15.  Layer Network\n   \"Layer network\" is defined in [ITU-T_G.805].  A layer\

    \ to a higher client-layer network and may, in\n   turn, be a client to a lower-layer\
    \ network.  A layer network is a\n   logical construction somewhat independent\
    \ of arrangement or\n   composition of physical network elements.  A particular\
    \ physical\n   network element may topologically belong to more than one layer\n\
    \   network, depending on the actions it takes on the encapsulation\n   associated\
    \ with the logical layers (e.g., the label stack) and thus\n   could be modeled\

- title: 3.17.  Maintenance Entity (ME)
  contents:
  - "3.17.  Maintenance Entity (ME)\n   A Maintenance Entity (ME) can be viewed as\
    \ the association of two (or\n   more) Maintenance Entity Group End Points (MEPs)\
    \ that should be\n   configured and managed in order to bound the OAM responsibilities\
    \ of\n   an OAM flow across a network or sub-network, i.e., a transport path\n\
    \   or segment in the specific layer network that is being monitored and\n   managed.\

    \ [ITU-T_G.8113.2].\n   A Maintenance Entity may be defined to monitor and manage\n\
    \   bidirectional or unidirectional point-to-point connectivity or point-\n  \
    \ to-multipoint connectivity in an MPLS-TP layer network.\n   Therefore, in the\
    \ context of an MPLS-TP LSP ME or PW ME, Label Edge\n   Routers (LERs) and PW\
    \ Terminating Provider Edges (T-PEs) can be MEPs,\n   while LSRs and PW Switching\

    \   -  Each OAM flow is associated with a unique Maintenance Entity.\n   -  OAM\

  - "3.19.  Maintenance Entity Group End Point (MEP)\n   Maintenance Entity Group\
    \ End Points (MEPs) are the end points of a\n   pre-configured (through the management\
    \ or control planes) ME.  MEPs\n   are responsible for activating and controlling\
    \ all of the OAM\n   functionality for the ME.  A source MEP may initiate an OAM\
    \ packet to\n   be transferred to its corresponding peer MEP (called the sink\
    \ MEP) or\n   to an intermediate MIP that is part of the ME.  See also Section\
    \ 3.3\n   of [RFC6371] and Clause 6.3 of [ITU-T_G.8113.1] and [ITU-T_G.8113.2].\n\
    \   A sink MEP terminates all the OAM packets that it receives\n   corresponding\
    \ to its ME and does not forward them further along the\n   path.\n   All OAM\
    \ packets coming into a source MEP are tunneled via label\n   stacking and are\
    \ not processed within the ME as they belong either to\n   the client network\
    \ layers or to a higher Tandem Connection Monitoring\n   (TCM) level.\n   A MEP\
    \ in a tandem connection is not coincident with the termination\n   of the MPLS-TP\
    \ transport path (LSP or PW), though it can monitor its\n   connectivity (e.g.,\
    \ counts packets).  A MEP of an MPLS-TP network\n   transport path is coincident\
    \ with transport path termination and\n   monitors its connectivity (e.g., counts\
    \ packets).\n   An MPLS-TP sink MEP can notify a fault condition to its MPLS-TP\n\
    \   client-layer network.\n"

    \   There is a need to not only monitor the whole transport path (e.g.,\n   LSP\
    \ or MS-PW), but also arbitrary parts of transport paths.  The\n   connection\
    \ between any two arbitrary points along a transport path is\n   described in\

  contents:
  - "3.23.2.  Sub-Path Maintenance Element (SPME)\n   To monitor, protect, and manage\
    \ a portion (i.e., segment or\n   concatenated segment) of an LSP, a hierarchical\
    \ LSP [RFC3031] can be\n   instantiated.  A hierarchical LSP instantiated for\
    \ this purpose is\n   called a Sub-Path Maintenance Element (SPME).  Note that\
    \ by\n   definition, an SPME does not carry user traffic as a direct client.\n\
    \   An SPME is defined between the edges of the portion of the LSP that\n   needs\
    \ to be monitored, protected, or managed.  The SPME forms an\n   MPLS-TP Section\
    \ that carries the original LSP over this portion of\n   the network as a client.\
    \  OAM messages can be initiated at the edge\n   of the SPME and sent to the peer\
    \ edge of the SPME or to a MIP along\n   the SPME.  A P router only pushes or\
    \ pops a label if it is at the end\n   of an SPME.  In this mode, it is an LER\
    \ for the SPME.\n"
- title: 3.23.3.  Tandem Connection
  contents:
  - "3.23.3.  Tandem Connection\n   A tandem connection is an arbitrary part of a\
    \ transport path that can\n   be monitored (via OAM) independently from the end-to-end\
    \ monitoring\n   (OAM).  It may be a monitored segment, a monitored concatenated\n\
    \   segment, or any other monitored ordered sequence of contiguous hops\n   and/or\
    \ segments (and their interconnecting nodes) of a transport\n   path.\n   Tandem\
    \ Connection Monitoring (TCM) for a given path segment of a\n   transport path\
    \ is implemented by creating a Path Segment Tunnel that\n   has a 1:1 association\
    \ with the path segment of the transport path\n   that is to be uniquely monitored.\
    \  This means that the PST used to\n   provide TCM can carry one and only one\
    \ transport path, thus allowing\n   direct correlation between all fault-management\
    \ and performance-\n   monitoring information gathered for the PST and the monitored\
    \ path\n   segment of the end-to-end transport path.  The PST is monitored using\n\
    \   normal LSP monitoring.  See also Section 3.2 of [RFC6371] and\n   Clause 6.2.1\
