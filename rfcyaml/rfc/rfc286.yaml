  - "                   Network Library Information System\n        Georgetown University\
    \ is designing a Learning Resource Center\n   (LRC), part of which may consist\
    \ of a system to enable computer query\n   (hopefully on-line) of G.U.'s Library\
    \ holdings.  The ARPA community\n   might be of assistance in either of two ways:\n\
    \        1.  One or more organizations may have a Library Retrieval\n        \
    \    System that they would like to share with Georgetown.\n        2.  Since\
    \ there probably are needs for such a system at most\n            organizations,\
    \ and since it would be highly beneficial\n            for one organization to\
    \ be able to query other library\n            holdings as well, and subsequently\
    \ arrange for inter-\n            library loans, the ARPA community might undertake\
    \ to\n            design a Network Library Information System.\n        If sufficient\
    \ interest in such a system exists, a working group\n   could be set up to establish\
    \ the necessary protocols and iron out\n   details of the system.\n        It\
    \ is probable that the NIC could provide valuable inputs to such\n   an undertaking\
    \ and perhaps would serve as a focal point for the system\n   design and operation.\n\
    \        Please contact me if either:\n        1.  You have, or know of a Library\
    \ Retrieval System that\n            can be shared with Georgetown University,\n\
    \        2.  Your organization is interested in participating in a\n         \
    \   Network Library Retrieval System, or\n        3.  You are interested in participating\
    \ in designing such a\n            system.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp.\
