  - "Abstract\n   At present, an IS-IS purge does not contain any information\n   identifying
    the Intermediate System (IS) that generates the purge.\n   This makes it difficult
    to locate the source IS.\n   To address this issue, this document defines a TLV
    to be added to\n   purges to record the system ID of the IS generating it.  Since
    normal\n   Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP) flooding does not change LSP\n
    \  contents, this TLV should propagate with the purge.\n   This document updates
    RFC 5301, RFC 5304, and RFC 5310.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IS-IS [ISO-10589] routing protocol has been widely used
    in large-\n   scale IP networks because of its strong scalability and fast\n   convergence.\n
    \  The IS-IS protocol floods purges throughout an area, regardless of\n   which
    IS initiated the purge.  If a network operator would like to\n   investigate the
    cause of the purge, it is difficult to determine the\n   origin of the purge.
    \ At present, the IS-IS protocol has no mechanism\n   to locate the originator
    of a purge.  To address this problem, this\n   document defines a TLV to be added
    to purges to record the system ID\n   of the IS generating the purge.\n   Field
    experience has shown several circumstances where an IS can\n   improperly generate
    a purge.  These are all due to implementation\n   deficiencies or implementations
    that predate [ISO-TC1] and generate a\n   purge when they receive a corrupted
    Link State Protocol Data Unit\n   (LSP).\n"

    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 2.  Requirements Language

  - "3.  The Purge Originator Identification (POI) TLV\n   This document defines a
    TLV to be included in purges.  If an IS\n   generates a purge, it SHOULD include
    this TLV in the purge with its\n   own system ID.  If an IS receives a purge that
    does not include this\n   TLV, then it SHOULD add this TLV with both its own system
    ID and the\n   system ID of the IS from which it received the purge.  This allows\n
    \  ISs receiving purges to log the system ID of the originator, or the\n   upstream
    source of the purge.  This makes it much easier for the\n   network administrator
    to locate the origin of the purge and thus the\n   cause of the purge.  Similarly,
    this TLV is helpful to developers in\n   lab situations.\n   The POI TLV is defined
    as:\n      CODE - 13\n      LENGTH - total length of the value field.\n      VALUE
    -\n         Number of system IDs carried in this TLV (1 octet) -- only the\n         values
    1 and 2 are defined.\n         System ID of the Intermediate System that inserted
    this TLV.\n         System ID of the Intermediate System from which the purge
    was\n         received (optional).\n   The POI TLV SHOULD be found in all purges
    and MUST NOT be found in\n   LSPs with a non-zero Remaining Lifetime.\n"
  title: 3.  The Purge Originator Identification (POI) TLV
- contents:
  - "4.  Using the Dynamic Hostname TLV in Purges\n   This document also extends the
    use of the Dynamic hostname TLV\n   (type 137) [RFC5301] to further aid in the
    rapid identification of\n   the system that generated the purge.  This TLV MAY
    be included in\n   purges.  Implementations SHOULD include one instance of the
    Dynamic\n   hostname TLV if the POI TLV is included.  Only the local hostname\n
    \  should be inserted.\n"

- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Use of the extensions defined here, with authentication
    as defined in\n   [RFC5304] or [RFC5310], will result in the discarding of purges
    by\n   legacy systems that are in strict conformance with either of those\n   RFCs.
    \ This may compromise the correctness/consistency of the routing\n   database
    unless all ISs in the network support these extensions.\n   Therefore, all implementations
    in a domain implementing\n   authentication MUST be upgraded to receive the POI
    TLV before any IS\n   is allowed to generate a purge with the POI TLV.\n   More
    interactions between the POI TLV, the Dynamic hostname TLV, and\n   the Authentication
    TLV are described in [RFC6233].\n"

  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has assigned code point 13 for the 'Purge Originator\n
    \  Identification' TLV from the IS-IS 'TLV Codepoints' registry.  The\n   additional
    values for this TLV should be IIH:n, LSP:y, SNP:n, and\n   Purge:y.\n"
