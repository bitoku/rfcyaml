  - "Abstract\n   The widespread adoption of Ethernet L2VPN services and the advent\
    \ of\n   new applications for the technology (e.g., data center interconnect)\n\
    \   have culminated in a new set of requirements that are not readily\n   addressable\
    \ by the current Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)\n   solution.  In particular,\
    \ multihoming with all-active forwarding is\n   not supported, and there's no\
    \ existing solution to leverage\n   Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched\
    \ Paths (LSPs) for\n   optimizing the delivery of multi-destination frames.  Furthermore,\n\
    \   the provisioning of VPLS, even in the context of BGP-based auto-\n   discovery,\
    \ requires network operators to specify various network\n   parameters on top\
    \ of the access configuration.  This document\n   specifies the requirements for\
    \ an Ethernet VPN (EVPN) solution, which\n   addresses the above issues.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), as defined in [RFC4664],\n\
    \   [RFC4761], and [RFC4762], is a proven and widely deployed technology.\n  \
    \ However, the existing solution has a number of limitations when it\n   comes\
    \ to redundancy, multicast optimization, and provisioning\n   simplicity.  Furthermore,\
    \ new applications are driving several new\n   requirements for other L2VPN services\
    \ such as Ethernet Tree (E-Tree)\n   and Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS).\n\
    \   In the area of multihoming, current VPLS can only support multihoming\n  \
    \ with the single-active redundancy mode (defined in Section 3), for\n   example,\
    \ as described in [VPLS-BGP-MH].  Flexible multihoming with\n   all-active redundancy\
    \ mode (defined in Section 3) cannot be supported\n   by the current VPLS solution.\n\
    \   In the area of multicast optimization, [RFC7117] describes how\n   multicast\
    \ LSPs can be used in conjunction with VPLS.  However, this\n   solution is limited\
    \ to Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) LSPs, as there's no\n   defined solution for leveraging\
    \ Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs\n   with VPLS.\n   In the area of provisioning\
    \ simplicity, current VPLS does offer a\n   mechanism for single-sided provisioning\
    \ by relying on BGP-based\n   service auto-discovery [RFC4761] [RFC6074].  This,\
    \ however, still\n   requires the operator to configure a number of network-side\n\
    \   parameters on top of the access-side Ethernet configuration.\n   In the area\
    \ of data-center interconnect, applications are driving the\n   need for new service\
    \ interface types that are a hybrid combination of\n   VLAN bundling and VLAN-based\
    \ service interfaces.  These are referred\n   to as \"VLAN-aware bundling\" service\
    \ interfaces.\n   Virtualization applications are also fueling an increase in\
    \ the\n   volume of MAC (Media Access Control) addresses that are to be handled\n\
    \   by the network; this gives rise to the requirement for having the\n   network\
    \ reconvergence upon failure be independent of the number of\n   MAC addresses\
    \ learned by the Provider Edge (PE).\n   There are requirements for minimizing\
    \ the amount of flooding of\n   multi-destination frames and localizing the flooding\
    \ to the confines\n   of a given site.\n   There are also requirements for supporting\
    \ flexible VPN topologies\n   and policies beyond those currently covered by VPLS\
    \ and Hierarchical\n   VPLS (H-VPLS).\n   The focus of this document is on defining\
    \ the requirements for a new\n   solution, namely, Ethernet VPN (EVPN), which\
    \ addresses the above\n   issues.\n   Section 4 discusses the redundancy requirements.\
    \  Section 5 describes\n   the multicast optimization requirements.  Section 6\
    \ articulates the\n   ease of provisioning requirements.  Section 7 focuses on\
    \ the new\n   service interface requirements.  Section 8 highlights the fast\n\
    \   convergence requirements.  Section 9 describes the flood suppression\n   requirement,\
    \ and finally Section 10 discusses the requirements for\n   supporting flexible\
    \ VPN topologies and policies.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Flow-Based Load Balancing
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Flow-Based Load Balancing\n   A common mechanism for multihoming a CE node\
    \ to a set of PE nodes\n   involves leveraging multi-chassis Ethernet link aggregation\
    \ groups\n   (LAGs) based on [802.1AX].  [PWE3-ICCP] describes one such scheme.\n\
    \   In Ethernet link aggregation, the load-balancing algorithms by which\n   a\
    \ CE distributes traffic over the Attachment Circuits connecting to\n   the PEs\
    \ are quite flexible.  The only requirement is for the\n   algorithm to ensure\
    \ in-order frame delivery for a given traffic flow.\n   In typical implementations,\
    \ these algorithms involve selecting an\n   outbound link within the bundle based\
    \ on a hash function that\n   identifies a flow based on one or more of the following\
    \ fields:\n   i.   Layer 2: Source MAC Address, Destination MAC Address, VLAN\n\
    \   ii.  Layer 3: Source IP Address, Destination IP Address\n   iii. Layer 4:\
    \ UDP or TCP Source Port, Destination Port\n   A key point to note here is that\
    \ [802.1AX] does not define a standard\n   load-balancing algorithm for Ethernet\
    \ bundles, and, as such,\n   different implementations behave differently.  As\
    \ a matter of fact, a\n   bundle operates correctly even in the presence of asymmetric\
    \ load\n   balancing over the links.  This being the case, the first requirement\n\
    \   for all-active multihoming is the ability to accommodate flexible\n   flow-based\
    \ load balancing from the CE node based on L2, L3, and/or L4\n   header fields.\n\
    \   (R1a) A solution MUST be capable of supporting flexible flow-based\n     \
    \    load balancing from the CE as described above.\n   (R1b) A solution MUST\
    \ also be able to support flow-based load\n         balancing of traffic destined\
    \ to the CE, even when the CE is\n         connected to more than one PE.  Thus,\
    \ the solution MUST be able\n         to exercise multiple links connected to\
    \ the CE, irrespective of\n         the number of PEs that the CE is connected\
    \ to.\n   It should be noted that when a CE is multihomed to several PEs, there\n\
    \   could be multiple Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) paths from each remote\n   PE\
    \ to each multihoming PE.  Furthermore, for an all-active multihomed\n   CE, a\
    \ remote PE can choose any of the multihoming PEs for sending\n   traffic destined\
    \ to the multihomed CE.  Therefore, when a solution\n   supports all-active multihoming,\
    \ it MUST exercise as many of these\n   paths as possible for traffic destined\
    \ to a multihomed CE.\n   (R1c) A solution SHOULD support flow-based load balancing\
    \ among PEs\n         that are members of a redundancy group spanning multiple\n\
    \         Autonomous Systems.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Flow-Based Multipathing
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Flow-Based Multipathing\n   Any solution that meets the all-active redundancy\
    \ mode (e.g., flow-\n   based load balancing) described in Section 4.1, also needs\
    \ to\n   exercise multiple paths between a given pair of PEs.  For instance,\n\
    \   if there are two or more LSPs between a remote PE and a pair of PEs\n   in\
    \ an all-active redundancy group, then the solution needs to be\n   capable of\
    \ load balancing traffic among those LSPs on a per-flow\n   basis for traffic\
    \ destined to the PEs in the redundancy group.\n   Furthermore, if there are two\
    \ or more ECMP paths between a remote PE\n   and one of the PEs in the redundancy\
    \ group, then the solution needs\n   to leverage all the equal-cost LSPs.  For\
    \ the latter, the solution\n   can also leverage the load-balancing capabilities\
    \ based on entropy\n   labels [RFC6790].\n   (R2a) A solution MUST be able to\
    \ exercise all LSPs between a remote\n         PE and all the PEs in the redundancy\
    \ group with all-active\n         multihoming.\n   (R2b) A solution MUST be able\
    \ to exercise all ECMP paths between a\n         remote PE and any of the PEs\
    \ in the redundancy group with all-\n         active multihoming.\n   For example,\
    \ consider a scenario in which CE1 is multihomed to PE1\n   and PE2, and CE2 is\
    \ multihomed to PE3 and PE4 running in all-active\n   redundancy mode.  Furthermore,\
    \ consider that there exist three ECMP\n   paths between any of the CE1's and\
    \ CE2's multihomed PEs.  Traffic\n   from CE1 to CE2 can be forwarded on twelve\
    \ different paths over the\n   MPLS/IP core as follows: CE1 load balances traffic\
    \ to both PE1 and\n   PE2.  Each of PE1 and PE2 have three ECMP paths to PE3 and\
    \ PE4 for a\n   total of twelve paths.  Finally, when traffic arrives at PE3 and\
    \ PE4,\n   it gets forwarded to CE2 over the Ethernet channel (aka link bundle).\n\
    \   It is worth pointing out that flow-based multipathing complements\n   flow-based\
    \ load balancing described in the previous section.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Geo-redundant PE Nodes
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Geo-redundant PE Nodes\n   The PE nodes offering multihomed connectivity\
    \ to a CE or access\n   network may be situated in the same physical location\
    \ (co-located),\n   or may be spread geographically (e.g., in different Central\
    \ Offices\n   (COs) or Points of Presence (POPs)).  The latter is needed when\n\
    \   offering a geo-redundant solution that ensures business continuity\n   for\
    \ critical applications in the case of power outages, natural\n   disasters, etc.\
    \  An all-active multihoming mechanism needs to support\n   both co-located as\
    \ well as geo-redundant PE placement.  The latter\n   scenario often means that\
    \ requiring a dedicated link between the PEs,\n   for the operation of the multihoming\
    \ mechanism, is not appealing from\n   a cost standpoint.  Furthermore, the IGP\
    \ cost from remote PEs to the\n   pair of PEs in the dual-homed setup cannot be\
    \ assumed to be the same\n   when those latter PEs are geo-redundant.\n   (R3a)\
    \ A solution MUST support all-active multihoming without the need\n         for\
    \ a dedicated control/data link among the PEs in the\n         multihomed group.\n\
    \   (R3b) A solution MUST support different IGP costs from a remote PE to\n  \
    \       each of the PEs in a multihomed group.\n   (R3c) A solution MUST support\
    \ multihoming across different IGP\n         domains within the same Autonomous\
    \ System.\n   (R3d) A solution SHOULD support multihoming across multiple\n  \
    \       Autonomous Systems.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Optimal Traffic Forwarding
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Optimal Traffic Forwarding\n   In a typical network, when considering a\
    \ designated pair of PEs, it\n   is common to find both single-homed as well as\
    \ multihomed CEs being\n   connected to those PEs.\n   (R4)  An all-active multihoming\
    \ solution SHOULD support optimal\n         forwarding of unicast traffic for\
    \ all the following scenarios.\n         By \"optimal forwarding\", we mean that\

  contents:
  - "4.5.  Support for Flexible Redundancy Grouping\n   (R5) In order to support flexible\
    \ redundancy grouping, the\n         multihoming mechanism SHOULD allow arbitrary\
    \ grouping of PE\n         nodes into redundancy groups where each redundancy\
    \ group\n         represents all multihomed devices/networks that share the same\n\
    \         group of PEs.\n   This is best explained with an example: consider three\
    \ PE nodes --\n   PE1, PE2, and PE3.  The multihoming mechanism MUST allow a given\
    \ PE,\n   say, PE1, to be part of multiple redundancy groups concurrently.  For\n\
    \   example, there can be a group (PE1, PE2), a group (PE1, PE3), and\n   another\
    \ group (PE2, PE3) where CEs could be multihomed to any one of\n   these three\
    \ redundancy groups.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Multihomed Network
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Multihomed Network\n   There are applications that require an Ethernet\
    \ network, rather than\n   a single device, to be multihomed to a group of PEs.\
    \  The Ethernet\n   network would typically run a resiliency mechanism such as\
    \ Multiple\n   Spanning Tree Protocol [802.1Q] or Ethernet Ring Protection Switching\n\
    \   [G.8032].  The PEs may or may not participate in the control protocol\n  \

    \ these protocols require that each VLAN to be active only\n   on one of the multihomed\
    \ links.\n   (R6a) A solution MUST support multihomed network connectivity with\n\

    \ for all the ports belonging to that service instance,\n   regardless of the\
    \ number of VLANs coming through these ports.\n   It is worth noting that the\
    \ term 'bridge domain' as used above refers\n   to a MAC forwarding table as defined\
    \ in the IEEE bridge model and\n   does not denote or imply any specific implementation.\n\
    \   [RFC4762] defines two types of VPLS services based on \"unqualified\n   and\
    \ qualified learning\", which in turn maps to port mode and VLAN\n   mode, respectively.\n\
    \   (R9a) A solution MUST support the above three service types (port\n      \
    \   mode, VLAN mode, and VLAN bundling).\n   For hosted applications for data-center\
    \ interconnect, network\n   operators require the ability to extend Ethernet VLANs\
    \ over a WAN\n   using a single L2VPN instance while maintaining data-plane separation\n\
    \   between the various VLANs associated with that instance.  This is\n   referred\
    \ to as 'VLAN-aware bundling service'.\n   (R9b) A solution MAY support VLAN-aware\
    \ bundling service.\n   This gives rise to two new service interface types: VLAN-aware\n\
    \   bundling without translation and VLAN-aware bundling with\n   translation.\n\
    \   The service interface for VLAN-aware bundling without translation has\n  \
    \ the following characteristics:\n   -  The service interface provides bundling\
    \ of customer VLANs into a\n      single L2VPN service instance.\n   -  The service\
    \ interface guarantees customer VLAN transparency end to\n      end.\n   -  The\
    \ service interface maintains data-plane separation between the\n      customer\
    \ VLANs (i.e., creates a dedicated bridge-domain per VLAN).\n   In the special\
    \ case of all-to-one bundling, the service interface\n   must not assume any a\
    \ priori knowledge of the customer VLANs.  In\n   other words, the customer VLANs\
    \ shall not be configured on the PE;\n   rather, the interface is configured just\
    \ like a port-based service.\n   The service interface for VLAN-aware bundling\
    \ with translation has\n   the following characteristics:\n   -  The service interface\
    \ provides bundling of customer VLANs into a\n      single L2VPN service instance.\n\
    \   -  The service interface maintains data-plane separation between the\n   \
    \   customer VLANs (i.e., creates a dedicated bridge-domain per VLAN).\n   - \
    \ The service interface supports customer VLAN ID translation to\n      handle\
    \ the scenario where different VLAN Identifiers (VIDs) are\n      used on different\
    \ interfaces to designate the same customer VLAN.\n   The main difference, in\
    \ terms of service-provider resource\n   allocation, between these new service\
    \ types and the previously\n   defined three types is that the new services require\
    \ several bridge\n   domains to be allocated (one per customer VLAN) per L2VPN\
    \ service\n   instance as opposed to a single bridge domain per L2VPN service\n\
    \   instance.\n"
