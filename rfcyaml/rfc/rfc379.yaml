  - "----------------\n    (1)  Conversational Remote Job Entry\n         Using TSO\
    \ you can prepare an OS job stream using the TSO EDIT command,\n         SUBMIT\
    \ the job to batch execution, monitor its STATUS, and ship the\n         OUTPUT\
    \ back to EDIT for examination.  This allows those of you with\n         TIP'S\
    \ to process jobs at CCN without using NETRJS via a friendly\n         TENEX machine.\
    \  Any batch job can be submitted this way.\n    (2)  Foreground Execution\n \
    \        --------------------\n         Many OS/360 programs can be run, with\
    \ varying degrees of inconvenience,\n         directly from the terminal.  There\
    \ are TSO commands providing the\n         facilities of EXEC and DD cards; the\
    \ output stream can be directed to\n         the user's terminal.  There are some\
    \ important limitations to fore-\n         ground operation, however:\n      \
    \        (1)  The foreground region size is limited; at present, it is\n     \
    \              128K, though this will be expanded.\n              (3)  Since you\
    \ are time-sliced and swapped, it can be very\n                   slow.\n    There\
    \ are two important cases of foreground execution:\n         (A)  The TEST command\
    \ provides DDT-like debugging capability\n              for foreground programs.\n\
    \         (B)  The user's own program can interact with his terminal.\n"

    \     the current server Telnet, complete with an annoying bug.  A later\n   \
    \  version will include the following capabilities not presently available:\n\
    \          (a)  \"FULL DUPLEX\", i.e., CCN echoing.\n          (b)  Lower case\

    \ datasets created in the foreground (e.g., by\n     EDIT or ALLOC) on the proper\
    \ resident disk pack.  All TSO datasets are\n     cataloged, and can be referenced\
