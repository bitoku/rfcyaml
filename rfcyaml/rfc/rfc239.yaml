  - "                  HOST MNEMONICS PROPOSED IN RFC #226\n   (Note from NIC: These\
    \ are comments sent by R.Braden to P. Karp in NIC\n   7626, and are now issued\
    \ as NIC 7664, RFC 239 to include them in the\n   dialogue along with RFC 226,\
    \ 229, 236)\n        CCN is in full agreement that a standard set of host mnemonics\n\
    \   should be selected.  However, your proposed set is not fully\n   satisfactory.\n\
    \   1.  The set you suggest was created, I assume, by the systems\n       programmer(s)\
    \ who wrote TELNET in TENEX.  It is a set of\n       historical accidents, and\
    \ shows it.\n   2.  A better source for standard mnemonics might be the NIC site\n\
    \       codes, since these have been chosen with more care and will\n       become\
    \ familiar as we begin to use the NIC on-line.  Surely\n       the NIC is a more\
    \ reasonable source for a defacto standard\n       than a particular system programmer.\n\
    \   3.  Should mnemonics be limited to 6 characters?\n   4.  The most recent list\
    \ from BBN (NIC #7181, RFC #208,\n       August 9, 1971) shows 40 hosts.  You\
    \ show only 20.  Your\n       proposed standard should include known hosts at\
    \ this time.\n   5.  The mnemonic \"UCLA36\" seems a particularly bad choice;\
    \ \"UCLA91\"\n       would be much better.\n   6.  Also, we at CCN object to the\
    \ short form \"UCLA\" for the NMC\n       Sigma 7; that also is historical.  We\
    \ propose the following:\n           host 1: UCLAS7 or UCLANM;         host 65:\
    \ UCLA91.\n   7.  \"SRIARC\" is a poor choice; everybody calls it the NIC.  So\
    \ we\n       suggest \"SRINIC\" for host 2.\n        Please, let's not perpetrate\
    \ systems programmers' midnight\n   decisions on all future Network users!  Standards\
    \ are vital, and\n   deserve a little care.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp.\
    \ under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96\
    \   ]\n"
