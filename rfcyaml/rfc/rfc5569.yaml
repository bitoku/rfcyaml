    \        IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd)\n"
- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   IPv6 rapid deployment on IPv4 infrastructures (6rd) builds upon\n\
    \   mechanisms of 6to4 to enable a service provider to rapidly deploy\n   IPv6\
    \ unicast service to IPv4 sites to which it provides customer\n   premise equipment.\
    \  Like 6to4, it utilizes stateless IPv6 in IPv4\n   encapsulation in order to\
    \ transit IPv4-only network infrastructure.\n   Unlike 6to4, a 6rd service provider\
    \ uses an IPv6 prefix of its own in\n   place of the fixed 6to4 prefix.  A service\
    \ provider has used this\n   mechanism for its own IPv6 \"rapid deployment\":\
    \ five weeks from first\n   exposure to 6rd principles to more than 1,500,000\
    \ residential sites\n   being provided native IPv6, under the only condition that\
    \ they\n   activate it.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   After having had a succinct presentation of the 6rd idea,\
    \ a major\n   French Internet service provider (ISP), Free of the Iliad group\n\
    \   (hereafter Free), did all of the following in an impressively short\n   delay\
    \ of only five weeks (November 7th to December 11th 2007):\n   1.  obtained from\
    \ its regional Internet Registry (RIR) an IPv6\n       prefix, the length of which\
    \ was that allocated without a\n       justification and a delay to examine it,\
    \ namely /32;\n   2.  added 6rd support to the software of its Freebox home-gateway\n\
    \       (upgrading for this an available 6to4 code);\n   3.  provisioned PC-compatible\
    \ platform with a 6to4 gateway software;\n   4.  modified it to support 6rd;\n\
    \   5.  tested IPv6 operation with several operating systems and\n       applications;\n\
    \   6.  finished operational deployment, by means of new version of the\n    \
    \   downloadable software of their Freeboxes;\n   7.  announced IPv6 Internet\
    \ connectivity, at no extra charge, for all\n       its customers wishing to activate\
    \ it.\n   More than 1,500,000 residential customers thus became able to use\n\
    \   IPv6 if they wished, with all the look and feel of native IPv6\n   addresses\
    \ routed in IPv6.  The only condition was an activation of\n   IPv6 in their Freeboxes,\
    \ and of course in their IPv6-capable hosts.\n   This story is reported to illustrate\
    \ that ISPs that provide customer\n   premise equipment (CPE) to their clients,\
    \ with included routing\n   capability, and that have so far postponed IPv6 deployment\
    \ can, with\n   the dramatically reduced investment and operational costs that\
    \ 6rd\n   make possible, decide to wait no longer.\n   To complete the story,\
    \ Free announced, on March 6th 2008, that\n   provided two of its customer sites\
    \ had IPv6 activated, its Telesites\n   application (Web sites published on TV)\
    \ could now be used remotely\n   between them.\n   While IPv6 availability was\
    \ limited in December 2007 to only one IPv6\n   link per customer site (with /64\
    \ site-prefix assignments).  A few\n   months later, after Free had detailed its\
    \ achievement and plans to\n   its RIR, and then obtained from it a /26 prefix,\
    \ up to 16 IPv6 links\n   per customer became possible (with /60 site-prefix assignments).\n\
    \   Readers are supposed to be familiar with 6to4 [RFC3056].\n"
- title: 2.  Problem Statement and Purpose of 6rd
  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statement and Purpose of 6rd\n   Having ISPs to rapidly bring IPv6\
    \ to customers' sites, in addition to\n   IPv4 and without extra charge, is a\
    \ way to break the existing vicious\n   circle that has delayed IPv6 deployment:\
    \ ISPs wait for customer\n   demand before deploying IPv6; customers don't demand\
    \ IPv6 as long as\n   application vendors announce that their products work on\
    \ existing\n   infrastructures (that are IPv4 with NATs); application vendors\
    \ focus\n   their investments on NAT traversal compatibility as long as ISPs\n\
    \   don't deploy IPv6.\n   But most ISPs are not willing to add IPv6 to their\
    \ current offer at\n   no charge unless incurred investment and operational costs\
    \ are\n   extremely limited.  For this, ISPs that provide router CPEs to their\n\
    \   customers have the most favorable conditions: they can upgrade their\n   router\
    \ CPEs and can operate gateways between their IPv4\n   infrastructures and the\
    \ global IPv6 Internet to support IPv6\n   encapsulation in IPv4.  They then need\
    \ no more routing plans than\n   those that exist on these IPv4 infrastructures.\n\
    \   Encapsulation a la 6to4, as specified in [RFC3056], is very close to\n   being\
    \ sufficient for this: it is simple; it is supported on many\n   platforms including\
    \ PC-compatible appliances; open-source portable\n   code is available; its stateless\
    \ nature ensures good scalability.\n   There is however a limitation of 6to4 that\
    \ prevents ISPs from using\n   it to offer full IPv6 unicast connectivity to their\
    \ customers.  While\n   an ISP that deploys 6to4 can guarantee that IPv6 packets\
    \ outgoing\n   from its customer sites will reach the IPv6 Internet, and also\n\
    \   guarantee that packets coming from other 6to4 sites will reach its\n   customer\
    \ sites, it cannot guarantee that packets from native IPv6\n   sites will reach\
    \ them.  The problem is that a packet coming from a\n   native IPv6 address needs\
    \ to traverse, somewhere on its way, a 6to4\n   relay router to do the required\
    \ IPv6/IPv4 encapsulation.  There is no\n   guarantee that routes toward such\
    \ a relay exist from everywhere, nor\n   is there a guarantee that all such relays\
    \ do forward packets toward\n   the complete IPv4 Internet.\n   Also, if an ISP\
    \ operates one or several 6to4 relay routers and opens\n   IPv6 routes toward\
    \ them in the IPv6 Internet, for the 6to4 prefix\n   2002::/16, it may receive\
    \ in these relays packets destined to an\n   unknown number of other 6to4 ISPs.\
    \  If it doesn't forward these\n   packets, it creates a black hole in which packets\
    \ may be\n   systematically lost, breaking some of the IPv6 connectivity.  If\
    \ it\n   does forward them, it can no longer dimension its 6to4 relay routers\n\
    \   in proportion to the traffic of its own customers.  Quality of\n   service,\
    \ at least for customers of other 6to4 ISPs, will then hardly\n   be guaranteed.\n\
    \   The purpose of 6rd is to slightly modify 6to4 so that:\n   1.  Packets that,\
    \ coming from the global Internet, enter 6rd gateways\n       of an ISP are only\
    \ packets destined to customer sites of this\n       ISP.\n   2.  All IPv6 packets\
    \ destined to 6rd customer sites of an ISP, and\n       coming from anywhere else\
    \ on the IPv6 Internet, traverse a 6rd\n       gateway of this ISP.\n"
- title: 3.  Specification
  contents:
  - "3.  Specification\n   The principle of 6rd is that, to build on 6to4 and suppress\
    \ its\n   limitation, it is sufficient that:\n   1.  6to4 functions are modified\
    \ to replace the standard 6to4 prefix\n       2002::/16 by an IPv6 prefix that\
    \ belongs to the ISP-assigned\n       address space, and to replace the 6to4 anycast\
    \ address by another\n       anycast address chosen by the ISP.\n   2.  The ISP\
    \ operates one or several 6rd gateways (upgraded 6to4\n       routers) at its\
    \ border between its IPv4 infrastructure and the\n       IPv6 Internet.\n   3.\

    \ 2: ISP Architecture to Deploy IPv6 with 6rd\n   NOTE: The chosen address format\
    \ uses 32 bits of IPv4 addresses in\n   IPv6 addresses for reasons of simplicity\
    \ and of compatibility with\n   the existing 6to4 code.  Limiting initially Free's\
    \ customer sites to\n   one IPv6 subnet per site, a consequence of Free's initial\
    \ prefix\n   being a /32, was not a significant restriction: since Free's\n  \
    \ customers are essentially residential, most of them would have been\n   unable\
    \ to use several subnets anyway, and as soon as Free would get a\n   prefix shorter\
    \ than /32, this restriction would be relaxed.  If it\n   had been important to\
    \ immediately use less than 32 bits of IPv4\n   addresses in IPv6 prefixes, this\
    \ would have been possible.  Since\n   Free, like many ISPs, had several RIR-allocated\
    \ IPv4 prefixes (6 of\n   them, having lengths from /10 to /16 in the particular\
    \ case), 6rd\n   gateways and 6rd CPEs could for this have implemented variable-length\n\
    \   mapping table.  But some of the IPv4 addressing entropy would thus\n   have\
    \ been extended to 6rd gateways and CPEs.  Complexity being then\n   significantly\
    \ higher, this would have defeated the objective of\n   extreme simplicity to\
    \ favor actual and rapid deployment.\n   IPv6 communication between customer sites\
    \ of a same ISP is direct\n   across the ISP IPv4 infrastructure: when a CPE sees\
    \ that the IPv6\n   destination address of an outgoing packet starts with its\
    \ own 6rd\n   relay ISPv6 prefix, it takes the 32 bits that follow this prefix\
    \ as\n   IPv4 destination of the encapsulating packet.  (Sending and\n   decapsulation\
    \ rules of 6to4, duly adapted to the 6rd prefix in place\n   of the 6to4 prefix,\
    \ apply as described in Section 5.3 of [RFC3056].)\n   The IPv4 anycast address\
    \ of 6rd relays may be chosen independently by\n   each ISP.  The only constraint\
    \ is that routes toward the ISP that are\n   advertised must not include this\
    \ address.  For example, Free took a\n   192.88.99.201 address, routed with the\
    \ same /24 prefix as 6to4 but\n   with 201 instead of 1 to avoid confusion with\
    \ 192.88.99.1, the 6to4\n   anycast address of [RFC3068].  Another possibility,\
    \ not retained,\n   would have been to use the anycast address of 6to4 and to\
    \ add, in\n   relays, a test on the IPv6 prefix of the ISP-side address.  If it\n\
    \   starts with 2002::/16, the packet is 6to4, not 6rd.\n"

    \ 3: 6rd Applicability to ISPs That Assign\n                          IPv4 Private\
    \ Addresses\n   Free currently offers a global IPv4 address to each of its\n \
    \  subscribers, which ensures that all IPv4-derived prefixes using 6rd\n   are\
    \ unique.  Service providers may no longer have this luxury as\n   available global\
    \ IPv4 addresses become more and more scarce.  This\n   section describes how\
    \ 6rd could be used by a service provider who\n   cannot provide global IPv4 addresses\
    \ to each subscriber.\n   If an ISP has assigned to customer sites addresses of\
    \ an IPv4 private\n   space of [RFC1918], typically 10.x.x.x addresses, it can\
    \ also use 6rd\n   to offer IPv6 to these sites.\n   IPv4 packets that contain\
    \ IPv6 packets don't go to NATs that this ISP\n   needs to operate in its infrastructure:\
    \ they go directly to 6rd\n   relays because their destination is the 6rd relay\
    \ anycast address.\n   It can be noted that in this case, the 10.0.0.0/8 prefix\
    \ is common to\n   all IPv4 addresses of the addressing domain in which 6rd is\
    \ used.\n   Knowing it, gateways and CPEs could avoid including this constant\n\
    \   IPv4 prefix in IPv6 prefixes, and thus reduce to 24 the number of\n   bits\
    \ of IPv4 addresses that are included in IPv6 prefixes (but this\n   was not applicable\
    \ to Free).\n   It can also be noted that, if an ISP is large enough to provide\n\
    \   service to more IPv4 endpoints than will fit inside a single\n   10.0.0.0/8\
    \ addressing domain, it can configure several such domains,\n   with 6rd-relay\
    \ IPv6 prefixes specific of each one.  Each of these\n   prefixes is then the\
    \ RIR-allocated ISP prefix followed by a domain\n   identifier chosen by the ISP.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations for 6to4 are documented\
    \ in [RFC3964].  With\n   the restriction imposed by 6rd that relays of an ISP\
    \ deal only with\n   traffic that belongs to that ISP, checks that have to be\
    \ done become\n   the following:\n   o  CPE PACKETS TOWARD THE INTERNET: The IPv6\
    \ source must be, and the\n      IPv6 destination must not be, a 6rd address of\
    \ the site.\n   o  RELAY PACKETS TOWARD THE INTERNET: The IPv6 source must be\
    \ a 6rd\n      address that matches the IPv4 source.  The IPv6 destination must\n\
    \      not start with the ISP 6rd prefix.\n   o  CPE PACKETS FROM THE INTERNET:\
    \ If the IPv4 source is the 6rd-\n      relay's anycast address of the local ISP,\
    \ the IPv6 source must not\n      be a 6rd address of this ISP.  Otherwise, the\
    \ IPv6 source must be\n      the 6rd address that matches the IPv4 source (is\
    \ the IPv6 prefix\n      of 6rd relays of the ISP followed by the IPv4 address).\n\
    \   o  RELAY PACKETS FROM THE INTERNET: The IPv6 source must not be a 6rd\n  \
    \    address of the ISP.  The IPv4 destination must not be multicast,\n      i.e.,\
    \ must not start with 224/3.  The fact that the IPv6\n      destination starts\
    \ with the IPv6 prefix of the ISP 6rd relays is\n      ensured by the routing\
    \ configuration, but may be double-checked.\n   It remains that where IPv4 address\
    \ spoofing is possible (IPv4 sites\n   placing unauthorized source addresses in\
    \ some packets they send),\n   IPv6 address spoofing is also possible, independently\
    \ of the above\n   precautions.\n"

  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   ISPs that provide CPEs to all their customers need\
    \ no new number\n   assignment by IANA.  Their being allocated an IPv6 prefix\

    \ in the future by ISPs that let customers have\n   their own CPEs, means to communicate\
    \ 6rd parameters to these CPEs\n   would be needed.  If the IETF specifies such\

    \   Acknowledgments are also due to some IPv6 old timers, in particular\n   Laurent\
    \ Toutain, Francis Dupont, and Alain Durand, who, when the\n   author came as\
    \ a late novice on IPV6, taught him a few subtleties of\n   the subject.  Without\
    \ them, designing 6rd would probably not have\n   been possible.\n"
