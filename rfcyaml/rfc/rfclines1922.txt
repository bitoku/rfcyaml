Abstract This memo describes methods of transporting Chinese characters in Internet services which transport text, such as electronic mail [RFC 822], network news [RFC 1036], telnet [RFC 854] and the World Wide Web [RFC 1866].
As the use of Internet covers more and more Chinese people in the world, the need has increased for the ability to send documents containing Chinese characters on the Internet.
The methods described in this document provide means of transporting existing Chinese character sets as well as leaving space for future extension.
This document describes two encodings, ISO 2022 CN and ISO 2022 CN EXT.
These are designed with interoperability in mind and are encouraged in this document for current Chinese interchange; they are 7 bit, support both simplified and traditional characters using both GB and CNS/Big5, and do not impose any unusual quoting requirements on ASCII characters.
As important related issues, this document gives detailed descriptions of the two encodings CN GB and CN Big5, and a brief description of ISO/IEC 10646 [ISO 10646].
CN GB and CN Big5 are currently used as the internal codes for Chinese documents.
ISO 10646 is the universal multi octet character set defined by ISO; we feel that in the future it may become the preferred technology for Chinese documents and electronic mail when it is widely available.
ISO 2022 CN and ISO 2022 CN EXT 1.1.
Description ISO 2022 CN is based on ISO 2022 [ISO 2022], similar to earlier work on ISO 2022 JP [RFC 1468] and ISO 2022 KR [RFC 1557] for the Japanese and Korean languages respectively.
It is 7 bit, and supports both simplified Chinese characters using GB 2312 80 [GB 2312] and traditional Chinese characters using the first two planes of CNS 11643 [CNS 11643], as well as ASCII [ASCII] characters.
ISO 2022 CN EXT is a superset of ISO 2022 CN that additionally supports other GB character sets and planes of CNS 11643.
Since ISO 2022 CN and ISO 2022 CN EXT are 7 bit encodings, they do not require the 8 bit SMTP extensions.
ISO 2022 CN supports all the Chinese characters that appear in Big5 [BIG5].
The starting code of ISO 2022 CN is ASCII.
ASCII and Chinese characters are distinguished by designations (ESC sequences) and shift functions.
Designations define the Chinese character sets used in the text.
There are three kinds of designations: SOdesignation, SS2designation and SS3designation.
The SOdesignation is in the form ESC $ )
<F>, where <F> is the "final character" assigned to the character set by ISO (refer to the ISO registry [ISOREG] for more details).
A designation overrides any previous designation for subsequent bytes in the text.
There are four kinds of shifts: SI, SO, SS2 and SS3.
Shift functions specify how to interpret the subsequent bytes.
The shift SI (one byte with hexadecimal value 0F) declares that subsequent bytes are interpreted in ASCII.
The shift SO (one byte with hexadecimal value 0E) declares that subsequent bytes are interpreted in the character set defined by SOdesignation.
The shift SS2 (two bytes with hexadecimal values 1B 4E) declares that the subsequent TWO bytes are interpreted in the character set defined by SS2designation, after which the previous interpretation (from SI or SO) is restored.
The shift SS3 (two bytes with hexadecimal values 1B 4F) declares that the subsequent TWO bytes are interpreted in the character set defined by SS3designation, after which the previous interpretation (from SI or SO) is restored.
The escape sequences, shift functions and character sets used in an ISO 2022 CN text are as follows:
Also, there must be a shift to ASCII (SI) before the end of the line (i.e., before the CRLF).
In other words, each line starts in ASCII, and ends in ASCII.
Example: the hex sequence 1b 24 29 41
0e 3d 3b 3b 3b 1b 24
29 47 47 28 5f 50 0f represents the Chinese word for "Interchange" (jiao huan) twice;
the first time in simplified form using GB 2312 (the 3d 3b 3b 3b sequence above), and the second time in traditional form using CNS 11643 (the 47 28 5f 50 sequence above).
The sequence 1b 24 29 41 is the SOdesignation for GB 2312, the 0e is SO to switch to Chinese from ASCII, the 1b 24 29 47 is the SOdesignation for CNS 11643 plane 1, and finally the 0f is the SI to return to ASCII at the end of the line.
The name given to this character encoding is "ISO 2022 CN".
This name is intended to be used as the "charset" parameter in MIME [MIME 1, MIME 2] messages.
; charset iso 2022 cn
The ISO 2022 CN encoding is already in 7 bit form, so it is not necessary to use a Content Transfer Encoding header.
Other restrictions are given in the "Formal Syntax of ISO 2022 CN" (Section 7.1 of this document).
ISO 2022 CN EXT ISO 2022 CN EXT supports all characters in existing GB, Big5 and CNS 11643 character sets.
The escape sequences, shift functions and character sets used in an ISO 2022 CN EXT text are as follows:
Currently, there are some GB sets that have not been registered in ISO.
<X13131> and <X13132> represent the final character that will be assigned by ISO for those sets.
These GB sets shall only be used once these final characters are assigned.
Indicates the two bytes immediately following SS2 is a Chinese character as defined in GB 7589 87 [GB 7589], until another SS2designation appears ESC $
Indicates the two bytes immediately following SS3 is a Chinese character as defined in GB 7590 87 [GB 7590], until another SS3designation appears ESC $ )
Indicates the bytes following SO are as defined in GB 12345
90 [GB 12345], until another SOdesignation appears ESC $
Indicates the two bytes immediately following SS2 is a Chinese character as defined in GB 13131 91 [GB 13131], until another SS2designation appears ESC $
Indicates the two bytes immediately following SS3 is a Chinese character as defined in GB 13132 91 [GB 13131], until another SS3designation appears ESC $ )
The name given to this character encoding is "ISO 2022 CN EXT".
This name is intended to be used as the "charset" parameter in MIME messages.
Content Type: text/plain; charset ISO 2022 CN EXT
The ISO 2022 CN EXT encoding is also in 7 bit form, so it is not necessary to use a Content Transfer Encoding header.
Other restrictions are given in the "Formal Syntax of ISO 2022 CN EXT" (Section 7.2 of this document).
How to Support Big5 or other internal codesets with ISO 2022 CN and ISO 2022 CN EXT Since there are many different Chinese internal coding systems [CJKINF], such as EUC GB, Big5, CCCII (an encoding for library systems mainly used in Taiwan), GBK (the new standard specification for Chinese internal code, also is the codepage for Microsoft simplified Chinese Windows 95) etc.
, ISO 2022 CN and ISO 2022 CN EXT, which are 7 bit and will not lose information during communication among different codesets,  facilitate interchange between the various Chinese coding systems in the Internet.
For instance, ISO 2022 CN and ISO 2022 CN EXT can be used to support the popular Big5 codeset, because the first two planes of CNS 11643 contain the same Chinese characters as Big5's "common part" except two duplicate characters.
" we mean the part that is not specific to any Big5 vendor, consisting of 5401 more frequently used characters in Big5 range 0xA440 0xC67E, 7652 less frequently used characters in Big5 range 0xC940 0xF9D5, and 441 other symbols in Big5 range 0xA140 0xA3E0, as defined in Institute for Information Industry's (III) technical report C 26
The appendix of this document presents a conversion table for converting Big5 into CNS 11643, including specific extensions of some popular vendors.
For other extensions, vendors and implementors of Big5 products are ENCOURAGED to create detailed conversion tables, in order to increase interoperability between different coding systems.
Public domain software (binary or C source code) for conversion between Big5 and CNS 11643 is available on many Internet sites.
At the time of this writing, the following FTP sites and software are advertised:
8 bit Chinese encodings: CN GB and CN Big5
The CN GB and CN Big5 MIME charsets are defined below.
Note: the use of 8 bit character sets requires the use of either an 8 to 7 Content Transfer Encoding mechanism such as "BASE64" or "QUOTED PRINTABLE" if the network is not 8 bit clean, or the 8 bit SMTP extensions [SMTPEXT] with the "8BIT" Content Transfer Encoding on 8 bit clean networks.
Otherwise, an 8 bit message that passes through a 7 bit mailer is likely to have the 8th bit truncated, resulting in an unreadable message.
Although "just send 8 bit data" has been common practice in the past, it is incorrect according to the Internet standards and causes interoperability problems.
CN GB E mail using CN GB characters is sent in this way: GB 2312 80 characters are used with ASCII characters, not GB 1988 89
GB 2312 80 is also 7 bit, to avoid conflicting with ASCII.
If the character is from GB 2312 80, the MSB (bit 8) of each byte is set to 1, and therefore becomes a 8 bit character.
Otherwise, the byte is interpreted as ASCII.
This constructs a character set named "GB Internal Code".
This method is also adopted in the .gb files in the Internet.
To use this character scheme with MIME, CN GB is used as the value for the charset parameter:
Content Type: text/plain; charset cn gb; charset edition 1980
Note: The "charset edition" is a new MIME parameter described in section 4.1 of the "Specification" part of this document.
GB 12345 90 is the traditional form of GB 2312, the charset name given to this set is CN GB 12345 with the charset edition of 1990.
There are also character sets that can only be used with other GB sets.
For example, GB 8565 88 [GB 8565] is used with GB 2312 and some other characters to form the ISO IR 165 set (also known as GB 2312   GB 8565.2).
ISO IR 165 contains all characters from GB 2312 80 as revised by GB 6345.1 86 and GB 8565.2 88.
Its MIME charset name is CN GB ISOIR165 with the charset edition of 1992.
CN GB 12345 and CN GB ISOIR165 support ASCII in a similar manner to CN GB; the MSB of Chinese characters is set to 1 to distinguish from ASCII.
Note: There are some supplementary character sets in GB, i.e.  GB 7589 87, GB 7590 87, GB 13131 91 and GB 13132 91.
Normally, they won't be used independently without using GB 2312 or GB 12345, so they are not necessarily to be registered.
Characters in these standards could be supported with ISO 2022 CN and ISO 2022 CN EXT.
If, in the future, they need to be used with "charset" names, it is the responsibility of any interested third party (the standardization organization or anybody else) to write the necessary documents and register the charset with the IANA.
It is encouraged that the charset names take the form of CN GB <number>, such as CN GB 12345, where <number
> is the GB standard number.
A charset edition should also be given.
All CN GB <number> sets should be coded in 8 bit in a similar fashion to CN GB.
To ensure interoperability, the CN GB charset should be used whenever possible instead of a CN GB <number> charset.
CN Big5 Big5 is a two byte character set of traditional Chinese characters, widely used in Taiwan and overseas.
E mail of CN Big5 is sent in this way: Big5 is used with ASCII.
The MSB of ASCII characters is always 0.
The MSB of the first byte of a Big5 character is always 1; this distinguishes it from an ASCII character.
The second byte has 8 significant bits.
Therefore, CN Big5 is an 8 bit encoding with a 15 bit codespace.
To use this character scheme with MIME, CN Big5 is used as the value for the charset parameter: Content Type: text/plain; charset cn big5; charset edition 1984
Note: The "charset edition" is a new MIME parameter described in section 4.1 of the "Specification" part of this document.
Universal Multilingual Character Set:  ISO/IEC 10646/
Unicode ISO/IEC 10646 defines a 32bit character space with the intent to encode all characters in the world.
Currently, only the lowest 16bit plane of ISO 10646, the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), is defined.
The BMP is code by code identical to Unicode
it contains a large repertoire of Chinese characters (it currently includes all the characters of GB 2312 80, GB 12345 90, GB 8565 89, CNS 11643's plane 1 and 2, and part of some other standards) and therefore can be used to transport Chinese characters in the Internet community.
This document does not give any details on how to do this, as this has been done elsewhere.
For details of using Unicode with MIME, refer to RFC 1641 [RFC 1641], RFC 1642 [RFC 1642].
For assigned names for 10646 set, refer to STD 2 "Assigned Numbers", which is RFC 1700 [RFC 1700] currently.
For more up to date assigned numbers, please check:
Here we define two new MIME parameters to be used with "charset" parameters.
This parameter is used after the MIME "charset" parameter, using four digits (AD) to indicate what the year of edition is for the character set standard shown in "charset".
Implementations should ignore this parameter unless the implementation has specific support for that particular character set edition.
The reason for defining this parameter is that there are often differences in the defined characters between editions of a character set standard.
Sometimes, the difference can not be ignored, otherwise implementations would have problems when processing it.
There are only two ways to indicate this difference, in the current MIME syntax.
One way is to indicate the edition in the charset name, such as CN GB 1988 80 (the 1980's edition of GB 1988).
The other way is to define a new optional parameter such as "charset edition".
The latter way is better because receiving applications that can only process an older edition can still recognize the character set and offer to display the text in the older edition.
This display may have a few mistakes, but it is better than refusing to display any text at all or defaulting to an inappropriate character set such as US ASCII or ISO 8859 1.
This parameter is also used after the MIME "charset" parameter.
It is case insensitive and optional, and any value of this parameter should be registered in IANA.
Unregistered value should start with "x " as with any MIME extension token.
Implementations should ignore this parameter unless the implementation has specific support for that particular character set extension.
A character set extension has displayed glyphs for code points that are not assigned in the character set, for example, vendor specific extensions of standard character sets.
This parameter provides the option of using these extensions.
Although character set extensions may cause interoperability problems, we recognize the existence of such extensions.
For example: Content Type: text/plain; charset CN Big5; charset edition 1984; charset extension ETen 2.00.03 DOS
This may indicate Eten company's extension of Big5: ETen 2.00.03 for DOS, assuming that "ETen 2.00.03 DOS" is registered with the IANA.. 4.3.
Writing systems and their encodings in Chinese speaking nations and regions
The mainland provinces of China use simplified Chinese character in daily life.
GB is the standard electronic character set.
It is the main means for communications between people who share simplified Chinese characters in the world.
Taiwan uses traditional Chinese characters in daily life.
CNS 11643 is the formal character set for information interchange in Taiwan; however, Big5, a widely used character set of traditional Chinese characters, is the de facto internal code standard in Taiwan.
Hong Kong uses traditional Chinese characters in daily life, but uses both GB and Big5 in electronic form, because Hong Kong people often communicate with people in all of China's provinces.
Singapore seldom uses Chinese characters, and uses the simplified form when Chinese characters are used.
In electronic form, Unicode is more popular, however GB is also used.
Miscellaneous information about Chinese character sets The GB 1988 89 character set is identical to ISO 646
[ISO 646] except for currency symbol and tilde.
The currency symbol and the tilde are replaced by the Yuan sign and the overline.
This set is GB's variant of ISO 646.
This character set and CNS 5205
[CNS 5205] are not encouraged for use in the Internet, since ASCII combined with GB 2312 or CNS 11643 plane 1 and plane 2 contains all the characters in them.
The GB 2312 80 character set consists of simplified Chinese characters, digits, and the Latin, Greek and Russian alphabets, and some other symbols; in all, 7445 characters.
Each character is represented with two bytes.
GB 13000 95 [GB 13000] is GB's variant of ISO 10646.
However, for interoperability in the Internet, assigned names for ISO 10646 are encouraged instead.
Currently both sides of the Taiwan Straits are cooperating closely in promoting the use of ISO 10646's BMP and in continuing its development together with other organizations under ISO. 5.3.
Miscellaneous implementation information For maximum interoperability
, implementations SHOULD at least support sending and receiving ISO 2022 CN.
Supporting all registered character sets in ISO 2022 CN EXT is greatly encouraged.
To meet the current usage, support of CN GB (the status quo for simplified Chinese e mail ) or CN Big5 (the status quo for traditional Chinese e mail) may be necessary.
However, it is not reliable to send documents directly with these internal codes, therefore sending ISO 2022 CN message is always encouraged whenever possible.
To the maximum extent possible, implementations should be capable of receiving messages in any of the encodings described in this document, even if they only transmit messages in one form.
Preferably the implementation should display the characters with glyphs appropriate to the typographic tradition that is implied in the encoding of the received text.
Implementation may also translate these encodings to the encoding that its platform supports.
Each Chinese character takes up two columns, and the shift sequences do not take up any columns.
The implementor is reminded that Chinese characters take up two bytes and should not be split in the middle to break lines for displaying, etc.
Freely available fonts of Chinese characters:
X.400 Considerations X.400 has the ability of carrying different character sets in a message by using the body part "GeneralText" defined by ISO/IEC 10021 7
The X.400 ASN.1 definition of the GeneralText body part is: general text body part EXTENDED BODY PART TYPE PARAMETERS GeneralTextParameters IDENTIFIED BY
id ep general text DATA
GeneralString Therefore, to use ISO 2022 CN, set the "CharacterSetRegistration" part as { 6 58 171 172 }, and add an ESC sequence of ESC ( B (three bytes, hexadecimal values: 1B 28 42) before the beginning of each line of ISO 2022 CN text.
Similarly, to use ISO 2022 CN EXT, set the registered numbers of all character sets in the "CharacterSetRegistration" part and add ESC ( B at the beginning of each line.
For the registered numbers, please refer to ISO registry.
187 176 is the registered number for the BASESET of ISO/IEC 10646 1:1993
For CN GB and CN Big5 character sets, there are no formal methods that could be used in X.400 yet.
For detail about X.400 use of character sets, please refer to RFC 1502 [RFC 1502].
