Abstract This memo reclassifies RFC 1142, "OSI IS IS Intra domain Routing Protocol", to Historic status.
This memo also obsoletes RFC 1142.
Introduction IS IS is the "OSI Intermediate system to Intermediate system intra  domain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless mode Network Service (ISO 8473)", otherwise known as ISO/IEC 10589.
It has been extended for use with IP by RFC 1195
[RFC1195] and subsequently enhanced by many other RFCs.
[RFC1142] was a republication of ISO DP 10589 originally provided as a service to the Internet community.
However, ISO DP 10589 was an ISO "Draft Proposal", which differed in a considerable number of significant respects from the final standardized version published as ISO/IEC 10589
[ISO10589 First Edition], and subsequently revised as ISO/IEC 10589 Second Edition [ISO10589 Second Edition].
It has been an ongoing source of confusion when RFC 1142 has been unwittingly quoted or referenced in place of ISO/IEC 10589 itself.
All references to IS IS should be to the latest edition of the IS IS standard (currently ISO/IEC 10589:2002, Second Edition), and RFC 1142 is only of historic interest.
This memo explains why RFC 1142, "OSI IS IS Intra domain Routing Protocol", is reclassified to Historic status.
This memo also obsoletes RFC 1142.
Security Considerations Reclassifying RFC 1142 has no security considerations.
