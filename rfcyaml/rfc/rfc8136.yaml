- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In a recent statement [IABv6], the Internet Architecture\
    \ Board deemed\n   that the Internet Engineering Task Force is expected to \"\
    stop\n   requiring IPv4 compatibility in new or extended protocols\" and that\n\
    \   future work will \"optimize for and depend on IPv6\".  In the interest\n \
    \  of promoting these goals, this memo makes an important change to IPv4\n   node\
    \ requirements [RFC1122] and adds a missing security feature to\n   IPv6 [RFC2460].\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT\
    \ RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are not to be\
    \ interpreted as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Required Function of All IPv4 Nodes
  contents:
  - "2.  Required Function of All IPv4 Nodes\n   To ensure that all routers, firewalls,\
    \ load balancers, and other\n   forms of middleboxes can readily identify IPv4\
    \ packets and deal with\n   them appropriately (selective dropping, switching\
    \ to the slow path\n   through a router, sending them to the longest path first,\
    \ etc.), all\n   IPv4 nodes MUST set the security flag defined by [RFC3514] to\
    \ 1.\n   This should be sufficient to ensure that implementers of dual stack\n\
    \   applications prefer IPv6 when given the choice, and that the Happy\n   Eyeballs\
    \ algorithm [RFC6555] will usually favour the IPv6 path.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Flag for IPv6 Packets
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Flag for IPv6 Packets\n   The above requirement will somewhat nullify\
    \ the practical effect of\n   the IPv4 security flag for benign traffic, but this\
    \ disadvantage can\n   readily be overcome by adding an equivalent flag for IPv6;\
    \ in fact,\n   this is highly desirable to maintain feature equivalence between\
    \ IPv4\n   and IPv6.  Fortunately, this can easily be achieved since IPv6\n  \
    \ supplies so many bits.  The solution defined here is that the\n   Security Flag\
    \ bit for an IPv6 packet is simply the parity of the\n   source address of the\
    \ packet.  In other words, if the source address\n   contains an odd number of\
    \ 1s, the flag is True; otherwise, it's\n   False.  All other considerations for\
    \ the flag are exactly as\n   described in [RFC3514].\n   For an interface whose\
    \ IPv6 address is set by Stateless Address\n   Autoconfiguration [RFC4862], it\
    \ is the host itself that determines\n   the state of its security flag, by choosing\
    \ an appropriate Interface\n   Identifier value.  Fortunately this is now possible\
    \ and compatible\n   with [RFC7136], [RFC7217], [RFC7421], and [RFC7721].\n  \
    \ For an interface whose IPv6 address is set by DHCPv6 [RFC3315] or\n   manually,\
    \ the network administrator is free to choose an Interface\n   Identifier that\
    \ provides the desired security flag that is also\n   compatible with [RFC7721].\n\
    \   An exception case is a link with a 127-bit prefix [RFC6164].  Since\n   there\
    \ is only one bit available as an Interface Identifier, one end\n   or the other\
    \ will inevitably have its security flag set, and the\n   other won't.  In this\
    \ case, the node at one end will simply interpret\n   the other end's security\
    \ flag to mean the opposite of what it says,\n   and vice versa.\n   Since RFC\
    \ 6164 is designed for links between routers, in the case\n   where different\
    \ ISPs are at each end of the link, it is normal\n   operational practice for\
    \ one ISP to consider the other ISP to be\n   evil.\n"
- title: 4.  Advanced Solution
  contents:
  - "4.  Advanced Solution\n   In the event that the previous solution proves too\
    \ simple to deploy\n   in practice, a more advanced solution is also defined.\
    \  It uses a new\n   IPv6 hop-by-hop User Security Flag Option (UFO).\n   The\
    \ UFO is a hop-by-hop option that can be included in any IPv6\n   packet.  Multiple\
    \ UFOs MUST NOT be present in the packet.  The UFO\n   has no alignment requirement.\
    \  Its format is as follows:\n     0                   1                   2 \

    \ 8-bit unsigned integer.  Bit 0 has the functionality defined in\n        [RFC3514].\
    \  The other bits are reserved and MUST be zero or one.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Privacy Extension
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Privacy Extension\n   The mechanism can be extended to add a privacy flag.\
    \  With the\n   mechanism of Section 3, the privacy flag could be encoded by using\n\
    \   quaternary parity (CRC-2) to obtain an extra bit.  However, this\n   would\
    \ waste considerable amounts of address space and SHOULD NOT be\n   done.  With\
    \ the UFO mechanism, bit 1 of UserSecFlag is defined as the\n   privacy flag.\
    \  If set, it means that the packet contains private\n   information and MUST\
    \ NOT be inspected en route.  All firewalls,\n   monitoring devices, and government\
    \ agencies MUST respect this rule.\n   This option is expected to be much more\
    \ computationally efficient\n   than conventional privacy techniques like IPsec\
    \ and Transport Layer\n   Security (TLS) as no encryption or key management is\
    \ required to\n   achieve the desired privacy.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC3514] now\
    \ apply to IPv6.  However,\n   with the security flag being set for all IPv4 packets,\
    \ there is a\n   risk that all IPv4 traffic will now be treated as a very distributed\n\
    \   denial-of-service attack.\n   Given the recent experience with very large\
    \ scale DDoS attacks from\n   Internet of Things (IoT) devices like IP Cameras,\
    \ phishing attacks,\n   malware, etc., that occur on the IPv4 Internet, it is\
    \ a safe\n   assumption that all IPv4 packets are evil.\n   Since the mechanism\
    \ described in Section 3 is compatible with\n   [RFC7721], address privacy is\
    \ not impacted.  Also, with that\n   mechanism, exactly half the IPv6 address\
    \ space will indicate that the\n   security flag is set, so we can assert that\
    \ the IPv6 Internet is only\n   half evil.\n"
