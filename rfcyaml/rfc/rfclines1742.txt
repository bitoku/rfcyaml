Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing AppleTalk networks.
RFC 1243 defines a set of MIB objects for managing the lower layers of the AppleTalk protocol stack, up to the Network layer.
This memo defines additional objects that exist in the AppleTalk portion of the MIB.
These objects provide for the management of the transport and session layers of the AppleTalk protocol stack, as well as extensions to the lower layers.
This is achieved in an upwardly compatable fashion.
The Internet standard Network Management Framework consists of three components.
They are: STD 16/RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
STD 16/RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.
RFC 1156 which defines MIB I, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
STD 17/RFC 1213 defines MIB  II, an evolution of MIB
I based on implementation experience and new operational requirements.
STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
This MIB includes additions and changes to RFC 1243.
These changes are outlined in the following sections.
The following groups are introduced in this MIB: DDP Router RTMP
ZIP Router ATP PAP ASP ADSP ATPortPtoP Per Port Counters 2.2.
Many variables, mostly counters, were added to groups that existed in RFC 1243.
These variables are listed in the following sections.
atportHome atportCurrentZone atportConflictPhysAddr atportZoneTable 2.2.3.
RTMP Additions rtmpInDataPkts rtmpOutDataPkts rtmpInRequestPkts rtmpNextIREqualChanges rtmpNextIRLessChanges
ZIP Additions zipNetInfoTable zipInErrors 2.2.7.
NBP Additions nbpAddress nbpSocket nbpEnumerator nbpInLookUpRequests
The following variables have been deprecated in this version of the MIB: llapInPkts llapOutPkts llapInNoHandlers llapInErrors These llap variables were duplicated in the interfaces table of MIB  II.
The IMPORTS list has been updated to reflect the current SNMP documents.
New textual conventions have been defined.
Hyphens have been removed from enumeration strings.
Variables used as INDEXes to new tables have ACCESS not accessible.
This is because the values of the INDEX variables are contained in the object identifier for any of the other variables in the table; therefore, it does not need to be explicitly available as data.
The atportNetConfig and atportZoneConfig variables have been changed from read only to read write.
The atportZone variable has be renamed to atportZoneDefault, and its DESCRIPTION clause has been clarified.
The atportType, atportStatus, and kipType variables have had more values added to their enumeration lists.
The DDP group has been split into two groups; one includes variables that any AppleTalk node would implement and the other includes variables only a router would implement.
The rtmpState variable now includes another enumeration, invalid(5), which is used when deleting rows.
The variables rtmpRangeStart, rtmpRangeEnd, rtmpNextHop, rtmpType, rtmpPort, and rtmpHops have been changed from read write to read  only.
The ZIP Group has been renamed the ZIP End Node Group.
The DESCRIPTION clause for zipZoneIndex has been clarified.
The variables zipZoneName, zipZoneNetStart, and zipZoneNetEnd have been changed from read write to read only.
The nbpIndex variable has been changed from read only to read write.
The nbpObject, nbpType, and nbpZone variables now suggest that the agent reregister its service when any of these variables is changed.
The nbpState variable includes new enumerations.
Objects Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
[7] defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.
The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.
The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure corresponding to that object type.
The ASN.1 language is used for this purpose.
However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is represented using the object type's syntax.
Implicitly tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding
is how the object type is represented when being transmitted on the network.
The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.
Format of Definitions Section 5 contains the specification of all object types contained in this MIB module.
The object types are defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [9].
Overview AppleTalk is a protocol suite which features an open peer to peer architecture that runs over a variety of transmission media.
AppleTalk is defined in [10].
This protocol suite interoperates with the IP protocol suite through various encapsulation methods.
As large AppleTalk networks are built that coexist with large IP networks, a method to manage the AppleTalk networks with SNMP becomes necessary.
This MIB defines managed objects to be used for managing AppleTalk networks.
The objects are arranged into the following groups:
Stub KIP ZIP Router ZIP End Node NBP ATEcho ATP PAP ASP ADSP ATPortPtoP Per Port Counters
These groups are the basic unit of conformance.
If the semantics of a group is applicable to an implementation, then it must implement all objects in that group.
For example, a managed agent must implement the KIP group if and only if it implements the KIP protocol.
These groups are defined to provide a method for managed agents to know which objects they must implement.
The LocalTalk Link Access Protocol Group
The LocalTalk Link Access Protocol (LLAP) is a medium speed data link protocol designed for low cost and plug and play operation.
The LLAP group is designed to manage all interfaces on a managed device that use this protocol.
The AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol Group
The AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol (AARP) is used to map between AppleTalk node addresses, used by the Datagram Delivery Protocol, and the addresses of the underlying data link layer.
The AARP table allows for management of the Address Mapping Table on the managed device.
An AppleTalk Port is a logical connection to a network over which AppleTalk packets can be transmitted.
The "network" could be a tunnel, backbone network, point to point link, etc, as well as a native AppleTalk network.
This group allows the management of the configuration of these AppleTalk ports.
The Datagram Delivery Protocol Group
The Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP) is the network layer protocol that is responsible for the socket to socket delivery of datagrams over the AppleTalk Internet.
This group manages the DDP layer on the managed device.
The DDP group contains statistical counters for the DDP protocol, and a table describing the DDP sockets that have protocol handlers registered.
The Datagram Delivery Protocol Router Group
Some variables relevant to the Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP) are only applicable to AppleTalk routers.
These variables are included in this group.
The Routing Table Maintenance Protocol Group The Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP) is used by AppleTalk routers to create and maintain the routing tables that dictate the process of forwarding datagrams on the AppleTalk internet.
The RTMP group manages the RTMP protocol as well as the routing tables generated by this protocol.
The Routing Table Maintenance Protocol Stub Group
The RTMP Stub process is implemented by end nodes in order to maintain information about the routers on their networks.
The variables in this group apply to both routers and end nodes.
This group manages the RTMP stub process.
The Kinetics Internet Protocol Group
The Kinetics Internet Protocol (KIP) is a protocol for encapsulating and routing AppleTalk datagrams over an IP internet.
The KIP group manages the KIP routing protocol as well as the routing tables generated by this protocol.
The Zone Information Protocol Router Group
The Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) is used to maintain a mapping between networks and zone names to facilitate the name lookup process performed by the Name Binding Protocol.
Some variables relevant to the Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) are only applicable to AppleTalk routers.
These variables are included in this group.
The Zone Information Protocol End Node Group
The ZIP End Node group manages the variables relevant to the Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) that are applicable to both routers and end nodes.
The Name Binding Protocol Group
The Name Binding Protocol (NBP) is a transport level protocol that is used to convert human readable service names into the numeric AppleTalk network addresses needed for communicating across the AppleTalk network.
The NBP group manages this protocol and the NBP services that exist on the managed device.
The AppleTalk Echo Protocol Group
The AppleTalk Echo Protocol is a transport level protocol used to test and verify the status of the AppleTalk internet.
The AtEcho group manages this protocol.
The AppleTalk Transaction Protocol Group
The AppleTalk Transaction Protocol (ATP) is a transport level protocol that is defined to support transaction based communications.
The ATP group manages this protocol.
The Printer Access Protocol Group
The Printer Access Protocol (PAP) is a session level protocol that enables communications between workstations and print servers.
The PAP group manages this protocol.
The AppleTalk Session Protocol Group
The AppleTalk Session Protocol (ASP) is a session level protocol that enables sequences of communications to occur.
ASP uses the services of the AppleTalk Transaction Protocol (ATP), but extends these services into the session layer.
The ASP group manages this protocol.
The AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol Group
The AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol (ADSP) is a session level protocol that provides symmetric, connection oriented, full duplex communication between two sockets on the AppleTalk internet.
In addition, ADSP handles flow control and reliability.
The ADSP group manages this protocol.
The AppleTalk Port Point to Point Group
The AppleTalk Port Point to Point Group manages ports that have one or more associated point to point connections.
The Per Port Counters Group
The Per Port Counters Group contains a set of counters which are deemed useful on a per port basis.
Textual Conventions New data types are introduced as textual conventions in this MIB document.
These textual conventions enhance the readability of the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if appropriate.
It should be noted that the introduction of these textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax or the semantics of any managed objects.
The use of this is merely an artifact of the explanatory method used.
Objects defined in terms of this method are always encoded by means of the rules that define the primitive type.
Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

When atportNetConfig is set to garnered(2), this variable contains the DDP address of an entity from which the AppleTalk network number was garnered.
When atportNetConfig is set to conflictOrientedSeed(1), conflictAverseSeed(5), or softSeed(6), this variable contains the DDP address of an entity which confirmed or supplied our AppleTalk network number, for example by replying to a ZIP GetNetInfo request.

If this address is not available, or if the entity has not set atportStatus to offDueToConflict, this object shall be a zero length OCTET STRING."
The default zone for each   port is stored in the port's atportZoneDefault variable;   all other zones for the port are listed in this table.
If a port only has one zone, it should be stored in the   port's atportZoneDefault variable, and this table should   be empty.
One of the indexes for this table is atportZoneName.
Even though AppleTalk zone name matches are   case insensitive, this table will store zone names   regardless of case.
GetNext and Set operations   are performed on these (potentially) mixed case strings   according to the normal SNMP rules with the following   caveat: in processing a SET request, the agent shall   perform a case insensitive search and a case sensitive   search.
If the case insensitive search matches and the   case sensitive search does not match, the "equivalent"   zone name exists in another entry with a different   capitalization and the SET request shall fail due   to the name being inconsistent
(SNMPv1 should return a   genErr.)
This insures that only one version of a zone   name will appear in each agent, at the expense of forcing   a management station to query using that exact name.

The ddpForwardingTable is a read only table which shows the   next hop that a datagram will take when being routed to a   specific network.
If a manager wishes to change data in   this table via SNMP, he must change it in the MIB for the   routing protocol itself (by incrementing hop counts,   etc), rather than in this table.
This table is derived   by the managed entity from the information it receives   from the routing protocols that it supports.
This table also shows the routing table from which the next   hop was derived.
When a MIB is written for an AppleTalk   routing protocol, it should include the definition of an   object identifier which will be used in the   ddpForwardingProto variable defined here.
To look for a specific net N in this table, it is suggested   that the management station perform a get next query for   ddpForwardingNetEnd.(N 1).
This will retrieve the correct   row if it exists in the table.
