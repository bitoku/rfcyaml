  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a format for using compressed data as a\n
    \  Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) content type.  Compressing data\n   before
    transmission provides a number of advantages, including the\n   elimination of
    data redundancy which could help an attacker, speeding\n   up processing by reducing
    the amount of data to be processed by later\n   steps (such as signing or encryption),
    and reducing overall message\n   size.  Although there have been proposals for
    adding compression at\n   other levels (for example at the MIME or SSL level),
    these don't\n   address the problem of compression of CMS content unless the\n
    \  compression is supplied by an external means (for example by\n   intermixing
    MIME and CMS).\n"

    CMS.  This\n   is implemented as a new ContentInfo type and is an extension to
    the\n   types currently defined in CMS [RFC2630].  CMS implementations SHOULD\n
    \  include support for the CompressedData content type.\n   The format of the
    messages are described in ASN.1 [ASN1].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\",\n   \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"

    - "1.1 Compressed Data Content Type\n   The compressed-data content type consists
      of content of any type,\n   compressed using a specified algorithm.  The following
      object\n   identifier identifies the compressed-data content type:\n      id-ct-compressedData
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)\n        us(840) rsadsi(113549)
      pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16) ct(1) 9 }\n   The compressed-data content type shall
      have ASN.1 type\n   CompressedData:\n      CompressedData ::= SEQUENCE {\n        version
      CMSVersion,\n        compressionAlgorithm CompressionAlgorithmIdentifier,\n
      \       encapContentInfo EncapsulatedContentInfo\n        }\n   The fields of
      type CompressedData have the following meanings:\n      version is the syntax
      version number.  It MUST be 0.  Details of\n      the CMSVersion type are discussed
      in CMS [RFC2630], section\n      10.2.5.\n      compressionAlgorithm is a compression
      algorithm identifier, as\n      defined in section 2.\n      encapContentInfo
      is the content which is compressed.  Details of\n      the EncapsulatedContentInfo
      type are discussed in CMS [RFC2630],\n      section 5.2.\n   Implementations
      SHOULD use the SMIMECapabilities attribute to\n   indicate their ability to
      process compressed content types.  Details\n   of SMIMECapabilities are discussed
      in MSG [RFC2633], section 2.5.2.\n   A compression SMIMECapability consists
      of the AlgorithmIdentifier for\n   the supported compression algorithm.  In
      the case of the algorithm\n   specified in this document, this is id-alg-zlibCompression,
      as\n   specified in section 2.  Alternatively, the use of compression may be\n
      \  handled by prior arrangement (for example as part of an\n   interoperability
      profile).\n   The SMIMECapability SEQUENCE representing the ability to process\n
      \  content compressed with the algorithm identified by id-alg-\n   zlibCompression
      MUST be DER-encoded as the following hexadecimal\n   string:\n      30 0D 06
      0B 2A 86 48 86 F7 0D 01 09 10 03 08\n   (but see also the implementation note
      in section 2.1).\n"

  title: 1. Introduction
- contents:
  - "2. Compression Types\n   CMS implementations that support the CompressedData
    content type MUST\n   include support for the ZLIB compression algorithm [RFC1950]\n
    \  [RFC1951], which has a freely-available, portable and efficient\n   reference
    implementation.  The following object identifier identifies\n   ZLIB:\n      id-alg-zlibCompress
    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)\n        us(840) rsadsi(113549)
    pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16) alg(3) 8 }\n   This algorithm has no parameters.  The
    parameters field SHOULD be\n   encoded as omitted, but MAY be encoded as NULL
    (see the\n   implementation note in section 2.1).\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1. Implementation notes\n   ZLIB allows for a number of compression levels
      ranging from good but\n   slow compression, to less good but fast compression.
      \ The compression\n   level is always compatible with the decompression algorithm,
      so there\n   is no need to specify the compression level as an algorithm\n   parameter.\n
      \  There are two possible encodings for the ZLIB null parameters field\n   which
      arise from the fact that when the 1988 syntax for\n   AlgorithmIdentifier was
      translated into the 1997 syntax, the OPTIONAL\n   associated with the AlgorithmIdentifier
      parameters got lost.  Later\n   it was recovered via a defect report, but by
      then, everyone thought\n   that algorithm parameters were mandatory.  Because
      of this, some\n   implementations will encode null parameters as an ASN.1 NULL
      element\n   and some will omit them entirely (see for example section 12 of
      CMS\n   [RFC2630]).  Although the correct encoding is to omit the parameters\n
      \  field, implementations may encounter encodings which use an ASN.1\n   NULL
      element for the parameters.\n"

  - "3. Security Considerations\n   This RFC is not concerned with security, except
    for the fact that\n   compressing data before encryption can enhance the security
    provided\n   by other processing steps by reducing the quantity of known plaintext\n
    \  available to an attacker.  However, implementations should be aware\n   of
    possible security threats of combining security sensitive material\n   with possibly
    untrusted data before the compression and encryption.\n   This is because information
    about the sensitive data may be inferred\n   from knowing the untrusted data and
    the compression ratio.\n"
  title: 3. Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "4. IANA Considerations\n   The CompressedData content type and compression algorithms
    are\n   identified by object identifiers (OIDs).  OIDs were assigned from an\n
    \  arc contributed to the S/MIME Working Group by RSA Security.  Should\n   additional
    compression algorithms be introduced, the advocates for\n   such algorithms are
    expected to assign the necessary OIDs from their\n   own arcs.  No action by the
    IANA is necessary for this document or\n   any anticipated updates.\n"
