- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 5988 [RFC5988] standardized a means of indicating the\n\
    \   relationships between resources on the Web.  This specification\n   defines\
    \ link relation types that may be used to express the\n   relationships between\
    \ a resource and an input form for constructing\n   data submissions.\n   The\
    \ \"create-form\" and \"edit-form\" link relations are intentionally\n   generic,\
    \ and they can be used with multiple media types in a wide\n   variety of use\
    \ cases.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Notational Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\

- title: 3.  Link Relations
  contents:
  - "3.  Link Relations\n   The following link relations are defined.\n"
- title: 3.1.  The "create-form" Link Relation Type
  contents:
  - "3.1.  The \"create-form\" Link Relation Type\n   When included in a response,\
    \ the \"create-form\" link relation\n   indicates a target resource that represents\
    \ a form that can be used\n   to append a new member to the link context.\n  \
    \ <html>\n     <ul>\n       <li>Entry Description 1</li>\n       <li>Entry Description\
    \ 2</li>\n     </ul>\n     <a href=\"...\" rel=\"create-form\">[Add New Entry]</a>\n\
    \   </html>\n   or, expressed as a Link header\n   Link: <...>; rel=\"create-form\"\
    ; title=\"Add New Entry\"\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Using the "create-form" Link Relation
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Using the \"create-form\" Link Relation\n   If the form representation\
    \ includes a submission URI, this URI MUST\n   be used to submit the form.  The\
    \ context URI SHOULD be used\n   otherwise.\n   If the form representation includes\
    \ a submission method, this method\n   MUST be used for submit requests.  HTTP's\
    \ POST method SHOULD be used\n   otherwise.\n"
- title: 3.2.  The "edit-form" Link Relation Type
  contents:
  - "3.2.  The \"edit-form\" Link Relation Type\n   When included in a response, the\
    \ \"edit-form\" link relation indicates\n   a target resource that represents\
    \ a form that can be used for\n   updating the context resource.\n   <html>\n\
    \    ...\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Entry Description 1\n        <a href=\"\
    ...\" rel=\"edit-form\">[Edit Entry]</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    ...\n  \
    \ </html>\n   or, expressed as a Link header\n   Link: <...>; rel=\"edit-form\"\
    ; title=\"Edit Entry\"\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Using the "edit-form" Link Relation
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Using the \"edit-form\" Link Relation\n   If the form representation\
    \ includes a submission URI, this URI MUST\n   be used to submit the form.  The\
    \ context URI SHOULD be used\n   otherwise.\n   If the form representation includes\
    \ a submission method, this method\n   MUST be used for submit requests.  HTTP's\
    \ PUT method SHOULD be used\n   otherwise.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Error-Handling Example
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Error-Handling Example\n   When submitting forms in unsupported media type\
    \ format, service may\n   respond to the client with HTTP's 415 Unsupported Media\
    \ Type status\n   code.\n     HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type\n     Link:\
    \ <...>; rel=\"create-form\"; title=\"Create new entry\"\n     Content-Type: text/html\n\
    \     Content-Length: ...\n     <html>\n       Use <a href=\"...\" rel=\"create-form\"\
    >\n         this form\n       </a> to create a new entry.\n     </html>\n"

    \   create-form\n   Description:\n      The target IRI points to a resource where\
    \ a submission form can be\n      obtained.\n   Security considerations:\n   \
    \   Automated agents should take care when this relation crosses\n      administrative\
    \ domains (e.g., the URI has a different authority\n      than the current document).\n\
    \   Reference:\n      See Section 3.\n"
- title: 4.2.  The Link Relation Registration "edit-form"
  contents:
  - "4.2.  The Link Relation Registration \"edit-form\"\n   Relation Name:\n     \
    \ edit-form\n   Description:\n      The target IRI points to a resource where\
    \ a submission form for\n      editing the associated resource can be obtained.\n\
    \   Security Considerations:\n      Automated agents should take care when this\
    \ relation crosses\n      administrative domains (e.g., the URI has a different\
