- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n\
    \   In particular, it defines objects for managing ethernet-like\n   interfaces.\n\
    \   This memo also includes a MIB module.  This MIB module extends the\n   list\
    \ of managed objects specified in the earlier version of this MIB:\n   RFC1650\
    \ [11].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"\
    SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"\
    OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [13].\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework\n   The SNMP Network Management Framework\
    \ consists of several components.\n   For the purpose of this specification, the\
    \ applicable components of\n   the Framework are the SMI and related documents\
    \ [2, 3, 4], which\n   define the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects\
    \ for the\n   purpose of management.\n   The Framework permits new objects to\
    \ be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1]\n\
    \   defined in the SMI [2].  In particular, each object object type is\n   named\
    \ by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.\n   The object type\
    \ together with an object instance serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific\
    \ instantiation of the object.  For human\n   convenience, we often use a textual\
    \ string, termed the descriptor, to\n   refer to the object type.\n"
- title: 3.   Overview
  contents:
  - "3.   Overview\n   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an\
    \ interface\n   to an ethernet-like communications medium.  At present, ethernet-like\n\
    \   media are identified by the following values of the ifType object in\n   the\
    \ Interfaces MIB [12]:\n                             ethernetCsmacd(6)\n     \
    \                        iso88023Csmacd(7)\n                                starLan(11)\n\
    \   The definitions presented here are based on the IEEE 802.3 Layer\n   Management\
    \ Specification [5], as originally interpreted by Frank\n   Kastenholz then of\
    \ Interlan in [7].  Implementors of these MIB\n   objects should note that the\
    \ IEEE document explicitly describes (in\n   the form of Pascal pseudocode) when,\
    \ where, and how various MAC\n   attributes are measured.  The IEEE document also\
    \ describes the\n   effects of MAC actions that may be invoked by manipulating\
    \ instances\n   of the MIB objects defined here.\n   To the extent that some of\
    \ the attributes defined in [5] are\n   represented by previously defined objects\
    \ in MIB-2 [16] or in the\n   Interfaces MIB [12], such attributes are not redundantly\
    \ represented\n   by objects defined in this memo.  Among the attributes represented\
    \ by\n   objects defined in other memos are the number of octets transmitted\n\
    \   or received on a particular interface, the number of frames\n   transmitted\
    \ or received on a particular interface, the promiscuous\n   status of an interface,\
    \ the MAC address of an interface, and\n   multicast information associated with\
    \ an interface.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Relation to MIB-2
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Relation to MIB-2\n   This section applies only when this MIB is used in\
    \ conjunction with\n   the \"old\" (RFC 1213) [16] interface group.\n   The relationship\
    \ between an ethernet-like interface and an interface\n   in the context of the\
    \ Internet-standard MIB is one-to-one.  As such,\n   the value of an ifIndex object\
    \ instance can be directly used to\n   identify corresponding instances of the\
    \ objects defined herein.\n   For agents which implement the (now deprecated)\
    \ ifSpecific object, an\n   instance of that object that is associated with an\
    \ ethernet-like\n   interface has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:\n             \
    \ dot3    OBJECT IDENTIFER ::= { transmission 7 }\n"
- title: 3.2.  Relation to the Interfaces MIB
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Relation to the Interfaces MIB\n   The Interface MIB [12] requires that\
    \ any MIB which is an adjunct of\n   the Interface MIB clarify specific areas\
    \ within the Interface MIB.\n   These areas were intentionally left vague in the\
    \ Interface MIB to\n   avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management\
    \ of\n   certain media-types.\n   Section 3.3 of [12] enumerates several areas\
    \ which a media-specific\n   MIB must clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed\
    \ in a following\n   subsection.  The implementor is referred to [12] in order\
    \ to\n   understand the general intent of these areas.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Layering Model
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Layering Model\n   This MIB does not provide for layering.  There are\
    \ no sublayers.\n   EDITOR'S NOTE:\n   One could foresee the development of an\
    \ 802.2 and enet-transceiver\n   MIB.  They could be higher and lower sublayers,\
    \ respectively.  All\n   that THIS document should do is allude to the possibilities\
    \ and urge\n   the implementor to be aware of the possibility and that they may\
    \ have\n   requirements which supersede the requirements in this document.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Virtual Circuits
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Virtual Circuits\n   This medium does not support virtual circuits and\
    \ this area is not\n   applicable to this MIB.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  ifTestTable
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  ifTestTable\n   This MIB defines two tests for media which are instrumented\
    \ with this\n   MIB; TDR and Loopback.  Implementation of these tests is not\n\
    \   required.  Many common interface chips do not support one or both of\n   these\
    \ tests.\n   These two tests are provided as a convenience, allowing a common\n\
    \   method to invoke the test.\n   Standard MIBs do not include objects in which\
    \ to return the results\n   of the TDR test.  Any needed objects MUST be provided\
    \ in the vendor\n   specific MIB.\n   Note that the ifTestTable is now deprecated.\
    \  Work is underway to\n   define a replacement MIB for system and interface testing.\
    \  It is\n   expected that the tests defined in this document will be usable in\n\
    \   this replacement MIB.\n"
- title: 3.2.4.  ifRcvAddressTable
  contents:
  - "3.2.4.  ifRcvAddressTable\n   This table contains all IEEE 802.3 addresses, unicast,\
    \ multicast, and\n   broadcast, for which this interface will receive packets\
    \ and forward\n   them up to a higher layer entity for local consumption.  The\
    \ format\n   of the address, contained in ifRcvAddressAddress, is the same as\
    \ for\n   ifPhysAddress.\n   In the event that the interface is part of a MAC\
    \ bridge, this table\n   does not include unicast addresses which are accepted\
    \ for possible\n   forwarding out some other port.  This table is explicitly not\n\
    \   intended to provide a bridge address filtering mechanism.\n"
- title: 3.2.5.  ifPhysAddress
  contents:
  - "3.2.5.  ifPhysAddress\n   This object contains the IEEE 802.3 address which is\
    \ placed in the\n   source-address field of any Ethernet, Starlan, or IEEE 802.3\
    \ frames\n   that originate at this interface.  Usually this will be kept in ROM\n\
    \   on the interface hardware.  Some systems may set this address via\n   software.\n\
    \   In a system where there are several such addresses the designer has a\n  \
    \ tougher choice.  The address chosen should be the one most likely to\n   be\
    \ of use to network management (e.g.  the address placed in ARP\n   responses\
    \ for systems which are primarily IP systems).\n   If the designer truly can not\
    \ chose, use of the factory- provided ROM\n   address is suggested.\n   If the\
    \ address can not be determined, an octet string of zero length\n   should be\
    \ returned.\n   The address is stored in binary in this object.  The address is\n\
    \   stored in \"canonical\" bit order, that is, the Group Bit is positioned\n\
    \   as the low-order bit of the first octet.  Thus, the first byte of a\n   multicast\
    \ address would have the bit 0x01 set.\n"
- title: 3.2.6.  ifType
  contents:
  - "3.2.6.  ifType\n   This MIB applies to interfaces which have any of the following\
    \ ifType\n   values:\n                             ethernetCsmacd(6)\n       \
    \                      iso88023Csmacd(7)\n                                starLan(11)\n\
    \   It is RECOMMENDED that all Ethernet-like interfaces use an ifType of\n   ethernetCsmacd(6)\
    \ regardless of the speed that the interface is\n   running or the link-layer\
    \ encapsulation in use.  iso88023Csmacd(7)\n   and starLan(11) are supported for\
    \ backwards compatability.\n   There are two other interface types defined in\
    \ the IANAifType-MIB for\n   100 Mbit Ethernet.  They are fastEther(62), and fastEtherFX(69).\n\
    \   This document takes the position that an Ethernet is an Ethernet, and\n  \
    \ Ethernet interfaces SHOULD always have the same value of ifType.\n   Information\
    \ on the particular flavor of Ethernet that an interface is\n   running is available\
    \ from ifSpeed in the Interfaces MIB, and\n   ifMauType in the 802.3 MAU MIB.\
    \  An Ethernet-like interface SHOULD\n   NOT use the fastEther(62) or fastEtherFX(69)\
    \ ifTypes.\n   Interfaces with any of the supported ifType values map to the\n\
    \   EtherLike-MIB in the same manner.  Which compliance statement an\n   interface\
    \ should implement is dependent on the maximum speed\n   supported on the interface.\
    \  The EtherLike-MIB etherCompliance\n   compliance statement applies to all Ethernet-like\
    \ interfaces whose\n   maximum supported speed is 10 Mbit/sec or less.  There\
    \ are no\n   implementation differences. Similarly, the EtherLike-MIB\n   ether100MbsCompliance\
    \ compliance statement applies to all Ethernet-\n   like interfaces whose maximum\
    \ supported speed is 100Mbit/sec.\n   An interface that is capable of operating\
    \ at 100Mbit/sec MUST\n   implement the ether100MbsCompliance compliance statement,\
    \ even if it\n   is currently operating at a lower speed.  Counters in the\n \
    \  ether100MbsCompliance compliance statement that only apply to 100\n   Mbit\
    \ interfaces would simply not increment when the interface is\n   operating at\
    \ a lower speed.\n"

    \ statement of the MAU-MIB\n   [14] is REQUIRED for Ethernet-like interfaces.\
    \  This MIB is needed in\n   order to allow applications to determine the current\

    \ type in\n   use, but also indicates whether the interface is operating in half-\n\

    \ Group.\n   This document is almost completely based on both the Standard\n \
    \  Ethernet MIB, RFC 1643 [10], and the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB\n   using\
    \ the SNMPv2 SMI, RFC 1650 [11], both of which were edited by\n   Frank Kastenholz\
    \ of FTP Software and produced by the Ethernet MIB\n   Working Group.  This document\
    \ extends those documents by providing\n   support for 100 Mb/sec ethernet interfaces\
    \ as outlined in [6].\n   RFC 1643 and RFC 1650, in turn, are based on the Draft\
    \ Standard\n   Ethernet MIB, RFC 1398 [9], also edited by Frank Kastenholz and\n\
    \   produced by the Ethernet MIB Working Group.\n   RFC 1398, in turn, is based\
    \ on the Proposed Standard Ethernet MIB,\n   RFC 1284 [8], which was edited by\
    \ John Cook of Chipcom and produced\n   by the Transmission MIB Working Group.\
    \  The Ethernet MIB Working\n   Group gathered implementation experience of the\
    \ variables specified\n   in RFC 1284 and used that information to develop this\
    \ revised MIB.\n   RFC 1284, in turn, is based on a document written by Frank\n\
    \   Kastenholz, then of Interlan, entitled IEEE 802.3 Layer Management\n   Draft\
    \ M compatible MIB for TCP/IP Networks [7].  This document has\n   been modestly\
    \ reworked, initially by the SNMP Working Group, and then\n   by the Transmission\
    \ Working Group, to reflect the current conventions\n   for defining objects for\
    \ MIB interfaces.  James Davin, of the MIT\n   Laboratory for Computer Science,\
    \ and Keith McCloghrie of Hughes LAN\n   Systems, contributed to later drafts\
    \ of this memo. Marshall Rose of\n   Performance Systems International, Inc. converted\
    \ the document into\n   its current concise format. Anil Rijsinghani of DEC contributed\
    \ text\n   that more adequately describes the TDR test.  Thanks to Frank\n   Kastenholz\

  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are no management objects defined in this\
    \ MIB that have a MAX-\n   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So,\
    \ if this MIB is\n   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder\
    \ can\n   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP\n\
    \   SET operations.\n   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that\
    \ may be\n   considered to contain sensitive information.  In particular, the\n\
    \   dot3StatsEtherChipSet object may be considered sensitive in many\n   environments,\
    \ since it would allow an intruder to obtain information\n   about which vendor's\
    \ equipment is in use on the network.\n   Therefore, it may be important in some\
    \ environments to control read\n   access to these objects and possibly to even\
    \ encrypt the values of\n   these object when sending them over the network via\
    \ SNMP.  Not all\n   versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.\n\
    \   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the\n   network\
    \ itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,\n   there is no control\
    \ as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access and GET (read) the\
    \ objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementors consider the\
    \ security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the\
    \ use\n   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [17] and the View-based\n\
    \   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [18] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user\
    \ responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance\
    \ of this MIB, is properly\n   configured to give access to those objects only\
    \ to those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.\n"

  - "A.  Change Log\n   This section enumerates changes made to RFC 1650 to produce\
    \ this\n   document.\n      (1)   The MODULE-IDENTITY has been updated to reflect\
    \ the changes\n            in the MIB.\n      (2)   A new object, dot3StatsSymbolErrors,\
    \ has been added.\n      (3)   The definition of the object dot3StatsIndex has\
    \ been\n            converted to use the SMIv2 OBJECT-TYPE macro.\n      (4) \
    \  A new conformance group, etherStats100MbsGroup, has been\n            added.\n\
    \      (5)   A new compliance statement, ether100MbsCompliance, has\n        \
