Abstract The Geopriv Location Object introduced by the Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF LO), RFC 4119, defines a basic XML format for carrying geographical information of a presentity.
This document defines PIDF LO extensions to convey information about moving objects.
Elements are defined that enable expression of spatial orientation, speed, and heading of the presentity.
The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF LO)
[RFC4119]) provides geographical location of a presentity.
This corresponds to a physical location at a given instance of time.
[RFC5491] extends PIDF LO and provides additional guidelines to implementers.
This document extends PIDF LO to convey spatial orientation, speed, and heading of a presentity.
The addition of rate of change information to the PIDF LO enables a range of use cases.
These use cases either use dynamic information directly or use that information for smoother tracking of a position over time.
For example, an application that continuously tracks a presentity could use velocity information to extrapolate positions in between times that location information is measured.
A shipping company could directly use speed to monitor delivery truck speed to ensure speed limits are observed.
In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
This document uses the term "presentity", as defined in RFC 2778 [RFC2778], to refer to the device subject to location determination.
The similarity to presence concepts and the abstract location privacy architecture, as described in RFC 4079
[RFC4079], led to re use of the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)
(see RFC 3863 [RFC3863]), and its enhancement for location information (see RFC 4119
Note that this document does not differentiate between human and non human objects, and hence both are in scope.
This document defines a new element, <Dynamic>, for the conveyance of dynamic information.
Dynamic information MAY be included without any other location information being present.
When dynamic information is associated with information about the instantaneous position of the presentity, the <Dynamic> element MUST be included in the same <location info> element as the corresponding geodetic (or civic) location information.
Dynamic information can be safely ignored by a recipient that does not support this specification.
The <Dynamic> element contains the following components:
The <orientation> element describes the spatial orientation of the presentity   the direction that the object is pointing.
For a device, this orientation might depend on the type of device.
See Section 3.1 for details.
speed: Speed is the time rate of change in position of a presentity without regard for direction: the scalar component of velocity.
The value for the <speed> element is a measure that is defined in meters per second.
Heading is the directional component of velocity.
See Section 3.1 for details.
Each element can be omitted if no information is available.
In the following example, the presentity is approximately oriented to the North at a slightly elevated angle.
The presentity is travelling 24 meters per second to the West: <?

Another example shows a PIDF LO document of the presentity alice@example.com on a bike travelling 12 meters per second.
Her position is indicated as a circle.
The values for speed may be used by a receiver to adjust the uncertainty over time.

Angular Measures and Coordinate Reference Systems
[RFC5491] constrains the coordinate reference system (CRS) used in PIDF LO to World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84), using either the two  dimensional (latitude, longitude)
EPSG::4326" or the three dimensional (latitude, longitude, altitude)
Dynamic locations similarly assume that either of these coordinate reference systems will be used.
The <orientation> and <heading> elements both describe a direction.
The <orientation> element describes the "direction of facing"; the <heading> element describes the "direction of travel".
Both measures contain one or two angular values that are expressed relative to the current position of the presentity (see Appendix A).
Angular measures are expressed in degrees, and values can be negative.
If two measures are present, the values MUST be separated by whitespace.
The first measure specifies the horizontal direction from the current position of the presentity to a point that it is pointing towards (for <orientation>) or travelling towards (for <heading>).
Horizontal angles are measured from Northing to Easting.
Horizontal angles start from zero when pointing to or travelling towards the North and increase towards the East.
The second measure, if present, specifies the vertical component of this angle.
This angle is the elevation from the local horizontal plane.
If the second angle value is omitted, the vertical component is unknown.
If only one angle is present, <orientation> describes only the horizontal component.
For <heading>, the associated <speed> measure contains only the horizontal component of speed.

This document defines additional location elements carried by PIDF LO.
These additional elements provide greater reason to observe the privacy and security considerations described in RFC 4119 [RFC4119].
No further privacy or security measures are necessary.
RFC 4119 points back to RFC 3694
[RFC3693] to describe the threat model and the security requirements imposed on the GEOPRIV architecture for sharing location information as a result of the threat model.
It is important to note that these two documents often refer to threats related to the current location information of a presentity, while this document introduces dynamic information that may be used by attackers to anticipate the future location of a presentity.
While already a series of location snapshots is likely to offer information for guessing the future location of a presentity, it has to be said that including more information in a PIDF LO does increase the severity of an information leak.
Those who deploy location based services are in general strongly advised to provide their users with ways to control the distribution of location information to those who have been authorized to see it.
This section registers a new XML namespace (as described in [RFC3688]) and a new XML schema.

Appendix A.  Earth Centered, Earth Fixed Direction Vectors
The absolute orientation or heading of a presentity depends on its latitude and longitude.
The following vectors can be used to determine the absolute direction in the WGS 84 Earth Centered, Earth Fixed (X, Y, Z) coordinate space.
The direction of North as a unit vector in Earth Centered, Earth Fixed (ECEF) coordinates is: North
sin(longitude), cos(latitude) ] The direction of "up" (the upward normal of the horizontal plane) as a unit vector in ECEF coordinates is: Up
