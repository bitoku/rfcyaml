  title: __initial_text__
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates
    used\n   to enable validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths in the Border\n
    \  Gateway Protocol (BGP), as part of an extension to that protocol\n   known
    as BGPsec.  BGP is the standard for inter-domain routing in the\n   Internet;
    it is the \"glue\" that holds the Internet together.  BGPsec\n   is being developed
    as one component of a solution that addresses the\n   requirement to provide security
    for BGP.  The goal of BGPsec is to\n   provide full AS path validation based on
    the use of strong\n   cryptographic primitives.  The end entity (EE) certificates
    specified\n   by this profile are issued to routers within an AS.  Each of these\n
    \  certificates is issued under a Resource Public Key Infrastructure\n   (RPKI)
    Certification Authority (CA) certificate.  These CA\n   certificates and EE certificates
    both contain the AS Resource\n   extension.  An EE certificate of this type asserts
    that the router or\n   routers holding the corresponding private key are authorized
    to emit\n   secure route advertisements on behalf of the AS(es) specified in the\n
    \  certificate.  This document also profiles the format of certification\n   requests
    and specifies Relying Party (RP) certificate path validation\n   procedures for
    these EE certificates.  This document extends the\n   RPKI; therefore, this document
    updates the RPKI Resource Certificates\n   Profile (RFC 6487).\n"

    \  certificates [RFC5280] for use in the context of certification of\n   Autonomous
    System (AS) paths in the BGPsec protocol.  Such\n   certificates are termed \"BGPsec
    Router Certificates\".  The holder of\n   the private key associated with a BGPsec
    Router Certificate is\n   authorized to send secure route advertisements (BGPsec
    UPDATEs) on\n   behalf of the AS(es) named in the certificate.  A router holding
    the\n   private key is authorized to send route advertisements (to its peers)\n
    \  identifying the router's AS number (ASN) as the source of the\n   advertisements.
    \ A key property provided by BGPsec is that every AS\n   along the AS path can
    verify that the other ASes along the path have\n   authorized the advertisement
    of the given route (to the next AS along\n   the AS path).\n   This document is
    a profile of [RFC6487], which is a profile of\n   [RFC5280]; thus, this document
    updates [RFC6487].  It establishes\n   requirements imposed on a Resource Certificate
    that is used as a\n   BGPsec Router Certificate, i.e., it defines constraints
    for\n   certificate fields and extensions for the certificate to be valid in\n
    \  this context.  This document also profiles the certification requests\n   used
    to acquire BGPsec Router Certificates.  Finally, this document\n   specifies the

    in the Resource Public Key\n   Infrastructure (RPKI) and some of the products
    generated by RPKI\n   entities.  IANA issues a Certification Authority (CA) certificate
    to\n   each Regional Internet Registry (RIR).  The RIR in turn issues a\n   CA
    certificate to an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  The ISP\n   in turn issues
    EE certificates to itself to enable verification of\n   signatures on RPKI signed
    objects.  The CA also generates Certificate\n   Revocation Lists (CRLs).  These
    CA and EE certificates are referred\n   to as \"Resource Certificates\" and are
    profiled in [RFC6487].\n   [RFC6480] envisioned using Resource Certificates to
    enable\n   verification of manifests [RFC6486] and Route Origin Authorizations\n

    1\n   This document defines another type of Resource Certificate, which is\n   referred
    to as a \"BGPsec Router Certificate\".  The purpose of this\n   certificate is
    explained in Section 1 and falls within the scope of\n   appropriate uses defined
    within [RFC6484].  The issuance of BGPsec\n   Router Certificates has minimal
    impact on RPKI CAs because the RPKI\n   CA certificate and CRL profile remain
    unchanged (i.e., they are as\n   specified in [RFC6487]).  Further, the algorithms
    used to generate\n   RPKI CA certificates that issue the BGPsec Router Certificates
    and\n   the CRLs necessary to check the validity of the BGPsec Router\n   Certificates
    remain unchanged (i.e., they are as specified in\n   [RFC7935]).  The only impact
    is that RPKI CAs will need to be able to\n   process a profiled certificate request
    (see Section 3.2) signed with\n   algorithms found in [RFC8208].  BGPsec Router
    Certificates are used\n   only to verify the signature on the BGPsec certificate
    request (only\n   CAs process these) and the signature on a BGPsec UPDATE message\n
    \  [RFC8205] (only BGPsec routers process these); BGPsec Router\n   Certificates
    are not used to process manifests and ROAs or verify\n   signatures on Certificates
    or CRLs.\n   This document enumerates only the differences between this profile\n
    \  and the profile in [RFC6487].  Note that BGPsec Router Certificates\n   are
    EE certificates, and as such there is no impact on the algorithm\n   agility procedure
    described in [RFC6916].\n"

    \  Certificate profile as specified in [RFC6487].  As a result, many of\n   the
    design choices herein are a reflection of the design choices that\n   were taken
    in that prior work.  The reader is referred to [RFC6484]\n   for a fuller discussion
    of those choices.\n   CAs are required by the Certificate Policy (CP) [RFC6484]
    to issue\n   properly formed BGPsec Router Certificates regardless of what is\n
    \  present in the certificate request, so there is some flexibility\n   permitted
    in the certificate requests:\n   o  BGPsec Router Certificates are always EE certificates;
    therefore,\n      requests to issue a CA certificate result in EE certificates;\n
    \  o  BGPsec Router Certificates are always EE certificates; therefore,\n      requests
    for Key Usage extension values keyCertSign and cRLSign\n      result in certificates
    with neither of these values;\n   o  BGPsec Router Certificates always include
    the BGPsec Router EKU\n      value; therefore, requests without the value result
    in\n      certificates with the value; and,\n   o  BGPsec Router Certificates
    never include the SIA extension;\n      therefore, requests with this extension
    result in certificates\n      without the extension.\n   Note that this behavior
    is similar to the CA including the\n   AS Resources extension in issued BGPsec
    Router Certificates, despite\n   the fact that it is not present in the request.\n"

  - "5.  Implementation Considerations\n   This document permits the operator to include
    a list of ASNs in a\n   BGPsec Router Certificate.  In that case, the router certificate\n
    \  would become invalid if any one of the ASNs is removed from any\n   superior
    CA certificate along the path to a trust anchor.  Operators\n   could choose to
    avoid this possibility by issuing a separate BGPsec\n   Router Certificate for
    each distinct ASN, so that the router\n   certificates for ASNs that are retained
    in the superior CA\n   certificate would remain valid.\n"
  title: 5.  Implementation Considerations
- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC6487] apply.\n
    \  A BGPsec Router Certificate will fail RPKI validation as defined in\n   [RFC6487]
    because the cryptographic algorithms used are different.\n   Consequently, an
    RP needs to identify the EKU to determine the\n   appropriate Validation constraint.\n
    \  A BGPsec Router Certificate is an extension of the RPKI [RFC6480] to\n   encompass
    routers.  It is a building block of BGPsec and is used to\n   validate signatures
    on BGPsec Signature Segment origination of\n   signed path segments [RFC8205].
    \ Thus, its essential security\n   function is the secure binding of one or more
    ASNs to a public key,\n   consistent with the RPKI allocation/assignment hierarchy.\n
    \  Hash functions [RFC8208] are used when generating the two key\n   identifier
    extensions (i.e., Subject Key Identifier and Issuer Key\n   Identifier) included
    in BGPsec certificates.  However, as noted in\n   [RFC6818], collision resistance
    is not a required property of one-way\n   hash functions when used to generate
    key identifiers.  Regardless,\n   hash collisions are unlikely, but they are possible,
    and if detected\n   an operator should be alerted.  A Subject Key Identifier collision\n
    \  might cause the incorrect certificate to be selected from the cache,\n   resulting
    in a failed signature validation.\n"
