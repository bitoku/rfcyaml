  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 5280 [RFC5280] defines a profile for the use of public\
    \ key\n   certificates for Internet applications.  If an application associates\n\
    \   application-state information with a public key certificate, then\n   that\
    \ association may be disrupted if the end entity changes its\n   public key certificate.\
    \  Such disruption can occur due to renewals or\n   if the end entity changes\
    \ its certificate issuer.  Similarly, if the\n   end entity is actually a distributed\
    \ system, where each instance has\n   a different private key, then the relying\
    \ party (RP) has no way to\n   associate the different public key certificates\
    \ with the relevant\n   application-state information.\n   For example, assume\
    \ a web browser retains state information (perhaps\n   passwords) about a web\
    \ site, indexed (possibly indirectly) via values\n   contained in the web server's\
    \ public key certificate (perhaps a DNS\n   name).  When the web server certificate\
    \ expires and a new certificate\n   is acquired (perhaps with a different DNS\
    \ name), then the browser\n   cannot safely map the new certificate to the relevant\
    \ state\n   information.\n   This memo defines a new public key certificate extension\
    \ that\n   supports such linkage, allowing the certificate issuer to attest that\n\
    \   the end entity that holds the private key for the certificate in\n   question\
    \ also holds other private keys corresponding to other\n   identified certificates.\n\
    \   Other than the issuer asserting that the set of certificates belongs\n   to\
    \ the same end entity for use with the same application, the fine\n   detail of\
    \ the semantics of the linkage of certificates is not defined\n   here, since\
    \ that is a matter for application developers and the\n   operators of certification\
    \ authorities (CAs).  In particular, we do\n   not define how a CA can validate\
    \ that the same end entity is the\n   holder of the various private keys, nor\
    \ how the application should\n   make use of this information.  Nor do we define\
    \ what kinds of state\n   information may be shared.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  A Use Case
  contents:
  - "2.  A Use Case\n   Public key certificates expire, typically about a year after\
    \ they are\n   created.  Some applications might need to know that the same entity\n\
    \   is the subject of the current certificate and a previously used\n   certificate.\n\
    \   For example, if a web server certificate expires, it could be useful\n   for\
    \ a web browser to know that the server currently presenting a\n   certificate\
    \ in a Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] handshake\n   represents the same\
    \ web server that previously presented a\n   certificate.  This could be used,\
    \ for example, to allow the browser\n   to automatically fill in form fields for\
    \ the server in question, even\n   if the server certificate has been replaced.\
    \  While the same effect\n   can be achieved based on the use of the same issuer\
    \ and subject\n   fields in a certificate, there could be security issues involved\
    \ in\n   such comparisons, e.g., if the subject name includes a DNS name and\n\
    \   the ownership of that DNS domain has changed.\n   The use of the new extension\
    \ provides a way for the CA to signal to\n   the application that the same end\
    \ entity is involved, regardless of\n   name changes.  The new extension could\
    \ also allow the web site\n   operator to more easily change the CA when replacing\
    \ its certificate.\n"
- title: 3.  Other Certificates Extension
  contents:
  - "3.  Other Certificates Extension\n   This section defines the syntax for the\
    \ other certificates extension.\n   The new extension is simply a list of references\
    \ to the linked\n   certificates.  The references make use of the SCVPCertID structure\n\
    \   from the Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP)\n   [RFC5055],\
    \ which contains a hash over the relevant certificate and\n   the certificate's\
    \ issuer and serial number.\n   When this extension is present, the CA is asserting\
    \ that the same end\n   entity is the subject of the relevant certificates.\n\
    \   This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.\n   id-pe-otherCerts OBJECT IDENTIFIER\
    \ ::= { id-pe 19 }\n   OtherCertificates ::= SEQUENCE OF SCVPCertID\n   CAs MUST\
    \ only issue certificates containing this extension where the\n   links created\
    \ are such that the relevant consumers of the\n   certificates can safely make\
    \ use of those links.  This will typically\n   be the case where the certificates\
    \ are only used by a single\n   application.  CAs MUST NOT issue certificates\
    \ that link to\n   certificates issued for a different purpose, for example, a\
    \ CA SHOULD\n   NOT link a web server certificate to a VPN gateway certificate\n\
    \   (unless those can be the same, which might occur for some embedded\n   devices).\
    \  The purpose for which the certificate is intended may be\n   determined by\
    \ certificate policy or other means (e.g., extended key\n   usage object identifiers)\
    \ that are out of the scope of this\n   specification.\n   CAs MUST NOT issue\
    \ certificates containing this extension unless they\n   have validated that the\
    \ end entity is the holder of all of the\n   relevant private keys.\n   Applications\
    \ MUST validate certificates according to the rules\n   specified in RFC 5280\
    \ [RFC5280] and MUST NOT assume that because\n   certificates are linked that\
    \ they are therefore valid.  This means,\n   of course, that both certificates\
    \ must chain up to some local trust\n   point(s).\n   If an application imposes\
    \ further checks on certificate validity\n   (e.g., as is done in RFC 2818 [RFC2818]\
    \ for web server certificates),\n   then both certificates MUST be valid according\
    \ to those application-\n   specific rules.\n   It is not required that two linked\
    \ certificates be simultaneously\n   valid.  For example, an application can validate\
    \ certificate1 and\n   cache that information.  When the application is subsequently\n\
    \   presented with certificate2 (linked back to certificate1), if it\n   considers\
    \ the cached information about certificate1 trustworthy, then\n   it can validate\
    \ certificate2 and use the linkage to associate\n   certificate2 with the relevant\
    \ application-state information (just as\n   it would have done had certificate1\
    \ been re-presented).  As a second\n   example, if certificate1 has expired but\
    \ would otherwise be valid,\n   then the linkage from certificate2 can also be\
    \ used once certificate2\n   has been validated.\n   If the application checks\
    \ certificate status for the certificates in\n   question, and any of the certificates\
    \ concerned has been revoked,\n   then the linkage MUST NOT be used.\n   Note\
    \ that there are no constraints on the contents of the certificate\n   to which\
    \ the link points.  The consequence is that the CA issuing the\n   new certificate\
    \ can link back to legacy certificates of all kinds,\n   once the relevant RP\
    \ supports this extension.\n   This extension MUST only be used in end-entity\
    \ certificates, that is,\n   it MUST NOT be used in CA certificates or other similar\
    \ certificates.\n   Since CA certificates are only used for certificate validation\
    \ and\n   this extension has no effect on the validation procedure, this\n   extension\
    \ would generally be meaningless in a CA certificate.  In\n   addition, it may\
    \ be wise to gain some deployment experience with this\n   extension before using\
    \ it for more security-sensitive certificates,\n   like CA certificates.\n"
- title: 4.  Another Approach Using Permanent Identifiers
  contents:
  - "4.  Another Approach Using Permanent Identifiers\n   RFC 4043 [RFC4043] defines\
    \ a new name form (a \"Permanent Identifier\"\n   or PI) for public key certificates\
    \ that supports similar\n   functionality to the new extension defined here. \
    \ If two certificates\n   have the same PI and that PI form is globally unique,\
    \ then the end\n   entities involved can be considered to be the same.\n   The\
    \ main difference between the PI and the other certificates\n   extension is that\
    \ (when more than one CA is involved) PI requires a\n   globally unique identifier,\
    \ whereas the other certificates extension\n   only requires that the issuer of\
    \ the new certificate be able to link\n   back to the old certificate(s).\n  \
    \ As a consequence, the other certificates extension can be deployed\n   \"reactively\"\
    \ to link certificates that may not match \"ideal\"\n   application-naming requirements.\
    \  If the old certificate did make use\n   of PI, then presumably application-naming\
    \ issues have already been\n   handled, and then the new certificate can contain\
    \ the same PI.  In\n   this latter case, there would be no need for the other\
    \ certificates\n   extension.\n"
- title: 5.  A Possible Optimisation
  contents:
  - "5.  A Possible Optimisation\n   The SCVPCertID structure used here contains the\
    \ issuer name for the\n   CA of the linked certificate.  It may happen that this\
    \ issuer is also\n   the issuer of the certificate containing the other certificates\n\
    \   extension.  If a new certificate were linked back to a number of old\n   certificates\
    \ from that same CA, then there would be considerable\n   redundancy since there\
    \ would be many copies of the same issuer name.\n   One suggestion raised was\
    \ to have a convention where if the X.500\n   Name in the SCVPCertID is an \"\
    empty\" DN (see RFC5280), then that\n   would indicate that the same CA issued\
    \ both the current and the\n   linked certificates.  However, that scheme is not\
    \ adopted in this\n   version.  A future, Standards Track version of this specification\n\
    \   might adopt that optimisation.\n"

  - "6.  Acknowledgements\n   The use case motivating this was contributed to the\
    \ W3C web security\n   context (WSC) working group by Tyler Close.  See\n   http://www.w3.org/2006/WSC/wiki/SafeWebFormEditor\
    \ for details.\n   Denis Pinkas pointed out that the PI extension is an alternative\
    \ to\n   this one.\n   James Manger suggested the optimisation to reduce the number\
    \ of\n   copies of the issuer name.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   As stated above, relying parties MUST validate\
    \ any certificates per\n   the algorithm given in RFC 5280 [RFC5280] before making\
    \ any use of\n   those certificates.\n   Relying parties similarly MUST NOT assume\
    \ that any other fields in\n   the relevant certificates have common values. \
    \ For example, linked\n   certificates might have non-overlapping key usage extensions.\n\
    \   Since the issuer of the new certificate (or some superior CA) is\n   trusted\
    \ by the RP, and the RP has validated the new certificate, the\n   RP is basically\
    \ as reliant on the proper operation of that CA as\n   always -- if the CA wished\
    \ to \"cheat\" on the RP, the other\n   certificates extension simply provides\
    \ a new way to do that, but one\n   that is equivalent to existing vulnerabilities.\
    \  In many cases, such\n   a bad CA could simply issue a new certificate that\
    \ is identical in\n   all respects (other than the key pair) and the RP would\
    \ accept the\n   identity contained in that new certificate.\n   However, if the\
    \ issuer of the new certificate is limited in some way\n   (e.g., via a name constraint\
    \ in a superior CA certificate), and if\n   the old certificate doesn't match\
    \ those limitations (e.g., the\n   subject of the old certificate doesn't fit\
    \ under the name constraints\n   of the issuer of the new certificate), then the\
    \ new certificate could\n   be linked back to an identity that doesn't meet the\
    \ constraints\n   intended to be imposed on the issuer of the new certificate.\n\
    \   Applications for which this is an unacceptable risk SHOULD NOT make\n   use\
    \ of the other certificates extension.\n   Since the SCVPCertID structure includes\
    \ a hash of the other\n   certificate and hash algorithm weaknesses that produce\
    \ collisions are\n   becoming more of an issue, CAs and relying parties MUST ensure\
    \ that\n   currently acceptable hash functions are used.  In particular, the\n\
    \   default use of SHA-1 for SCVPCertID may or may not currently be\n   considered\
    \ acceptable.  CAs might be wise to use SHA-256 instead, but\n   will typically\
    \ use whatever hash function they use as part of\n   certificate signing.\n  \
    \ In some application contexts, if the old certificate has expired (and\n   perhaps\
    \ any associated certificate revocation list (CRL) entries are\n   no longer on\
    \ the latest CRL), it may be unsafe to link the new and\n   old certificates.\
    \  Application developers SHOULD carefully consider\n   whether to make use of\
    \ the other certificates extension in such\n   contexts.\n"
