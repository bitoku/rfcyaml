Abstract This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package that enables the collection and reporting of metrics that measure the quality for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions.
Voice call quality information derived from RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) and call
information from SIP is conveyed from a User Agent (UA) in a session, known as a reporter, to a third party, known as a collector.
A registration for the application/ vq  rtcpxr media type is also included.
Introduction Real time communications over IP networks use SIP for signaling with RTP/RTCP for media transport and reporting, respectively.
These protocols are very flexible and can support an extremely wide spectrum of usage scenarios.
For this reason, extensions to these protocols must be specified in the context of a specific usage scenario.
In this memo, extensions to SIP are proposed to support the reporting of RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports [4] metrics.
Applicability Statement RTP is utilized in many different architectures and topologies.
RFC 5117 [13] lists and describes the following topologies: point to  point, point to multipoint using multicast, point to multipoint using the translator from RFC 3550, point to multipoint using the mixer model from RFC 3550, point to multipoint using video switching Multipoint Control Units (MCUs), point to multipoint using RTCP  terminating MCU, and non symmetric mixer/translators.
As the Abstract of this document points out, this specification is for reporting quality of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions.
As such, only the first topology, point to point, is currently supported by this specification.
This reflects both current VoIP deployments, which are predominantly point to point using unicast, and the state of research in the area of quality.
How to accurately report the quality of a multipart conference or a session involving multiple hops through translators and mixers is currently an area of research in the industry.
However, this mechanism can easily be used for centrally mixed conference calls, in which each leg of the conferences is just a point to point call.
This mechanism could be extended to cover additional RTP topologies in the future once these topics progress out of the realm of research and into actual Internet deployments.
Use of the Mechanism RTCP reports are usually sent to other participating endpoints in a session.
This can make the collection of performance information by an administrator or management system quite complex to implement.
In the usage scenarios addressed in this memo, the data contained in RTCP XR VoIP metrics reports (RFC 3611 [4]) are forwarded to a central collection server systems using SIP.
Applications residing in the server or elsewhere can aid in network management to alleviate bandwidth constraints and also to support customer service by identifying and acknowledging calls of poor quality.
However, specifying such applications is beyond the scope of this paper.
There is a large portfolio of quality parameters that can be associated with VoIP, but only a minimal necessary number of parameters are included on the RTCP XR reports: 1.
The codec type, as resulting from the Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer answer negotiation in SIP, 2.
The burst gap loss density and max gap duration, since voice cut  outs are the most annoying quality impairment in VoIP, 3.
Round trip delay, because it is critical to conversational quality, 4.
Conversational quality as a catch all for other voice quality impairments, such as randomly distributed packet loss, jitter, annoying silent suppression effects, etc.
In specific usage scenarios where other parameters are required, designers can include other parameters beyond the scope of this paper.
RTCP reports are best effort only, and though they are very useful, they have a number of limitations as discussed in [3].
This must be considered when using RTCP reports in managed networks.
This document defines a new SIP event package, vq rtcpxr, and a new MIME type, application/vq rtcpxr, that enable the collection and reporting of metrics that measure quality for RTP [3] sessions.
The definitions of the metrics used in the event package are based on RTCP Extended Reports [4] and RTCP [3]; a mapping between the SIP event parameters and the parameters within the aforementioned RFCs is defined within this document in Section 4.6.2.
Monitoring of voice quality is believed to be the highest priority for usage of this mechanism, and as such, the metrics in the event package are largely tailored for voice quality measurements.
The event package is designed to be extensible.
However, the negotiation of such extensions is not defined in this document.
The event package supports reporting the voice quality metrics for both the inbound and outbound directions.
Voice quality metrics for the inbound direction can generally be computed locally by the reporting endpoint; however, voice quality metrics for the outbound direction are computed by the remote endpoint and sent to the reporting endpoint using the RTCP Extended Reports [4].
The configuration of the usage of this event package is not covered in this document.
It is the recommendation of this document that the SIP configuration framework [15] be used.
This is discussed in Section 4.8.
The event package SHOULD be used with the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY method; however, it MAY also be used with the PUBLISH method [8] for backward compatibility with some existing implementations.
Message flow examples for both methods are provided in this document.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].
SIP Events for VoIP Quality Reporting
This document defines a SIP events package [5] for Voice over IP performance reporting.
A SIP UA can send these events to an entity that can make the information available to other applications.
For purposes of illustration, the entities involved in SIP vq rtcpxr event reporting will be referred to as follows:
an entity involved in the measurement and reporting of media quality, i.e., the SIP UA involved in a media session.
COLLECTOR: an entity that receives SIP vq rtcpxr events.
A COLLECTOR may be a proxy server or another entity that is capable of supporting SIP vq rtcpxr events.
The COLLECTOR SHALL send a SUBSCRIBE to the REPORTER to explicitly establish the relationship.
The REPORTER SHOULD send the voice quality metric reports using the NOTIFY method.
The REPORTER MUST NOT send any vq rtcpxr events if a COLLECTOR address has not been configured.
The REPORTER populates the Request URI according to the rules for an in dialog request.
The COLLECTOR MAY send a SUBSCRIBE to a SIP Proxy acting on behalf of the reporting SIP UAs.
PUBLISH Method A SIP UA that supports this specification MAY also send the service quality metric reports using the PUBLISH method [8]; however, this approach SHOULD NOT be used, in general, on the public Internet.
The PUBLISH method MAY be supported for backward compatibility with existing implementations.
The REPORTER MAY therefore populate the Request URI of the PUBLISH method with the address of the COLLECTOR.
To ensure security of SIP proxies and the COLLECTOR, the REPORTER MUST be configured with the address of the COLLECTOR, preferably using the SIP UA configuration framework [15], as described in Section 5.8.
It is RECOMMENDED that the REPORTER send an OPTIONS message to the COLLECTOR to ensure support of the PUBLISH message.
If PUBLISH is not supported, then the REPORTER can only wait for a SUBSCRIBE request from the COLLECTOR and then deliver the information in NOTIFYs.
If a REPORTER sends a PUBLISH to a COLLECTOR that does not support or allow this method, a 501 Not Implemented or a 405 Method
Not Allowed response will be received, and the REPORTER will stop publication.
Multi Party and Multi Segment Calls
A voice quality metric report may be sent for each session terminating at the REPORTER, and it may contain multiple report bodies.
For a multi party call, the report MAY contain report bodies for the session between the reporting endpoint and each remote endpoint for which there was an RTP session during the call.
Multi party services such as call hold and call transfer can result in the user participating in a series of concatenated sessions, potentially with different choices of codec or sample rate, although these may be perceived by the user as a single call.
A REPORTER MAY send a voice quality metric report at the end of each session or MAY send a single voice quality metric report containing an application/ vq rtcpxr body for each segment of the call.
Overload Avoidance Users of this extension should ensure that they implement general SIP mechanisms for avoiding overload.
For instance, an overloaded proxy or COLLECTOR MUST send a 503 Service Unavailable or other 5xx response with an appropriate Retry After time specified.
REPORTERs MUST act on these responses and respect the Retry After time interval.
In addition, future SIP extensions to better handle overload as covered in [14]
should be followed as they are standardized.
To avoid overload of SIP Proxies or COLLECTORS, it is important to do capacity planning and to minimize the number of reports that are sent.
Approaches to avoiding overload include: a.  Send only one report at the end of each call.
Use interval reports only on "problem" calls that are being closely monitored.
Limit the number of alerts that can be sent to a maximum of one per call.
Event Package Formal Definition 4.1.
This document defines a SIP Event Package.
SIP Event Packages were originally defined in RFC 3265 [5].
No event package parameters are defined.
SUBSCRIBE Bodies SUBSCRIBE bodies are described by this specification.
Subscribe Duration Subscriptions to this event package MAY range from minutes to weeks.
Subscriptions in hours or days are more typical and are RECOMMENDED.
The default subscription duration for this event package is one hour.
There are three notify bodies: a Session report, an Interval report, and an Alert report.
The Session report SHOULD be used for reporting when a voice media session terminates, when a media change occurs, such as a codec change or a session fork, or when a session terminates due to no media packets being received and MUST NOT be used for reporting at arbitrary points in time.
This report MUST be used for cumulative metric reporting and the report timestamps MUST be from the start of a media session to the time at which the report is generated.
The Interval report SHOULD be used for periodic or interval reporting and MUST NOT be used for reporting of the complete media session.
This report is intended to capture short duration metric reporting and the report intervals SHOULD be non overlapping time windows.
The Alert report MAY be used when voice quality degrades during a session.
The time window to which an Alert report relates MAY be a short time interval or from the start of the call to the point the alert is generated; this time window SHOULD be selected to provide the most useful information to support problem diagnosis.
Session, Interval, and Alert reports MUST populate the metrics with values that are measured over the interval explicitly defined by the "start" and "stop" timestamps.
Voice quality summary reports reference only one codec (payload type).
This payload type SHOULD be the main voice payload, not comfort noise or telephone event payloads.
For applications that consistently and rapidly switch codecs, the most used codec should be reported.
All values in the report, such as IP addresses, synchronization source (SSRC), etc., represent those values as received by the REPORTER.
In some scenarios, these may not be the same on either end of the session
the COLLECTOR will need logic to be able to put these sessions together.
The values of parameters such as sample rate, frame duration, frame octets, packets per second, round trip delay, etc., depend on the type of report in which they are present.
If present in a Session or an Interval report, they represent average values over the session or interval.
If present in an Alert report, they represent instantaneous values.
The REPORTER always includes local quality reporting information and should, if possible, share remote quality reporting information to the COLLECTOR.
This remote quality could be available from received RTCP XR reports or other sources.
Reporting this is useful in cases where the other end might support RTCP XR but not this voice quality reporting.
This specification defines a new MIME type, application/vq rtcpxr, which is a text encoding of the RTCP and RTCP XR statistics with some additional metrics and correlation information.
Voice Quality Event and Semantics
This section describes the syntax extensions required for event publication in SIP.
The formal syntax definitions described in this section are expressed in the Augmented BNF [6] format used in SIP [2] and contain references to elements defined therein.
Additionally, the definition of the timestamp format is provided in [7].
Note that most of the parameters are optional.
In practice, most implementations will send a subset of the parameters.
It is not the intention of this document to define what parameters may or may not be useful for monitoring the quality of a voice session, but to enable reporting of voice quality.
As such, the syntax allows the implementer to choose which metrics are most appropriate for their solution.
As there are no "invalid",
"unknown", or "not applicable" values in the syntax
, the intention is to exclude any parameters for which values are not available, not applicable, or unknown.
The authors recognize that implementers may need to add new parameter lines to the reports and new metrics to the existing parameter lines.
The extension tokens are intended to fulfill this need.

Parameter Definitions and Mappings Parameter values, codec types, and other aspects of the endpoints may change dynamically during a session.
The reported values of metrics and configuration parameters SHALL be the current value at the time the report is generated.
The Packet Loss Rate and Packet Discard Rate parameters are calculated over the period between the starting and ending timestamps for the report.
These are normally calculated from a count of the number of lost or discarded packets divided by the count of the number of packets, and hence are based on the current values of these counters at the time the report was generated.
Packet delay variation, signal level, noise level, and echo level are computed as running or interval averages, based on the appropriate standard, e.g., RFC 3550 for Packet Delay Variation (PDV), and the sampled value of these running averages is reported.
Delay, packet size, jitter buffer size, and codec related data may change during a session and the current value of these parameters is reported as sampled at the time the report is generated.
General Mapping Percentages from 8 bit, Fixed Point Numbers RFC 3611 uses an 8 bit, fixed point number with the binary point at the left edge of the field.
This value is calculated by dividing the total number of packets lost by the total number of packets expected and multiplying the result by 256, and then taking the integer part.
For any RTCP XR parameter in this format, to map into the equivalent SIP vq rtcpxr parameter, simply reverse the equation, i.e., divide by 256 and take the integer part.
Timestamps Following SIP and other IETF conventions, timestamps are provided in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) using the ABNF format provided in RFC 3339 [7].
These timestamps SHOULD reflect, as closely as possible, the actual time during which the media session was running to enable correlation to related events occurring in the network and to accounting or billing records.
The parameters in this field provide a shortened version of the session SDP(s), containing only the relevant parameters for session quality reporting purposes.
Where values may change during a session, for example, a codec may change rate, then the most recent value of the parameter is reported.
This is the "payload type" parameter used in the RTP packets, i.e., the codec.
This field can also be mapped from the SDP "rtpmap" attribute field "payload type".
IANA registered types SHOULD be used.

The SSRC is taken from SDP, RTCP, or RTCP XR input parameters.
In the presence of NAT and where a NAT traversal mechanism such as Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)
[16] is used, the external IP address can be reported, since the internal IP address is not visible to the network operator.

Configuration Dataset for vq rtcpxr Events
It is the suggestion of the authors that the SIP configuration framework [15] be used to establish the necessary parameters for usage of vq rtcpxr events.
A dataset for this purpose should be designed and documented in a separate document upon completion of the framework.
This document registers a new SIP Event Package and a new media type.
SIP Event Package Registration Package name: vq rtcpxr Type:
application/vq rtcpxr Media Type Registration Type name:
application Subtype name: vq rtcpxr Required parameters: none Optional parameters: none Encoding considerations: 7 bit Security considerations: See next section.
Applications that use this media type: This document type is being used in notifications of VoIP quality reports.

COMMON Author / Change controller:
Security Considerations RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide information about the nature and duration of a session established between two or more endpoints.
As a result, any third party wishing to obtain this information SHOULD be properly authenticated by the SIP UA using standard SIP mechanisms and according to the recommendations in [5].
Additionally, the event content MAY be encrypted to ensure confidentiality; the mechanisms for providing confidentiality are detailed in [2].
The authors would like to thank Rajesh Kumar, Dave Oran, Tom Redman, Shane Holthaus, and Jack Ford for their comments and input.
