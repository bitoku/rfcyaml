  - "respond directly to the points raised in RFC #603.\n    1.  The important consideration\
    \ in deciding whether it is good or\n    bad to have a node (AMES) be four connected\
    \ is not how many circuits\n    are affected by a node failure; rather one should\
    \ consider how well\n    the network is still connected after a node failure.\
    \  For example,\n    if ALL nodes in the network were four-connected I doubt that\
    \ anyone\n    would argue that this was bad for reliability.  The weaknesses are\n\
    \    not the three-connected and four-connected nodes but rather the\n    ONE-connected\
    \ (Hawaii, London) and two-connected nodes.  I must\n    agree with Burchfiel's\
    \ implied argument that it is better to have\n    two adjacent three-connected\
    \ nodes than to have a four-connected\n    node adjacent to a two-connected node;\
    \  unfortunately the realities\n    of installing interfaces and common carrier\
    \ services cause the\n    Network to expand in sub-optimal ways.\n    2.  \"Loops\"\
    \ are not good per se, they appear good because the act of\n    making loops increases\
    \ the connectivity and thereby reduces the\n    effect of multiple failures. \
    \ Adding more circuits costs ARPA money,\n    both capital cost for IMP interfaces\
    \ and recurring cost for the\n    circuits. The network group at BBN has suggested\
    \ to ARPA several\n    times that \"connectivity should be increased\" but it\
    \ was only late\n    in December 1973 that we made specific suggestions for the\
    \ locations\n    of additional circuits.  These recommendations were not based\
    \ on\n    building loops (although they may have that effect) but were based\n\
    \    on breaking the long chains of IMPs which have occurred as the\n    Network\
    \ has grown.  ARPA and NAC are now presumably in the process\n    of evaluating\
    \ our suggestions, and perhaps formulating other\n    possibilities.\n       [\
