    \ RFC Numbers 1100-1199\nStatus of This Memo\n   This RFC is a slightly annotated\
    \ list of the 100 RFCs from RFC 1100\n   through RFCs 1199.  This is a status\
    \ report on these RFCs.  This memo\n   provides information for the Internet community.\
    \  It does not specify\n   an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is\
    \ unlimited.\nNote\n   Many RFCs, but not all, are Proposed Standards, Draft Standards,\
    \ or\n   Standards.  Since the status of these RFCs may change during the\n  \
    \ standards processing, we note here only that they are on the\n   standards track.\
    \  Please see the latest edition of \"IAB Official\n   Protocol Standards\" for\
    \ the current state and status of these RFCs.\n   In the following, RFCs on the\
    \ standards track are marked [STANDARDS-\n   TRACK].\n1199    Reynolds     Dec\

    \       Information\nThe purpose of this RFC is to inform implementors of multimedia\
    \ systems\nabout our experiences using ISO 8613: Office Document Architecture\n\
    (ODA).  Because ODA is being proposed as an encoding format for use in\nmultimedia\
    \ mail and file exchange, implementors wishing to use ODA in an\nopen systems\
    \ environment may profit from our experiences.  This memo\nprovides information\

    \ original Finger\nprotocol, this memo attempts to clarify the expected communication\n\
    between the two ends of a Finger connection.  It also tries not to\ninvalidate\
