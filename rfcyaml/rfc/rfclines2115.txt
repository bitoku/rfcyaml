This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP  based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing Frame Relay interfaces on DTEs.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
The major components of the SNMPv2 Network Management framework are described in the documents listed below.
[1] defines the Structure of Management Information (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
[2] defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects (MO) for the Internet suite of protocols.
[3] defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The framework is adaptable/extensible by defining new MIBs to suit the requirements of specific applications/protocols/situations.
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, the MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which is an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, often a textual string, termed the descriptor, is used to refer to the object type.
For the purposes of understanding this document, Frame Relay is viewed as a multi access media, not as a group of point  to point connections.
This model proposes that Frame Relay is a single interface to the network (physical connection) with many destinations or neighbors (virtual connections).
This view enables a network manager the ability to group all virtual connections with their corresponding physical connection thereby allowing simpler diagnostics and trouble shooting.
With the extension of the interfaces MIB, it is possible to configure frame relay DLCs as individual interfaces and create ifTable entries for each.
This is not recommended and is not directly supported by this MIB.
Additionally, in the presence of demand circuits creation of individual ifEntries for each is not possible.
Should the user wish to group DLCs together to associate them with a higher layer, or to associate a DLC with an unnumbered point to point service, the frame relay DTE MIB provides an entry in the frCircuitEntry record.
For example, suppose one were to configure a company proprietary protocol to run above several of the frame relay VCs.
A configuration which specified that DLCI 40, 41,and
42 were associated with a proprietary protocol layer, while DLCI 20 and 30 were to run IP directly can now be expressed using a combination of frCircuitIfIndex and frCircuitLogicalIfIndex.
In this particular case DLCIs 40, 41 and 42 would use frCircuitIfIndex equal to the frame relay interface level (2) while their frCircuitLogicalIfIndex would indicate the proprietary protocol (3).
DLCIs 20 and 30 would have both instances set to the frame relay interface (2).
As per DESCRIPTION in RFC 1573.
The value allocated for Frame Relay Interfaces frameRelay (32).
This could be different from the speed of the underlying physical interface, e.g. in a fractional T1 case the access rate could be 384 kbits/
s (the value reported in this object)
whereas the speed of the underlying interface would be 1.544 Mbits/s (the value reported in the instance of ifSpeed for the ifEntry with type ds1).
The primary address for this interface assigned by the Frame Relay interface provider.
An octet string of zero length if no address is used for this interface.
As per DESCRIPTION in RFC 1573.
As per DESCRIPTION in RFC 1573.
As per DESCRIPTION in RFC 1573.
The number of received octets.
This includes not only the information field (user data) but also the frame relay header and CRC.
The number of frames received on non  multicast DLCIs ifInDiscards
The number of frames that were successfully received but were discarded because of format errors or because the VC was not known.
Format errors, in this case, are any errors which would prevent the system from recognizing the DLCI and placing the error in the frCircuitDiscard category.
The number of received frames that are discarded, because of an error.
Possible errors can be the following: the frame relay frames were too long or were too short, the frames had an invalid or unrecognized DLCI values, or incorrect header values.
Number of unknown or unsupported upper layer protocol frames received and discarded.
The number of received octets.
This includes not only the information field (user data) but also the frame relay header and CRC.
The number of frames sent.
The number of frames discarded in the transmit direction.
The number of frames discarded in the egress direction, because of errors.
The number of unerrored frames received on a multicast DLCI.
Always zero (0) as there are no broadcast frames.
The number of frames transmitted over a multicast DLCI.
as there are no broadcast frames.
Only required when ifSpeed >  155 Mbits/s.
ifLinkUpDownTrapEnble  As per DESCRIPTION in RFC 1573.
The access rate of the frame relay interface measured in Mbits/s.
If the access rate is less than 1 Mbits/s, this object returns 0.
One new data type is introduced as a textual convention in this MIB document.
This textual convention enhances the readability of the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if appropriate.
It should be noted that the introduction of this textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed objects.
The use of this is merely an artifact of the explanatory method used.
Objects defined in terms of one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that define the primitive type.
Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate this textual conventions which is adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.
The new data type is DLCI.
DLCI refers to the range 0..DLCINumber, and is used to refer to the valid Data Link Connection Indices.
DLCINumber is, by definition, the largest possible DLCI value possible under the configured Q.922 Address Format.
The MIB is composed of three groups, one defining the Data Link Connection Management Interface (DLCMI), one describing the Circuits, and a third describing errors.
During normal operation, Frame Relay virtual circuits will be added, deleted and change availability.
The occurrence of such changes is of interest to the network manager and therefore, one trap is defined, intended to be corollary to the SNMP
"Link Up" and "Link Down" traps.
Below are listed the changes from the previously published version this document, which was RFC 1315:
The MIB module was converted from SMIv1 to SMIv2 format.
Note: due to this, the table indices have access of "read only" instead of "not accessible", which is the typical value for index objects in SMIv2.
The module name was changed from RFC1315 MIB to FRAME  RELAY DTE MIB.
The textual convention "Index" was dropped from the MIB module and "InterfaceIndex" from the interfaces MIB module, IF MIB, was used in its place.
Objects frDlcmiStatus and frDlcmiRowStatus were added to table frDlcmiTable.
Added values "itut933A(5)" (from CCITT Q933 Annex A) and "ansiT1617D1994(6)" (from ANSI
to the enumerations for object
The labels for the enumerated values for object frDlcmiAddressLen were renamed to remove their hyphens as required by SMIv2.
Added clarification that the "management virtual circuit" (i.e. DLCI 0) is a member of the circuit table.
Added the following objects to table
frCircuitMulticast, frCircuitType, frCircuitDiscards, frCircuitReceivedDEs, frCircuitSentDEs, frCircuitLogicalIfIndex, and  frCircuitRowStatus.
The definition of object frCircuitReceivedOctets was clarified as to which octets were counted.
Added the objects frErrFaults and frErrFaultTime to table frErrTable.
Added clarification to the values of object
Added size on definition of object frErrData and clarified what data to capture.
Changed identififier for OID value { frameDelayDTE 4 } from frame relay globals to frameRelayTrapControl.
Created object groups frPortGroup, frCircuitGroup, frTrapGroup, frErrGroup, frPortGroup0, frCircuitGroup0, frTrapGroup0, and
Created module compliances frCompliance and frCompliance0.
Added ranges to objects frCircuitCommittedBurst, frCircuitExcessBurst, and frCircuitThroughput.

Data   Link Connection Identifiers enumerate virtual circuits   (permanent or dynamic) which are layered onto the underlying   circuit, represented by ifEntry.
Therefore, each of the entries   in the Standard MIB's Interface Table with an IfType of   Frame Relay represents a Q.922 interface.
Zero or more   virtual circuits are layered onto this interface and provide   interconnection with various remote destinations.
Each such virtual circuit is represented by an entry in the   circuit table.

"Indicates whether the particular virtual circuit is operational.
In the absence of a Data Link Connection Management Interface, virtual circuit entries (rows) may be created by setting virtual circuit state to 'active', or deleted by changing Circuit state to 'invalid'.
Whether or not the row actually disappears is left to the implementation, so this object may actually read as 'invalid' for some arbitrary length of time.
It is also legal to set the state of a virtual circuit to 'inactive' to temporarily disable a given circuit.
The use of 'invalid' is deprecated in this SNMP Version 2 MIB, in favor of frCircuitRowStatus."

Normally the same value as frDlcmiIfIndex, but different when an implementation associates a virtual ifEntry with a DLC or set of DLCs in order to associate higher layer objects such as the ipAddrEntry with a subset of the virtual circuits on a Frame Relay interface.
The type of such ifEntries is defined by the higher layer object; for example, if PPP/Frame Relay is implemented, the ifType of this ifEntry would be PPP.
If it is not so defined, as would be the case with an ipAddrEntry, it should be of type Other."
