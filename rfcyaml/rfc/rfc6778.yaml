  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.\n\
    \   Participants frequently need to search the archives of these lists\n   and\
    \ have asked for improved search capabilities, particularly when\n   the search\
    \ needs to cover a large period of time or cross several\n   lists.  For instance,\
    \ document editors, shepherds, working group\n   chairs, and area directors may\
    \ need to review all discussion of a\n   particular draft.  That discussion may\
    \ be spread across the working\n   group list, one or more directorate lists,\
    \ and the IETF general list.\n   Occasionally, work impacts multiple groups, possibly\
    \ in different\n   areas, and the search must cover additional working group lists.\n\
    \   The current tools for performing these searches require several\n   manually\
    \ coordinated steps, which are error prone.  Without a local\n   copy of the archive\
    \ (which may not be complete), searching most\n   working group lists requires\
    \ brute force effort, aided possibly by\n   web search engines.\n   More advanced\
    \ search capabilities have been constructed for a limited\n   subset of the available\
    \ lists and are exposed in the \"Email Archives\n   Quick Search\" section of\
    \ the main IETF website.  While these tools\n   are of great assistance, there\
    \ is still significant need for\n   improvement.\n   The current archive mechanism\
    \ could also be made more efficient.  The\n   current practices involve duplicate\
    \ stores (for the web and ftp\n   interfaces), which impact storage and replication\
    \ and are subject to\n   inconsistency.\n   This memo captures the requirements\
    \ for improved email list archiving\n   and searching systems.\n"

    '
- title: 2.1.  Search and Browsing
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Search and Browsing\n   o  The system must provide a web interface for\
    \ searching and browsing\n      archived messages.\n   o  The system must allow\
    \ browsing the entire archive of a given list\n      by thread or by date.\n \
    \  o  The system must allow browsing the results of a search by thread\n     \
    \ or by date.\n         Both threading based on Message-Id/References/In-Reply-To\
    \ and\n         threading based on same subject line (modulo short prefixes\n\
    \         like re: and fwd:) should be taken into account.\n   o  The system must\
    \ allow searching across any subset of the archived\n      lists (one list, a\
    \ selection of lists, or all lists).\n   o  The system must allow searching of\
    \ any combination (using AND, OR,\n      and NOT operators) of the following attributes.\
    \  Richer search\n      capabilities are highly desirable.\n      -  string occurring\
    \ in sender name or email address\n      -  date range\n      -  string occurring\
    \ in Subject\n      -  string occurring in message body\n      -  string occurring\
    \ in message header (in particular, exact match\n         of Message-Id)\n   \
    \         For instance, it would be nice to search the entire archive\n      \
    \      for instances of a message with a given Message-ID with a\n           \
    \ URL like <http://datatracker.ietf.org/mlarchive/\n            msg?id=4EA6E023.6010603@example.com>\n\
    \   o  Individual messages must be representable by a long-term stable\n     \
    \ URI that can be shared between users.  That is, the URI must be\n      suitable\
    \ for reference in an email message.\n      -  It would be preferable for that\
    \ URI to appear in an Archived-At\n         header field in the message [RFC5064].\n\
    \   o  Searches should be representable by a URI that can be shared\n      between\
    \ users.\n      -  Such URIs should be long-term stable.\n      -  The search\
    \ may be re-executed when the URI is referenced.  It\n         is acceptable for\
    \ the same URI to produce different results if\n         accessed at different\
    \ times or by different people (for\n         example, by reflecting additional\
    \ messages that may match the\n         search criteria or reflecting changes\
    \ in access authorization\n         to lists with restricted archives).\n   o\
    \  When the system requires credentials, it must use the\n      datatracker's\
    \ authentication system.\n      -  While the vast majority of archived lists have\
    \ an open access\n         policy, some archived lists have restricted archives.\n\
    \      -  The system must not require credentials for browsing or\n         searching\
    \ lists with open archives.  (But it is acceptable for\n         a user to browse\
    \ or search such lists while logged in.)\n      -  The system must make it possible\
    \ to limit access to a\n         restricted archive based on login credentials.\n\
    \      -  Messages from restricted archives must be distinguishable from\n   \
    \      messages from unrestricted archives in any search results.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Archiving Active Lists
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Archiving Active Lists\n   o  The archive system must accept messages handled\
    \ by various mail\n      list manager packages.\n      -  Lists hosted on the\
    \ IETF systems are served by Mailman\n         [Mailman].\n      -  Lists hosted\
    \ at other organizations may use other packages.\n         *  The archive system\
    \ must accept messages through subscribing\n            to such an external list.\n\
    \         *  The archive system may support other mechanisms for\n           \
    \ accepting messages into the archive.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Importing Messages from Other Archives
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Importing Messages from Other Archives\n   Lists hosted at other systems\
    \ are sometimes moved to the IETF\n   servers, and their archive is moved with\
    \ them.  The archiving system\n   must be able to import these archives.\n   o\
    \  At a minimum, the archive system must be able to import mbox\n      formatted\
    \ archives [RFC4155] [Mbox].\n   o  The archive system should be able to import\
    \ Maildir and Maildir-\n      like (the key characteristic being one-message-per-file)\
    \ formatted\n      archives [Maildir].\n   o  It is acceptable to use a separate\
    \ utility to convert between\n      these formats before import, as long as the\
    \ conversion is\n      lossless.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Exporting Messages from the Archives
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Exporting Messages from the Archives\n   The archive system must allow\
    \ both users and administrators to export\n   messages.\n   o  The archive system\
    \ must support exporting messages in the mbox\n      format.\n   o  The archive\
    \ system should support exporting messages in the\n      Maildir format.\n   o\
    \  The archive system must support exporting the entire archive of a\n      given\
    \ list.\n   o  The archive system must support exporting all messages from a\n\
    \      given list within a given date range.\n   o  The archive system should\
    \ allow exporting the results of any\n      supported search query.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Redundancy
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Redundancy\n   o  The systems must facilitate providing archive, search,\
    \ and browse\n      functions through geographically distributed servers.\n  \
    \    -  The systems must support a single active and single standby\n        \
    \ server.  This reflects the current operating configuration and\n         is\
    \ expected to be the initial deployment model.\n      -  The systems should support\
    \ a single active and multiple standby\n         servers.\n      -  The systems\
    \ should support multiple active servers for the\n         search and browse functions.\
    \  Support for multiple active\n         archive servers is not a requirement.\n\
    \      -  The amount of traffic generated to ensure data replication\n       \
    \  between servers should be on the order of the size of any new/\n         changed\
    \ messages in the archives.\n         *  It is acceptable for replication to be\
    \ part of the archival\n            system itself (such as using the replication\
    \ mechanisms from\n            an underlying database).\n         *  It is acceptable\
    \ to rely on replication of the underlying\n            filesystem objects (using\
    \ rsync of one or more directory\n            trees, for example), but only if\
    \ the objects in the\n            underlying filesystem are formatted such that\
    \ the size of\n            the replication data is on the order of the size of\
    \ any new/\n            changed messages in the archives.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Archive Administration
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Archive Administration\n   o  The archive system must support adding and\
    \ removing lists to be\n      archived.\n   o  The system must allow the administrator\
    \ to add messages to and\n      delete messages from an archived list.  The system\
    \ should log such\n      actions.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Transition Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Transition Requirements\n   There are many existing archived messages containing\
    \ embedded links\n   into the existing MHonArc [MHonArc] mail archive.  These\
    \ links must\n   continue to work, but they should reach the message as archived\
    \ in\n   the new system.\n"
- title: 3.  Internationalized Address Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Internationalized Address Considerations\n   The archive and search functions\
    \ should anticipate internationalized\n   email addresses as discussed in the\
    \ following three documents --\n   [RFC6531], [RFC6532], and [IMAP-UTF8].  There\
    \ is no firm requirement\n   at this time.\n"
- title: 4.  IMAP Access
  contents:
  - "4.  IMAP Access\n   Requirements for allowing access to the archives using IMAP\
    \ are\n   captured in [IMAP-ARCH].  The archive system must anticipate\n   integrating\
    \ with a system that provides IMAP access.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Creating a new tool for searching and archiving\
    \ IETF email lists does\n   not affect the security of the Internet in any significant\
    \ fashion.\n   Searching can be I/O and CPU intensive.  The implementors of this\n\
    \   tool should consider the potential for maliciously crafted searches\n   attempting\
    \ to consume all available resources.  Similarly, the\n   implementors should\
    \ consider the potential for denial-of-service\n   attacks through making many\
    \ connections to the browsing system or\n   rapid navigating within it.\n   Preserving\
    \ the integrity of the archives is important.  The\n   implementors should ensure\
    \ that administrative access is\n   appropriately authenticated, and that message\
    \ paths into the archive\n   are appropriately configured to avoid unauthorized\
    \ message insertion.\n"
