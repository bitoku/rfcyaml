  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)\
    \ protocol, a\n   system floods its link-state information in Link State PDU (LSP)\
    \ Data\n   Units, or LSPs for short.  These logical LSPs can become quite large,\n\
    \   therefore the protocol specifies a means of fragmenting this\n   information\
    \ into multiple LSP fragments.  The number of fragments a\n   system can generate\
    \ is limited by ISO/IEC 10589 [ISIS-ISO] to 256\n   fragments, where each fragment's\
    \ size is also limited.  Hence, there\n   is a limit on the amount of link-state\
    \ information a system can\n   generate.\n   A number of factors can contribute\
    \ to exceeding this limit:\n   -  Introduction of new TLVs and sub-TLVs to be\
    \ included in LSPs.\n   -  The use of LSPs to propagate various types of information\
    \ (such as\n      traffic-engineering information).\n   -  The increasing number\
    \ of destinations and AS topologies.\n   -  Finer granularity routing, and the\
    \ ability to inject external\n      routes into areas [DOMAIN-WIDE].\n   -  Other\
    \ emerging technologies, such as optical, IPv6, etc.\n   This document describes\
    \ mechanisms to relax the limit on the number\n   of LSP fragments.\n"

- title: 1.3.  Operation Modes
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Operation Modes\n   Two administrative operation modes are provided:\n\
    \   -  Operation Mode 1 provides behavior that allows implementations\n      that\
    \ don't support this extension, to correctly process the\n      extended fragment\
    \ information, without any modifications.  This\n      mode has some restrictions\
    \ on what may be advertised in the\n      extended LSP fragments.  Namely, only\
    \ leaf information may be\n      advertised in the extended LSPs.\n   -  Operation\
    \ Mode 2 extends the previous mode and relaxes its\n      advertisement restrictions.\
    \  Any link-state information may be\n      advertised in the extended LSPs. \
    \ However, it mandates a change to\n      the way LSPs are considered during the\
    \ SPF algorithm, in a way\n      that is not compatible with previous implementations.\n\
    \   These modes are configured on a per-level and area basis.  That is,\n   all\
    \ LSPs considered in the same SPF instance MUST use the same Mode.\n   There is\
    \ no restriction that an L1/L2 IS operates in the same mode,\n   for both its\
    \ L1 and L2 instances.  It can use Mode 1 for its L1 LSPs,\n   and Mode 2 for\
    \ its L2 LSPs, or vice versa.\n   Mode 1 has the only advantage of being backwards\
    \ compatible with\n   older implementations.  It does have restrictions which\
    \ are\n   considered drawbacks.  Therefore, routers should operate in Mode 1\n\
    \   only if backwards compatibility is desired.  Otherwise, it is\n   recommended\
    \ to run in Mode 2.\n   Routers MAY implement Operational Mode 2 without supporting\
    \ running\n   in Operational Mode 1.  They will still interoperate correctly with\n\
    \   routers that support both modes.\n"
- title: 1.4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Overview\n   Using Additional system-ids assigned by the administrator,\
    \ the\n   Originating System can advertise the excess link-state information in\n\
    \   extended LSPs under these Additional system-ids.  It would do so as\n   if\
    \ other routers, or \"Virtual Systems\", were advertising this\n   information.\
    \  These extended LSPs will also have the specified limit\n   on their LSP fragments;\
    \ however, the Originating System may generate\n   extended LSPs under numerous\
    \ Virtual Systems.\n   For Operation Mode 1, 0-cost adjacencies are advertised\
    \ from the\n   Originating System to its Virtual System(s).  No adjacencies (other\n\
    \   than back to the Originating System) are advertised in the extended\n   LSPs.\
    \  As a consequence, the Virtual Systems are 'stub', meaning they\n   can only\
    \ be reached through their Originating System.  Therefore,\n   older implementations\
    \ do not need modifications in order to correctly\n   process these extended LSPs.\n\
    \   For both modes, each LSP (set) created by a node will contain in its\n   fragment-0\
    \ a new TLV (IS Alias ID TLV) that contains the Normal\n   system-id and PN Number\
    \ of the Original LSP created by the router.\n   Extension-capable ISs can then\
    \ use this information and store the\n   original and extended LSPs as one logical\
    \ LSP.\n   The only sections that deal only with Mode 1 additions are 3.2,\n \
    \  3.2.1, and 3.2.2.  All other sections relate to both modes.\n"

    \ Additional system-id), are empty as well.  This is to\n   ensure implementations\
    \ consider the fragments in their SPF\n   computations, as specified in section\
    \ 7.2.5.\n   In Operational Mode 1, when all the extended LSP fragments of a\n\
    \   particular Additional system-id S' have been purged, the Originating\n   System\
    \ SHOULD remove the neighbor information to S' from its original\n   LSPs.\n"

  - "5.  Modifications to LSP handling in SPF\n   This section describes modifications\
    \ to the way extension-capable ISs\n   handle LSPs for the SPF computation.\n\
    \   When considering LSPs of an extension-capable IS (identified by the\n   inclusion\
    \ of the IS Alias ID TLV), the original and extended LSPs are\n   combined to\
    \ form one large logical LSP.  If the LSP belongs to an IS\n   running Operational\
    \ Mode 1, there might be adjacencies between the\n   original and extended LSPs.\
    \  These are trivially ignored (since when\n   processing them the large logical\
    \ LSP is already on PATHS), and does\n   not complicate the SPF.  Furthermore,\
    \ this check should already be\n   implemented (this scenario could occur on error,\
    \ without this\n   extension).\n   If LSP fragment 0 of the Original LSP set is\
    \ missing or its\n   RemainingLifetime is zero, all of the LSPs generated by that\n\
    \   Originating System (Extended as well) MUST NOT be considered in the\n   SPF.\
    \  That is, the large logical LSP is not considered in the SPF.\n   The original\
    \ LSP fragments are identified when the is-alias-id value\n   is the same as the\
    \ system-id of those LSPs.  If an LSP fragment 0 of\n   an extended LSP set is\
    \ missing or its RemainingLifetime is zero, only\n   that LSP set MUST NOT be\
    \ considered in the SPF.  These rules are\n   present to ensure consistent SPF\
    \ results on Mode 1 and Mode 2 LSPs.\n   Note, that the above behavior is consistent\
    \ with how previous\n   implementations will interpret Mode 1 LSPs.\n"
- title: 6.  Forming Adjacencies
  contents:
  - "6.  Forming Adjacencies\n   It should be noted, that an IS MUST use the system-id\
    \ of the LSP that\n   will include a neighbor, when forming an adjacency with\
    \ that\n   neighbor.  That is, if a neighbor is to be included in extended LSP\n\
    \   S', then S' should be used as the system-id in IS Hellos [3] and IS-\n   IS\
    \ Hellos when forming an adjacency with that neighbor.  This is\n   regardless\
    \ of the Operational Mode.  Of course, in Mode 1 this means\n   that only the\
    \ Normal system-id will be used when sending hellos.\n"
- title: 7.  Interoperating between extension-capable and non-extension-capable
  contents:
  - "7.  Interoperating between extension-capable and non-extension-capable\n    ISs.\n\
    \   In order to correctly advertise link-state information under\n   Operation\
    \ Mode 2, all ISs in an area must be extension-capable.\n   However, it is possible\
    \ to not upgrade every router in the network,\n   if the extended information\
    \ is not routing information, but rather\n   data that is of use to only a subset\
    \ of routers (e.g., optical\n   switches using IS-IS could carry optical-specific\
    \ information in\n   extended LSPs)\n   If a live network contains routers exceeding\
    \ the 256 fragment limit,\n   and for some reason the upgrade has to be done incrementally,\
    \ it is\n   possible to transition the network, using the following steps:\n \
    \  -  Upgrade the routers, one-by-one, to run this extension in\n      Operation\
    \ Mode 1.  The other non-extension-capable routers will\n      interoperate correctly.\n\
    \   -  When all routers are extension-capable, configure them one-by-one\n   \
    \   to run in Operation Mode 2.  All extension-capable routers\n      interoperate\
    \ correctly, regardless of what mode they are run in.\n   Implementations SHOULD\
    \ support a configuration parameter controlling\n   the LSP origination behavior.\
    \  The default value of this parameter\n   SHOULD correspond to the behavior described\
    \ in [ISIS-ISO], i.e.,\n   neither of the two modes described in this document\
    \ should be enabled\n   without explicit configuration when the router software\
    \ is upgraded\n   with this extension.\n"
