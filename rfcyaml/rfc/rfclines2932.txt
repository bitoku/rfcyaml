Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing IP Multicast Routing for IPv4, independent of the specific multicast routing protocol in use.
This MIB describes objects used for managing IP Multicast Routing [16], independent of the specific multicast routing protocol [17 21] in use.
Managed objects specific to particular multicast routing protocols are specified elsewhere.
Similarly, this MIB does not support management of multicast routing for other address families, including IPv6.
Such management may be supported by other MIBs.
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
This MIB module contains one scalar and five tables.
The tables are: (1)  the IP Multicast Route Table containing multicast routing information for IP datagrams sent by particular sources to the IP multicast groups known to a router.
(2)  the IP Multicast Routing Next Hop Table containing information on the next hops for the routing IP multicast datagrams.
Each entry is one of a list of next hops on outgoing interfaces for particular sources sending to a particular multicast group address.
(3)  the IP Multicast Routing Interface Table containing multicast routing information specific to interfaces.
(4)  the IP Multicast Scope Boundary Table containing the boundaries configured for multicast scopes [22].
(5)  the IP Multicast Scope Name Table containing human readable names of multicast scope.

The MIB module for management of IP Multicast routing, but independent of the specific multicast routing protocol in use."
This restriction is intended to make the lexical ordering imposed by SNMP useful when applied to language tags.
Note that it is theoretically possible for a valid language tag to exceed the allowed length of this syntax, and thus be impossible to represent with this syntax.
Sampling of language tags in current use on the Internet suggests that this limit does not pose a serious problem in practice.

IpMRouteEntry MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
An entry (conceptual row) containing the multicast routing information for IP datagrams from a particular source and addressed to a particular IP multicast group address.
Discontinuities in counters in this entry can be detected by observing the value of ipMRouteUpTime.

IpAddress MAX ACCESS not accessible STATUS
current DESCRIPTION "The network mask which when combined with the corresponding value of ipMRouteSource identifies the sources for which this entry contains multicast routing information."
"The address of the upstream neighbor (e.g., RPF neighbor) from which IP datagrams from these sources to this multicast address are received, or 0.0.0.0 if the upstream neighbor is unknown (e.g., in CBT)."
"The value of ifIndex for the interface on which IP datagrams sent by these sources to this multicast address are received.
A value of 0 indicates that datagrams are not subject to an incoming interface check, but may be accepted on multiple interfaces (e.g., in CBT)."
The minimum amount of time remaining before this entry will be aged out.
The value 0 indicates that the entry is not subject to aging."
"The number of packets which this router has received from these sources and addressed to this multicast group address, which were dropped because they were not received on the interface indicated by ipMRouteInIfIndex.
Packets which are not subject to an incoming interface check (e.g., using CBT) are not counted."
"The multicast routing protocol via which this multicast forwarding entry was learned."
"The routing mechanism via which the route used to find the upstream or parent interface for this multicast forwarding entry was learned.
Inclusion of values for routing protocols is not intended to imply that those protocols need be supported."
The mask associated with the route used to find the upstream or parent interface for this multicast forwarding entry."
"The reason the given route was placed in the (logical) multicast Routing Information Base (RIB).
A value of unicast means that the route would normally be placed only in the unicast RIB, but was placed in the multicast RIB (instead or in addition) due to local configuration, such as when running PIM over RIP.
A value of multicast means that the route was explicitly added to the multicast RIB by the routing protocol, such as DVMRP or Multiprotocol BGP."

If ipMRouteNextHopState is pruned(1), the remaining time until the prune expires and the state reverts to forwarding(2).

OBJECT GROUP OBJECTS { ipMRouteRtProto, ipMRouteRtAddress, ipMRouteRtMask, ipMRouteRtType } STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
The ipMRouteRtProto, ipMRouteNextHopProtocol, ipMRouteInterfaceProtocol, and ipMRouteProtocol use textual conventions imported from the IANA RTPROTO MIB.
The purpose of defining these textual conventions in a separate MIB module is to allow additional values to be defined without having to issue a new version of this document.
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for the assignment of all Internet numbers, including various SNMP related numbers; it will administer the values associated with these textual conventions.
The rules for additions or changes to the IANA RTPROTO MIB are outlined in the DESCRIPTION clause associated with its MODULE  IDENTITY statement.
The current versions of the IANA RTPROTO MIB can be accessed from the IANA home page at: "http://www.iana.org/".
This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information related to multicast routing, including information on what machines are sending to which groups.
There are also a number of objects that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create, such as those which allow an administrator to configure multicast boundaries.
While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively innocuous, unauthorized access to the write
able objects could cause a denial of service, or could cause wider distribution of packets intended only for local distribution.
Hence, the support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
by itself is such an insecure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and SET (change/create/delete)
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View based Access Control Model RFC 2575
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
