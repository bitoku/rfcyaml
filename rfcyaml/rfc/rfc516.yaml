- title: 'The first scheme:'
  contents:
  - "The first scheme:\n    If upon sending a message the host saved a copy of that\
    \ message and\n    waited until either:\n        a RFNM was returned, in which\
    \ case everything is ok and the next\n        message is processed.\n        a\
    \ INCOMPLETE TRANSMISSION is returned, in which case the copy of\n        the\
    \ message is retransmitted (this could be a loop so put a\n        finite upper\
    \ bound on the number of times to retransmit the same\n        message).\n   \
    \     a DESTINATION DEAD is returned, in which case mark the\n        destination\
    \ down and require the exchange of reset commands\n        before further communication\
    \ is allowed.\n        something else is received indicating an error in the network\
    \ or\n        local IMP, in which case at least log the error, and probably\n\
    \        close the conversation.\n    Following the above procedures either on\
    \ a per host basis or a per\n    link basis should prevent a lost message problem\
    \ from\n    developing.\n"
- title: 'The second scheme:'
  contents:
  - "The second scheme:\n    If on a per host basis, message numbers are included\
    \ in the host to\n    host header of messages,, and messages are delivered in\
    \ order (this\n    is currently the case in the network, except for priority messages\n\
    \    so this proposal requires that each host either send everything as\n    priority\
    \ or nothing as priority) then each receiving host can detect\n    a missing message\
    \ by comparing the message number of the received\n    message with the previously\
    \ received message.\n        On exchanging resets the sequence numbers between\
    \ that pair of\n        hosts is set to zero.\n        Each time a message is\
    \ sent the current send message number is\n        entered into a field in the\
    \ message header, and the current send\n        message number is incremented\
    \ (modulo N, say N=256)\n        Each time a message is received the message number\
    \ from the\n        message is compared to the current receive message number\
    \ and:\n            if the received message is the expected one then the message\n\
    \            is acceptable and current receive message number is\n           \
    \ incremented (modulo N);\n            if the received message is not the expected\
    \ one then a\n            message has been lost.\n    What to do when a missing\
    \ message is detected, not clear, but at\n    least can be logged and reported\
    \ to the network control center.  A\n    missing message may not be fatal to an\
    \ interactive conversation, but\n    it is critical in a file transfer, thus I\
    \ suggest that missing\n    messages which are not recovered be cause to close\
    \ the conversation.\n"
- title: 'The third scheme:'
  contents:
  - "The third scheme:\n    Host to host acknowledgements could be required.  Such\
    \ an\n    acknowledgement scheme could be implemented similarly to the IMP to\n\
    \    IMP scheme.  This is a serious change to the current protocols so I\n   \
    \ will not elaborate on it here, feeling that deeper study will be\n    necessary\
    \ to fully specify a reasonable host to host acknowledgement\n    strategy.\n"
