  - '1.2.  Changes to Existing RFC 2705 Packages

    '
- title: 1.2.1.  Change in signal types
  contents:
  - "1.2.1.  Change in signal types\n   MGCP 1.0, as defined in RFC 2705 [38] (and\
    \ now updated in [1]),\n   provided some additional clarification on the meaning\
    \ of On-Off (OO)\n   signals compared to earlier versions of MGCP.  This lead\
    \ to some\n   inconsistency in some of the signal definitions in the accompanying\n\
    \   packages in RFC 2705 [38].  This has been corrected in the packages\n   that\
    \ are included here by changing some of the signals from type On-\n   Off to type\
    \ Time-Out (TO).\n"
- title: 1.2.2.  Operation Complete and Operation Failure
  contents:
  - "1.2.2.  Operation Complete and Operation Failure\n   Another change made to improve\
    \ consistency and interoperability was\n   to add the \"operation complete\" and\
    \ \"operation failure\" events in\n   packages where there are TO signals defined,\
    \ but where the \"operation\n   complete\" and \"operation failure\" events were\
    \ not previously included\n   as part of the package.  By definition, all packages\
    \ that contain\n   Time-Out type signals now contain the \"operation failure\"\
    \ (\"of\") and\n   \"operation complete\" (\"oc\") events as defined in [1], irrespective\
    \ of\n   whether they are provided as part of the package description or not.\n\
    \   If a package without Time-Out signals contains definitions for the\n   \"\
    oc\" and \"of\" events, the event definitions provided in the package\n   may\
    \ over-ride those indicated here.  Such practice is however\n   discouraged and\
    \ is purely allowed to avoid potential backwards\n   compatibility problems.\n\
    \   It is considered good practice to explicitly mention that the \"oc\"\n   and\
    \ \"of\" events are supported in accordance with their default\n   definitions.\
    \  If no definition is included in the package, the\n   default syntax and semantics\
    \ are assumed.\n   Please refer to [1] for additional details on these events.\n"
- title: 1.2.3.  Package Versions
  contents:
  - "1.2.3.  Package Versions\n   The generic, line, trunk, handset, RTP, DTMF, announcement\
    \ server and\n   script packages included in this document are new versions of\n\
    \   packages that were previously contained in RFC 2705 [38].  The\n   updated\
    \ base MGCP 1.0 specification [1] provides an optional\n   capability of auditing\
    \ package versions.  Any gateway that implements\n   versioned packages SHOULD\
    \ also implement this option.\n"
- title: 1.2.4.  Event Definitions, Aliases and Interoperability Issues
  contents:
  - "1.2.4.  Event Definitions, Aliases and Interoperability Issues\n   Some event\
    \ definitions or clarifications of previous event\n   definitions have also been\
    \ added in order to improve\n   interoperability.\n   In some cases, events have\
    \ aliases either in the same or in other\n   packages and a recommendation has\
    \ been made for the use of alternates\n   by Call Agents for future implementations.\
    \  For maximum\n   interoperability, gateways MUST still implement these events\
    \ (in fact\n   they MUST always implement all of the events, signals, etc. in\
    \ a\n   package).\n   Some events that were previously defined require specific\n\
    \   provisioning in both the gateway and the Call Agent in order to allow\n  \
    \ for interoperability.  In those cases, a warning to that affect has\n   been\
    \ included.\n"
- title: 1.2.5.  New Events
  contents:
  - "1.2.5.  New Events\n   In some cases, new events have been added to existing\
    \ packages.  Any\n   changes to existing packages of course have resulted in the\
    \ package\n   version number being updated from unversioned (version 0) to version\n\
    \   1.\n"
- title: 1.3.  New Packages and Excluded Packages
  contents:
  - "1.3.  New Packages and Excluded Packages\n   Two packages from RFC 2705 [38]\
    \ have not been included.  These are\n   the \"MF\" and the \"NAS\" packages.\
    \  These packages are still valid as\n   are all unversioned (version 0) packages\
    \ defined in RFC 2705 [38].\n   The reason these packages were not included are:\n\
    \      *  The original MF package had no defined way to outpulse MF\n        \
    \ digits so that MF CAS is now provided by other packages (i.e.,\n         the\
    \ \"MS\", \"MO\" and \"MD\" packages) in a separate document.\n      *  The \"\
    N\" package, as defined in RFC 2705 [38], was incomplete.\n         A new MGCP\
    \ \"NAS\" package has been developed and provided in a\n         separate document.\n\
    \   New packages have also been included beyond what was included in RFC\n   2705\
    \ [38].  These are the signal list, resource reservation, media\n   format, supplementary\
    \ services and digit map extension packages.  The\n   Resource Reservation (\"\
    RES\") and Media Format (\"FM\") packages in\n   particular are different from\
    \ other packages in this document in that\n   they contain new LocalConnectionOptions.\
    \  This is allowed by the new\n   extension rules in [1].  Future packages of\
    \ this type MUST use a\n   packages prefix in front of local connection options\
    \ (\"<package-\n   name>/<Local Connection Option>\") so as to avoid name-space\
    \ problems.\n   However because of the timing of the arrival of these packages\n\
    \   relative to updating MGCP 1.0, this was not done for the \"RES\" and\n   \"\
    FM\" packages.  The resulting new local connection options have been\n   registered\
    \ with IANA.  For future cases where a package prefix is\n   included, only the\
    \ package name needs to be registered.\n"
- title: 2.  Packages
  contents:
  - "2.  Packages\n   For those packages that involve MGCP events, the terms \"signal\"\
    \ and\n   \"event\" are used to differentiate a request from a Call Agent to a\n\
    \   Media Gateway to apply an event (\"signal\"), from the request for the\n \
    \  detection of an \"event\" that occurs on the Media Gateway and is\n   \"Notified\"\
    \ to the Call Agent.\n   For packages that involve events and signals, the tables\
    \ contain five\n   columns:\n      Symbol:  the (package) unique symbol used to\
    \ identify the event.\n      Definition:   a short description of the event.\n\
    \      R:  an x appears in this column if the event can be requested by\n    \
    \  the Call Agent.  Alternatively, one or more of the following\n      symbols\
    \ may appear.  An \"S\" is included if the event-state may be\n      audited.\
    \  A \"C\" indicates that the event can be detected on a\n      connection, and\
    \ a \"P\" indicates the event is persistent.\n      S: if nothing appears in this\
    \ column for an event, then the event\n      cannot be signaled by the Call Agent.\
    \  Otherwise, the following\n      symbols identify the type of event:\n     \
    \    * OO     On/Off signal\n         * TO     Time-Out signal.\n         * BR\
    \     Brief signal.\n      In addition, a \"C\" will be included if the signal\
    \ can be generated\n      on a connection.\n      Duration: specifies the default\
    \ duration of TO signals.  If a\n      duration is left unspecified, then the\
    \ default timeout will be\n      assumed to be infinite, unless explicitly noted\
    \ in the description\n      of the signal.  A duration may also be declared as\
    \ being variable\n      in a case where signals involve complex sequencing (e.g.,\
    \ scripts\n      or digit out-pulsing) where the amount of time may vary with\n\
    \      either processing time or the signaling environment.\n   Default time-out\
    \ values may be over-ridden by the Call Agent for any\n   Time-Out event defined\
    \ in this document (with the exception of those\n   that have a default value\
    \ of \"variable\") by a \"to\" signal parameter\n   which specifies the timeout\
    \ value in milliseconds (see [1]).  The\n   following example indicates a timeout\
    \ value of 20 seconds:\n         S: sst/cw(to=20000)\n   As indicated in [1]:\
    \ by default, a supplied time-out value MAY be\n   rounded to the nearest non-zero\
    \ value divisible by 1000, i.e., whole\n   second.  However, individual signal\
    \ definitions within a package may\n   define other rounding rules.\n   Note that\
    \ Time-Out signals that involve other parameters still allow\n   the use of the\
    \ \"to\" signal parameter e.g.:\n         S: T/sit(1,to=3000)\n   The order of\
    \ the \"to\" parameter relative to the other parameters is\n   not important.\n\
    \   Note: as per [1], On-Off (OO) signals are parameterized with \"+\"\n   (meaning\
    \ turn on) or \"-\" (meaning turn off).  If the parameter is\n   missing, the\
    \ default is to turn on the signal.  Unlike Time-Out\n   signals, On-Off signals\
    \ do not stop when an event occurs.\n   Other than the \"to\" parameter for Time-out\
    \ (TO) signals and the \"+\"\n   and \"-\" for On-Off (OO) signals, signals and\
    \ events in the packages\n   in this document do not have parameters unless explicitly\
    \ indicated\n   in the description of the event for that package.\n   In some\
    \ of the signal definitions below, specific tone definitions\n   are provided\
    \ even though actual frequencies may vary from country to\n   country.\n"

    \   New events added to this package from the previously unversioned\n   package:\
    \ \"oc\"\n   Changes: \"it\" and \"pt\" signals changed from OO to TO.\n   Note\
    \ that default time-out values may be over-ridden by the Call\n   Agent for any\
    \ Time-Out signal defined in this package by a \"to\"\n   signal parameter.  Refer\
    \ to section 2 of this document, as well as\n   [1] for details.\n   The events\
    \ and signals are defined as follows:\n   Confirmation Tone (cf):\n      This\
    \ is also referred to as \"positive indication tone\" in ITU-T\n      E.182. \
    \ In North America, Confirmation Tone uses the same\n      frequencies and levels\
    \ as dial tone (350 and 440 Hertz) but with a\n      cadence of 0.1 second on,\
    \ 0.1 second off, repeated three times.\n      See GR-506-CORE [7] Section 17.2.4.\
    \  It is considered an error to\n      try and play confirmation tone on a phone\
    \ that is on-hook and an\n      error MUST consequently be returned when such\
    \ attempts are made\n      (error code 402 - phone on-hook).\n   Congestion Tone\
    \ (cg):\n      Refer to ITU-T E.180 [8] and E.182 [10].  This maps to re-order\n\
    \      tone in North America (refer to GR-506-CORE [7] Section 17.2.7).\n   Fax\
    \ Tone (ft):\n      The fax tone event is generated whenever a fax call is detected\
    \ by\n      the presence of V.21 fax preamble.  The fax tone event SHOULD also\n\
    \      be generated when the T.30 CNG tone is detected.  See ITU-T\n      Recommendations\
    \ T.30 [21] and V.21 [22].\n   Intercept Tone(it):\n      This is a country specific\
    \ tone as defined in ITU-T E.180\n      Supplement 2 [9].\n   Long Duration Connection\
    \ (ld):\n      The \"long duration connection\" is detected when a connection\
    \ has\n      been established for more than a provisioned amount of time.  The\n\
    \      default value is 1 hour.\n      This event is detected on a connection.\
    \  When no connection is\n      specified as part of the request, the event applies\
    \ to all\n      connections for the endpoint, regardless of when the connections\n\
    \      are created.  The \"all connections\" wildcard (see [1]) may also be\n\
    \      used for this case, and is in fact preferred for consistency.  In\n   \
    \   either case, the name of the connection on which the event was\n      detected\
    \ will be included when the event is observed, e.g.:\n         G/ld@0A3F58\n \
    \  Modem Tone (mt):\n      Indicates V.25 Answer tone (ANS) with or without phase\
    \ reversals\n      or V.8 Modified Answer Tone (ANSam) tone with or without phase\n\
    \      reversals.  Note that this implies the presence of a data call.\n     \
    \ Also note that despite the name of the event, devices other than\n      modems\
    \ may generate such tones, e.g., a fax machine.\n   Operation Complete (oc):\n\
    \      The standard definition of operation complete [1].\n   Operation Failure\
    \ (of):\n      The standard definition of operation failure [1].\n   Pattern Detected\
    \ (pat(###)):\n      This event requires special provisioning that needs to be\
    \ agreed\n      on between the Call Agent and media gateway in order to ensure\n\
    \      interoperability.  It is retained in order to maintain backwards\n    \
    \  compatibility with version 0 of the \"G\" package.  This event MUST\n     \
    \ be parameterized with a decimal numeric value from 0 to 999\n      specifying\
    \ the pattern to detect.  When reported, the pattern is\n      also included as\
    \ a parameter.\n   Preemption Tone (pt):\n      This is a country specific tone\
    \ and is defined in ITU-T E.180\n      Supplement 2 [9].\n   Ringback (rbk(connectionID)):\n\
    \      This is an alias for \"rt@connectionID\" and is included here for\n   \
    \   backwards compatibility only.  It is recommended that Call Agents\n      use\
    \ \"rt@connectionID\" instead of \"rbk(connectionID)\" for ring-back\n      over\
    \ a connection for new implementations.  Although the ringback\n      signal is\
    \ applied on a connection, the \"rbk\" signal does not\n      support the \"@connection\"\
    \ syntax.  When the signal is requested,\n      it MUST be parameterized with\
    \ a connection-ID or a connection-ID\n      wildcard as specified in [1].\n  \
    \ Ringback Tone (rt):\n      Refer to ITU-T E.180 [8] and ITU-T E.182 [10].  Also\
    \ referred to\n      as ringing tone - a tone advising the caller that a connection\
    \ has\n      been made and that a calling signal is being applied to the called\n\
    \      party or service point.  In North America, this tone is a\n      combination\
    \ of two AC tones with frequencies of 440 and 480 Hertz\n      and levels of -19\
    \ dBm each, to give a combined level of -16 dBm.\n      The cadence for Audible\
    \ Ring Tone is 2 seconds on, followed by 4\n      seconds off.  See GR-506-CORE\
    \ [7] - LSSGR: SIGNALING, Section\n      17.2.5.\n      This signal can be applied\
    \ directly to an endpoint or\n      alternatively on a connection using the syntax\
    \ \"rt@connectionID\".\n      When the ringback signal is applied to an endpoint,\
    \ it is\n      considered an error to try and play ringback tone if the endpoint\n\
    \      is considered on-hook, and an error MUST consequently be returned\n   \
    \   when such attempts are made (error code 402 - phone on-hook).\n      When\
    \ the ringback signal is applied to a connection, no such check\n      is to be\
    \ made.\n      Note that as specified in [1], signals requested on a connection\n\
    \      MUST be played regardless of the connection mode.  For example, in\n  \
    \    a call-waiting situation, ringback tone may be played on a\n      connection\
    \ in \"inactive\" mode.\n"

    \   Changes from the previous version of the package: events \"dd\", \"do\",\n\
    \   \"oc\" were added.\n   Note that DTMF tones including the DTMF tones wildcard\
    \ can use the\n   eventRange notation defined in [1] when requesting events, e.g.,\n\
    \   \"D/[0-9](N)\".\n   Note that default time-out values may be over-ridden by\
    \ the Call\n   Agent for any Time-Out signal defined in this package by a \"to\"\
    \n   signal parameter.  Refer to section 2 of this document, as well as\n   [1]\
    \ for details.\n   The events are defined as follows:\n   DTMF tones (0-9,#,*,A,B,C,D):\n\
    \      Detection and generation of DTMF tones is described in GR-506-CORE\n  \
    \    [7] - LSSGR: SIGNALING, Section 15.  Note that it is considered an\n    \
    \  error to try and play DTMF tones on a phone that is on-hook and an\n      error\
    \ MUST consequently be returned when such attempts are made\n      (error code\
    \ 402 - phone on-hook).  The event codes can be\n      specified in a digit map.\
    \  When requested as a signal, as per\n      GR-506-CORE [7], section 15, a minimum\
    \ tone duration of 50 ms will\n      be followed by a minimum interdigit silence\
    \ period of 45 ms, i.e.,\n      if requested in a signal list such as \"S: sl/s(d/5,d/6,d/7)\"\
    , then\n      interdigit timing requirements will be satisfied.\n      Note that\
    \ some types of endpoints, such as announcement endpoints,\n      MAY allow detection\
    \ and/or generation of a DTMF tone over a\n      connection.  However, this requires\
    \ consistent provisioning\n      between the Call Agent and announcement server\
    \ (it is not required\n      in order to be compliant with the DTMF package).\n\
    \   DTMF Tone Duration (dd(dg=<tone>,to=<time>,su=<TrueOrFalse>)):\n      This\
    \ event can be used to indicate if/when the specified <tone>\n      has a duration\
    \ greater than the <time> value indicated (and is\n      reported once the duration\
    \ is exceeded).  The parameters can be\n      supplied in any order.  The value\
    \ of <tone> can be any of the DTMF\n      tone symbols (without including the\
    \ package name) specified in the\n      DTMF package (including X in the case\
    \ of events, but not signals).\n      If this parameter is absent, any DTMF tone\
    \ that occurs will be\n      reported.  The parameter <time> is in milli-seconds\
    \ and may be\n      rounded to the nearest 10 ms by the gateway.  The minimum\
    \ value of\n      <time> that can be requested when requesting an event is 40\
    \ ms.\n      When requesting a signal, the minimum value of <time> that can be\n\
    \      requested is 50 ms.  The maximum value of <time> that can be\n      requested\
    \ for either an event or a signal is 60000 ms.  If the\n      \"to=<time>\" parameter\
    \ is absent when requested as an event, the\n      event will report the full\
    \ duration (up to 60000 ms) of the tone\n      when the tone is completed.  When\
    \ reported as an ObservedEvent,\n      both parameters are always supplied.  In\
    \ this case, <tone> is the\n      actual tone detected and <time> is either:\n\
    \         *  The <time> specified in the request (possibly rounded), or\n    \
    \     *  If the request did not contain a \"to=<time>\" parameter, the\n     \
    \       full duration of the tone.\n      The parameter \"su\" MAY be included\
    \ when this is requested as an\n      event (but is not reported).  This parameter\
    \ is used to indicate\n      whether or not the DTMF digits requested should be\
    \ suppressed\n      in-band when it is requested.  Possible values are \"true\"\
    ,\n      indicating that in-band DTMF should be suppressed and \"false\"\n   \
    \   indicating that DTMF should continue to be passed in-band.  The\n      default\
    \ value of the parameter, if missing, is \"false\".  The \"su\"\n      parameter\
    \ MUST NOT be included when requesting \"D/dd\" as a signal.\n      When used\
    \ as a signal, \"dd\" provides the ability to generate a\n      DTMF tone as a\
    \ TO signal.  When applied as a signal, an additional\n      50 ms of silence\
    \ will be tacked onto the end before the operation\n      complete occurs, i.e.,\
    \ \"S: dd(dg=5,to=2500)\" will play the DTMF\n      tone for the number \"5\"\
    \ for 2.5 seconds, followed by 50 ms of\n      silence period.  The operation\
    \ complete (if requested) will be\n      notified after the silence interval occurs.\
    \  Any value from 50 ms\n      to 60000 ms can be requested.  Gateways generating\
    \ or detecting\n      the tone may round off the requested time to the nearest\
    \ 10 ms.\n      The \"dd\" event can be used in place of the \"long duration\"\
    \ event\n      in order to detect a digit pressed for longer than 2 seconds. \
    \ For\n      example, in order to detect if a user presses the long \"#\" for\n\
    \      longer than 2 seconds, a request could be made with the\n      RequestedEvents\
    \ line \"R: d/dd(N)(dg=#,to=2000)\".  The resulting\n      ObservedEvents line\
    \ would be \"O: d/dd(dg=#,to=2000)\".\n      Suppose instead, that the RequestedEvents\
    \ line contains\n         R: d/[0-9*#],d/dd\n      Suppose the user then pushes\
    \ the \"#\" for 2.5 seconds.  In this\n      case, two events will be notified:\n\
    \         O: d/#\n      when the \"#\" key is first pressed, and\n         O:\
    \ d/dd(dg=#,to=2500)\n      when the \"#\" key is finally released.\n   DTMF OO\
    \ Signal (do(dg=<tone>,<on-or-off>)):\n      This signal is used to generate a\
    \ DTMF tone as an on-off signal.\n      The <tone> parameter is any of the symbols\
    \ for a specific tone in\n      the DTMF package (i.e., \"0\" to \"9\", \"A\"\
    , \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"*\", or\n      \"#\").  The <on-or-off> indicator is\
    \ \"+\" for on and \"-\" for off as\n      per [1].  The <tone> parameter MUST\
    \ be supplied, otherwise a\n      return code of 538 - \"Event/signal parameter\
    \ error\" will be\n      provided in the response.  If the <on-or-off> parameter\
    \ is\n      missing, the default is to turn the signal on as usual (i.e., \"+\"\
    \n      is the default).  The order of the parameters is not significant\n   \
    \   since \"+\" and \"-\" are reserved characters and are easily\n      distinguished\
    \ from the <tone> parameter.\n   Long Duration Indicator (l):\n      The \"long\
    \ duration indicator\" is observed when a DTMF signal is\n      produced for a\
    \ duration larger than two seconds.  In this case,\n      the gateway will detect\
    \ two successive events: first, when the\n      signal has been recognized, the\
    \ DTMF signal, and then, 2 seconds\n      later, the long duration signal.\n \
    \  Operation Complete (oc):\n      This is the standard definition of operation\
    \ complete [1].\n   Operation Failure (of):\n      This is the standard definition\
    \ of operation failure [1].\n   Timer (t):\n      Timer T can be used as an event\
    \ or as a time-out (TO) signal.  As\n      a signal, its only behavior is the\
    \ normal characteristics of a\n      \"TO\" signal as defined in [1] (i.e., if\
    \ no event occurs before the\n      time-out, an operation complete event will\
    \ be generated).\n      As an event, Timer T is a digit input timer that can be\
    \ used in\n      two ways:\n         *  When timer T is used with the accumulate\
    \ according to digit\n            map action, the timer is not started until the\
    \ first DTMF\n            tone is entered, and the timer is restarted after each\
    \ new\n            DTMF tone is entered until either a digit map match or\n  \
    \          mismatch occurs.  In this case, timer T functions as an\n         \
    \   inter-digit timer as illustrated by:\n               R: D/[0-9T](D)\n    \
    \     *  When timer T is used without the \"accumulate according to\n        \
    \    digit map\" action, the timer is started immediately and\n            simply\
    \ cancelled (but not restarted) as soon as a DTMF tone\n            is entered.\
    \  In this case, timer T can be used as an inter-\n            digit timer when\
    \ overlap sending is used, as in:\n               R: D/[0-9](N), D/T(N)\n    \
    \  When used with the \"accumulate according to digit map\" action,\n      timer\
    \ T takes on one of two values, T-partial or T-critical.  When\n      at least\
    \ one more symbol is required for the \"current dial string\"\n      to match\
    \ any one of the patterns in the digit map, timer T takes\n      on the value\
    \ T-partial, corresponding to partial dial timing.  If\n      a timer is all that\
    \ is required to produce a match, timer T takes\n      on the value T-critical\
    \ corresponding to critical dial timing.\n      When timer T is used without the\
    \ \"accumulate according to digit\n      map\" action, timer T takes on the value\
    \ T-critical.  The default\n      value for T-partial is 16 seconds and the default\
    \ value for\n      T-critical is 4 seconds.  The provisioning process may alter\
    \ both\n      of these.  If timer T is not used, then inter-digit timing will\n\
    \      not be performed.\n      The following examples illustrate this.  Consider\
    \ the digit map:\n         (xxxxxxx|x11T)\n      and assume that DTMF and the\
    \ timer T is accumulated according to\n      digit map.  At the first DTMF input,\
    \ say \"4\", timer T is started\n      with a value of T-partial since at least\
    \ one more symbol is\n      required.  If \"1\" is then input, it leads to a restart\
    \ of timer T\n      with a value of T-partial again.  If \"1\" is now input again,\
    \ we\n      have a current dial string of \"411\" and a timer is now all that\
    \ is\n      required to produce a match.  Hence timer T is now restarted with\n\
    \      value T-critical.\n      Finally, consider the following subtle examples\
    \ (all assuming DTMF\n      and timer T being accumulated according to digit map):\n\
    \      The digit map\n         (1[2-3T].)\n      will match immediately on the\
    \ input \"1\" since zero or more matches\n      of the range are specified.\n\
    \      The digit map\n         (1[2-3].T)\n      and an input of \"1\" will lead\
    \ to timer T being set to T-critical.\n      A digit map of\n         (1[2-3]T.)\n\
    \      and an input of \"1\" will lead to timer T being set to T-partial.\n  \
    \    Furthermore, upon subsequent input of \"2\" or \"3\" a perfect match\n  \
    \    will be triggered immediately since timer T is completely\n      irrelevant.\n\
    \   DTMF Tones Wildcard (X):\n      The DTMF tones wildcard matches any DTMF digit\
    \ between 0 and 9.\n      The actual event code generated will however be the\
    \ event code for\n      the digit detected.  The DTMF tones wildcard is often\
    \ used to\n      detect DTMF input to be matched against a digit map.\n"

    \   New events added to this package from the previously unversioned\n   package:\
    \ \"bz\", \"ct\", \"mm\", \"oc\", \"pst\", \"qt\", \"sit\", and \"tp\".\n   Changes\
    \ in event types: \"co1\", \"co2\", \"nm\", \"om\", \"tl\", \"zz\" signals\n \
    \  changed from OO to TO; \"as\" and \"bl\" changed from OO to BR.\n   Note that\
    \ default time-out values may be over-ridden by the Call\n   Agent for any Time-Out\
    \ signal defined in this package by a \"to\"\n   signal parameter.  Refer to section\
    \ 2 of this document, as well as\n   [1] for details.\n   The definition of the\
    \ trunk package events are as follows:\n   Answer Supervision (as):\n      This\
    \ event is used to indicate the occurrence answer supervision.\n      In most\
    \ cases, it is a result of a steady off-hook in response to\n      a call request.\
    \  This event is included for backwards\n      compatibility with the previous\
    \ version of the package.  The\n      preferred alternative is to use the \"answer\"\
    \ event in the\n      appropriate CAS packages [34] (Note: check the details on\
    \ the use\n      of \"answer\" in the particular CAS package; in most cases \"\
    answer\"\n      as an event is an indication of a steady off-hook regardless of\n\
    \      whether or not it is an indication of answer supervision).  For\n     \
    \ details on when answer supervision is appropriate refer to [5].\n   Blocking\
    \ (bl):\n      This event is used to indicate an incoming off-hook for the\n \
    \     purposes of blocking a one-way trunk in CAS trunks.  This event is\n   \
    \   included for backwards compatibility with the previous version of\n      the\
    \ package.  The preferred alternative is the \"block\" event in\n      the appropriate\
    \ CAS packages [34].\n   Busy Tone (bz):\n      Refer to ITU-T E.180 [8].  In\
    \ North America, station Busy is a\n      combination of two AC tones with frequencies\
    \ of 480 and 620 Hertz\n      and levels of -24 dBm each, to give a combined level\
    \ of -21 dBm.\n      The cadence for Station Busy Tone is 0.5 seconds on, followed\
    \ by\n      0.5 seconds off, then repeating.  See GR-506-CORE [7]- LSSGR:\n  \
    \    SIGNALING, Section 17.2.6.\n   Continuity Tone (co1):\n      A tone at 2010\
    \ Hz (see section 3.1.1.3 of [2]).  When generated as\n      a signal, the frequency\
    \ of the tone must be within + or - 8 Hz,\n      while the frequency of the tone\
    \ corresponding to the event must be\n      within + or - 30 Hz.\n   Continuity\
    \ Test (co2):\n      A tone at 1780 Hz (see section 3.1.1.3 of [2]).  When generated\
    \ as\n      a signal, the frequency of the tone must be within + or - 20 Hz,\n\
    \      while the frequency of the tone corresponding to the event must be\n  \
    \    within + or - 30 Hz.\n      In continuity testing the tone corresponding\
    \ to the signal at the\n      originating gateway is referred to as the \"go\"\
    \ tone, and the tone\n      corresponding to the event at that same gateway is\
    \ referred to as\n      the \"return\" or \"check\" tone.\n      Note that generation\
    \ and notification of continuity tones are done\n      as per continuity test\
    \ requirements as defined in ITU-T Q.724 [3],\n      as well as by Bellcore GR-317-CORE\
    \ [2] specifications, i.e., the\n      semantics of notification of the return\
    \ tone is more than that the\n      tone was received, but is an indication that\
    \ the test has passed.\n      Details are provided in the following paragraphs.\n\
    \      The continuity tones represented by co1 and co2 are used when the\n   \
    \   Call Agent wants to initiate a continuity test.  There are two\n      types\
    \ of tests, single tone and dual tone; In the case of the dual\n      tone, either\
    \ tone can be sent and the opposite received depending\n      on the trunk interconnections\
    \ (4-wire or 2-wire) as indicated\n      below:\n         Originating        \
    \                       Terminating\n         ============                   \
    \           ===========\n            4w   -------------- 1780 Hz ----------->\
    \  2w\n                 <------------- 2010 Hz ------------  (transponder)\n \

    \ 2010 Hz ----------->  4w\n                 <------------- 2010 Hz ------------\
    \  (loopback)\n      The Call agent is expected to know, through provisioning\n\
    \      information, which test should be applied to a given endpoint.  As\n  \
    \    an example, for a 4-wire to 2-wire connection, the Call Agent\n      might\
    \ send a request like the following to an originating gateway:\n         RQNT\
    \ 1234 ds/ds1-1/17@tgw2.example.net\n         X: AB123FE0\n         S: t/co1\n\
    \         R: t/co2,t/oc,t/of\n      On a terminating side of a trunk, the call\
    \ agent may request a\n      continuity test connection (connection mode \"conttest\"\
    ) to the\n      terminating gateway as follows:\n         CRCX 3001 ds/ds1-2/4@tgw34.example.net\n\
    \         C: 3748ABC364\n         M: conttest\n      Alternatively, rather than\
    \ using a connection mode, the \"T/ct\"\n      signal can be used (see description\
    \ of this signal further below):\n         RQNT 3001 ds/ds1-2/4@tgw34.example.net\n\
    \         X: 1233472\n         S: t/ct(in=co1,out=co2,+)\n      The originating\
    \ gateway would send the requested \"go\" tone, and\n      would look for the\
    \ appropriate \"return tone\".  Once the return\n      tone is received, the originating\
    \ gateway removes the go tone and\n      checks to see that the return tone has\
    \ been removed within the\n      specified performance limits (i.e., GR-246-CORE,\
    \ T1.113.4, Annex B\n      [23]).  When it detects that the test is successful,\
    \ the gateway\n      will send a notification of the return tone event (Note that\n\
    \      notification of the return tone event therefore must not be sent\n    \
    \  prior to detection of the removal of the return tone).\n      The \"T/co1\"\
    \ and \"T/co2\" signals are TO signals so that an\n      operation complete event\
    \ will occur when the signal times out.  If\n      a timeout value other than\
    \ the default is desired, the \"to\"\n      parameter may be used (e.g., \"S:\
    \ T/co1(to=2000)\").\n      If the gateway detects the failure of the continuity\
    \ test prior to\n      the timeout, an operation failure event will be generated.\n\
    \      Otherwise, the failure of the continuity test is determined by the\n  \
    \    failure to receive the return tone event before the timeout occurs\n    \
    \  (operation complete event).  As with TO signals in general,\n      operation\
    \ complete and operation fail events are parameterized\n      with the name of\
    \ the signal.\n      In the example above where the go tone is \"co1\" and the\
    \ return\n      tone is \"co2\":\n         *  A notification of the \"co2\" event\
    \ indicates success (i.e.,\n            \"O: t/co2\").\n         *  A notification\
    \ of the operation failure event indicates\n            failure prior to timeout\
    \ (i.e., \"O: t/of(t/co1)\").\n         *  A notification of the operation complete\
    \ event indicates\n            that the return tone was not received properly\
    \ prior to the\n            occurrence of the timeout (i.e., \"O: t/oc(t/co2)\"\
    ).\n      On a terminating end of a trunk, either a \"loopback\" connection\n\
    \      (single tone test) or \"conttest\" connection (dual tone test) is\n   \
    \   made (or alternatively the \"T/lb\" or \"T/ct\" signals are\n      requested).\
    \  It is up to the termination end to make sure that the\n      return tone is\
    \ removed as soon as the go tone disappears.  The\n      Call Agent requests the\
    \ removal of \"contest\" or \"loopback\"\n      connections (or \"T/lb\" or \"\
    T/ct\" signals) at a termination end\n      when the results of the continuity\
    \ test are obtained.\n      When \"conttest\" is used, the endpoint is provisioned\
    \ as to which\n      transponder test is being performed (2010 Hz received and\
    \ 1780 Hz\n      sent or vice versa).  In the case of the corresponding \"T/ct\"\
    \n      signal, the Call Agent can specify which tone is received and sent\n \
    \     as parameters.\n      Note that continuity tones in the trunk package are\
    \ only ever sent\n      to the telephony endpoint.  For network-based continuity,\
    \ there\n      are continuity tones available in the RTP (\"R\") package.  Although\n\
    \      a transponder (dual tone) test can be done, a single tone test is\n   \
    \   generally sufficient in the case of continuity testing across an\n      IP\
    \ network.\n   Continuity Transponder(ct(in=<tone-in>,out=<tone-out>, <+ or ->)):\n\
    \      This signal is used to provide transponder functionality\n      independent\
    \ of the connection mode, i.e., this is an alternative\n      way to provide the\
    \ same functionality as the \"conttest\" connection\n      mode.  The parameters\
    \ can be provided in any order.  The <tone-in>\n      and <tone-out> parameters\
    \ can have values \"co1\" or \"co2\",\n      corresponding to the 2010 Hz and\
    \ 1780 Hz tones associated with\n      those symbols.  If one of the tones is\
    \ \"co1\", then the other must\n      be \"co2\" and vice versa (i.e., <tone-in>\
    \ and <tone-out> must have\n      different values; if loopback is required, then\
    \ the \"lb\" signal in\n      this package or \"loopback\" connection mode should\
    \ be used).\n      On detecting <tone-in>, <tone-out> will be generated in return.\n\
    \      The tone corresponding to <tone-out> will continue to be generated\n  \
    \    until either:\n         *  The signal is explicitly turned off (e.g., \"\
    S: t/ct(-)\") or\n         *  Removal of the <tone-in> tone is detected.\n   \
    \   Note that while the signal is active (regardless of whether a tone\n     \
    \ is active or not), media from the endpoint will not be forwarded\n      to or\
    \ from the packet network (i.e., the continuity transponder\n      signal must\
    \ be explicitly turned off by the Call Agent in order to\n      resume passing\
    \ media between the packet network and the endpoint).\n   Loopback (lb):\n   \
    \   This signal is used to provide loopback functionality independent\n      of\
    \ the connection mode, i.e., this is an alternative way to\n      provide the\
    \ same functionality as \"loopback\" connection mode.\n      Note that while the\
    \ loop-back signal is active (regardless of\n      whether a tone is active or\
    \ not), media from the endpoint will not\n      be forwarded to or from the packet\
    \ network (i.e., the loopback\n      signal must be explicitly turned off by the\
    \ Call Agent in order to\n      resume passing media between the packet network\
    \ and the endpoint).\n   New Milliwatt Tone (nm):\n      1004 Hz tone - refer\
    \ to [4] and section 8.2.5 of [5].\n   Newest Milliwatt Tone (mm):\n      1013.8\
    \ Hz - refer to [4].\n   Operation Complete (oc):\n      This is the standard\
    \ definition of operation complete [1].\n   Operation Failure (of):\n      This\
    \ is the standard definition of operation failure [1].\n   Old Milliwatt Tone\
    \ (om):\n      1000 Hz tone - refer to [4] and section 8.2.5 of [5].\n   Permanent\
    \ Signal Tone (pst):\n      In North America, this tone is applied to a busy line\n\
    \      verify/operator interrupt under specific circumstances as\n      described\
    \ in [17].\n   Quiet Termination (qt):\n      Quiet Termination is used in a 102\
    \ trunk test.  Reference section\n      6.20.5 [5] as well as [4].\n   Reorder\
    \ Tone(ro):\n      This maps to congestion tone in the ITU-T E.182 specification.\
    \  In\n      North America, reorder tone is a combination of two AC tones with\n\
    \      frequencies of 480 and 620 Hertz and levels of -24 dBm each, to\n     \
    \ give a combined level of -21 dBm.  The cadence for reorder tone is\n      0.25\
    \ seconds on, followed by 0.25 seconds off, repeating\n      continuously (until\
    \ time-out).  See GR-506-CORE [7], Section\n      17.2.7.\n   Special Information\
    \ Tone(sit(#)):\n      As described in ITU-T E.180 [8], the special information\
    \ tone\n      consists of a tone period in which 3 tones are produced followed\n\
    \      by a silent period of 1 second (total TO period of approximately 2\n  \
    \    seconds).  When used as a signal, it MUST be parameterized with a\n     \
    \ parameter value from 1 to 7, with the following meaning as defined\n      in\
    \ SR-2275, section 6.21.2 of [5].\n             -------------------------------------------\n\

    \      When requested as an event, the event MUST be parameterized with a\n  \
    \    decimal number from 1 to 7 to indicate which tone the gateway is\n      required\
    \ to detect.  The resulting notification also includes the\n      parameter. \
    \ Other countries may have one or more special\n      information tones with country\
    \ specific definitions (refer to\n      ITU-T E.180 supp. 2 [9]).  In this case,\
    \ special information tone\n      1 as defined in [9] is sit(1), special information\
    \ tone 2 is\n      sit(2) etc.\n      As an example, the Call Agent might make\
    \ a request such as:\n          RQNT 1234 ds/ds1-1/17@tgw2.example.net\n     \
    \     X: AB123FE0\n          R: t/sit(N)(2)\n      If the tone is detected, the\
    \ resulting notification might appear\n      as follows:\n          NTFY 3002\
    \ ds/ds1-3/6@gw-o.whatever.net MGCP 1.0\n          X: AB123FE0\n          O: t/sit(2)\n\
    \   Test Line (tl):\n      105 Test Line test progress tone (2225 Hz + or - 25\
    \ Hz at -10\n      dBm0).  Refer to section 8.2.5 of [5].\n   Test Pattern (tp(###)):\n\
    \      The tp(###) signal inserts the pattern ### continuously into the\n    \
    \  channel until the timeout period expires.  The parameter is\n      provided\
    \ as a decimal number from 0 to 255.  If the parameter is\n      omitted, the\
    \ default value is decimal 95.\n      In RequestedEvents, the parameter MAY be\
    \ supplied to indicate what\n      pattern the Call Agent wishes the gateway to\
    \ detect.  If the\n      parameter is omitted, the value 95 is assumed.  The pattern\
    \ MUST\n      be returned in the ObservedEvent (even if the parameter was not\n\
    \      requested).\n      A typical use for the test pattern signal is for the\
    \ test line 108\n      (digital loopback) test (refer to section 8.2.5 of [5]).\
    \  At the\n      termination side of a trunk, the Call Agent would request a\n\
    \      connection in \"loopback\" mode, which would do a digital loopback.\n \
    \     On the origination side of the trunk, the Call Agent would request\n   \
    \   that the test pattern be injected into the digital channel, and\n      would\
    \ check to see that the pattern was returned within the\n      timeout period.\
    \  As an example, the Call Agent would make the\n      following request on the\
    \ origination side:\n         RQNT 1234 ds/ds1-1/17@tgw2.example.net\n       \
    \  X: AB123FE0\n         S: t/tp\n         R: t/tp, t/oc, t/of\n      In this\
    \ case the Call Agent will either receive:\n         *  An ObservedEvent indicating\
    \ that the test has passed (i.e.,\n            \"O:t/op(95)\") or\n         *\
    \  An ObservedEvent indicating that the timeout occurred before\n            the\
    \ pattern was received (i.e., \"O:t/oc(t/tp)\"), indicating\n            that\
    \ the test failed.  Of course an operation failure would\n            indicate\
    \ failure as well.\n   No Circuit (zz):\n      This is an alias for Special Information\
    \ Tone 2, i.e., \"sit(2)\".\n"

    \   New events added to this package from the previously unversioned\n   package:\
    \ \"ht\", \"osi\", and \"lsa\".\n   Changes in event types: signals \"y\", \"\
    z\", changed from OO to TO and\n   BR respectively.  Ringing tones were extended\
    \ to allow for a ring\n   repetition signal parameter.\n   Note that default time-out\
    \ values may be over-ridden by the Call\n   Agent for any Time-Out signal defined\
    \ in this package by a \"to\"\n   signal parameter.  Refer to section 2 of this\
    \ document, as well as\n   [1] for details.\n   The description of events and\
    \ signals in the line package are as\n   follows:\n   ADSI Display (adsi):\n \
    \     This signal is included here to maintain compatibility with the\n      previous\
    \ version of this package.  The signal is not well-defined\n      and its use\
    \ is discouraged.\n   Answer Tone (aw):\n      This event is included here to\
    \ maintain compatibility with the\n      previous version of this package.  The\
    \ event is not well-defined\n      and its use is discouraged.\n   Busy Tone (bz):\n\
    \      Refer to ITU-T E.180 [8].  In North America, station Busy is a\n      combination\
    \ of two AC tones with frequencies of 480 and 620 Hertz\n      and levels of -24\
    \ dBm each, to give a combined level of -21 dBm.\n      The cadence for Station\
    \ Busy Tone is 0.5 seconds on followed by\n      0.5 seconds off, repeating. \
    \ See GR-506-CORE [7], Section 17.2.6.\n      It is considered an error to try\
    \ and play busy tone on a phone\n      that is on-hook and an error MUST consequently\
    \ be returned when\n      such attempts are made (error code 402 - phone on-hook).\n\
    \   Caller-id (ci(time, number, name)):\n      See GR-1188 [24], GR-30-CORE [14],\
    \ and GR-31 [25].  For backwards\n      compatibility, each of the three fields\
    \ are optional, but each of\n      the commas will always be included.  In accordance\
    \ with the\n      general MGCP grammar, it is RECOMMENDED to always include all\n\
    \      three fields - an empty quoted string can then be used in lieu of\n   \
    \   omitting a parameter:\n      The time parameter is coded as \"MM/DD/HH/MM\"\
    , where MM is a two-\n      digit decimal value for a Month between 01 and 12,\
    \ DD is a two-\n      digit value for a Day between 01 and 31, and Hour and Minute\
    \ are\n      two-digit values coded according to military local time, e.g., 00\n\
    \      is midnight, 01 is 1 a.m., and 13 is 1 p.m.  (Note: two digits\n      MUST\
    \ always be provided for each of the values of month, day,\n      hour, minutes\
    \ e.g., the month of January is indicated by the two\n      digits \"01\" rather\
    \ than just \"1\").\n      The number parameter is coded as an ASCII character\
    \ string of\n      decimal digits that identify the calling line number.  White\n\
    \      spaces are permitted if the string is quoted, but they will be\n      ignored.\
    \  If a quoted-string is provided, the string itself is\n      UTF-8 encoded (RFC\
    \ 2279) as usual for signal parameters.\n      The name parameter is coded as\
    \ a string of ASCII characters that\n      identify the calling line name.  White\
    \ spaces are permitted if the\n      string is quoted.  If a quoted-string is\
    \ provided, the string\n      itself is UTF-8 encoded (RFC 2279).\n      A \"\
    P\" in the number or name field is used to indicate a private\n      number or\
    \ name, and an \"O\" is used to indicate an unavailable\n      number or name.\
    \  Other letters MAY be used to provide additional\n      clarification as per\
    \ provider or vendor specifications.\n      The following example illustrates\
    \ the use of the caller-id signal:\n         S: l/ci(09/14/17/26, \"555 1212\"\
    , \"John Doe\")\n      An example indicating that the name and number are private:\n\
    \         S: l/ci(09/14/17/26,P,P)\n   Dial Tone (dl):\n      Refer to the ITU-T\
    \ E.180 [8] specification.  In North America,\n      dial tone is a combination\
    \ of two continuous AC tones with\n      frequencies of 350 and 440 Hertz and\
    \ levels of -13dBm each, to\n      give a combined level of -10 dBm.  See GR-506-CORE\
    \ [7] - LSSGR:\n      SIGNALING, Section 17.2.1.  It is considered an error to\
    \ try and\n      play dial-tone on a phone that is on-hook and an error MUST\n\
    \      consequently be returned when such attempts are made (error code\n    \
    \  402 - phone on-hook).\n   Error Tone (e):\n      This tone is maintained for\
    \ backwards compatibility.  The tone is\n      not well defined and its use is\
    \ discouraged.\n   Off-hook Transition (hd):\n      See GR-506-CORE [7], Section\
    \ 12.  It is considered an error to try\n      and request off-hook on a phone\
    \ that is off-hook and an error MUST\n      consequently be returned when such\
    \ attempts are made (error code\n      401 - phone off-hook).\n   Flash Hook (hf):\n\
    \      See GR-506-CORE [7], Section 12.  It is considered an error to try\n  \
    \    and request flash hook on a phone that is on-hook and an error\n      MUST\
    \ consequently be returned when such attempts are made (error\n      code 402\
    \ - phone on-hook).\n   Tone On Hold (ht):\n      A tone used to reassure a calling\
    \ subscriber who has been placed\n      on \"hold\".  Refer to ITU-T E.182 [10].\n\
    \   On-hook Transition (hu):\n      See GR-506-CORE [7], Section 12.  The timing\
    \ for the on-hook\n      signal is for flash response enabled, unless provisioned\n\
    \      otherwise.  It is considered an error to try and request flash\n      hook\
    \ on a phone that is on-hook and an error MUST consequently be\n      returned\
    \ when such attempts are made (error code 402 - phone on-\n      hook).\n   Line\
    \ Side Answer Supervision (lsa):\n      This provides Reverse Loop Current Feed\
    \ (RLCF) on the line (refer\n      to GR-506-CORE [7]) and is a way of indicating\
    \ that the called\n      party has answered for some line-side equipment.\n  \
    \ Message Waiting Indicator (mwi):\n      Message Waiting indicator tone uses\
    \ the same frequencies and\n      levels as dial tone (350 and 440 Hertz at -13dBm\
    \ each), but with a\n      cadence of 0.1 second on, 0.1 second off, repeated\
    \ 10 times,\n      followed by steady application of dial tone.  See GR-506-CORE\
    \ [7],\n      Section 17.2.3.  It is considered an error to try and play\n   \
    \   message-waiting indicator on a phone that is on-hook and an error\n      MUST\
    \ consequently be returned when such attempts are made (error\n      code 402\
    \ - phone on-hook).\n   Network Busy (nbz):\n      This is included here to maintain\
    \ compatibility with the previous\n      version of this package.  The \"nbz\"\
    \ signal is an alias for re-\n      order tone signal(\"ro\").  Future Call Agent\
    \ implementations that\n      require a network busy signal should use the \"\
    ro\" signal.  It is\n      also recommended that future Call Agents not request\
    \ to be\n      notified of the \"nbz\" event (a network busy event is generally\
    \ not\n      required in a line package; hence, \"ro\" is only a signal, not an\n\
    \      event).\n   Operation Complete (oc):\n      This is the standard definition\
    \ of operation complete [1].\n   Operation Failure (of):\n      This is the standard\
    \ definition of operation failure [1].\n   Network Disconnect (osi):\n      Network\
    \ Disconnect indicates that the far-end party has\n      disconnected.  The signal\
    \ that is sent on the line is provisioned\n      in the media gateway since it\
    \ may vary from country to country.\n      In North America, this signal is an\
    \ open switch interval which\n      results in a Loop Current Feed Open Signal\
    \ (LCFO) being applied to\n      the line (refer to GR-506-CORE [7], see also\
    \ See GR-505-CORE [6],\n      Section 4.5.2.1).  The default time-out value for\
    \ this signal is\n      900 ms.\n   Off-hook Warning Tone (ot):\n      Off-hook\
    \ warning tone, also known as receiver Off-Hook Tone (ROH\n      Tone).  This\
    \ is the irritating noise a telephone makes when it is\n      not hung up correctly.\
    \  In North America, ROH Tone is generated by\n      combining four tones at frequencies\
    \ of 1400 Hertz, 2060 Hertz,\n      2450 Hertz and 2600 Hertz, at a cadence of\
    \ 0.1 second on, 0.1\n      second off, then repeating.  GR-506-CORE [7], Section\
    \ 17.2.8\n      contains details about required power levels.  It is considered\
    \ an\n      error to try and play off-hook warning tone on a phone that is\n \
    \     on-hook, and an error MUST consequently be returned when such\n      attempts\
    \ are made (error code 402 - phone on-hook).\n   Prompt Tone (p):\n      The definition\
    \ of the prompt tone and its use may be found in\n      requirement GR-220 [20].\
    \  The tone in GR-220 (requirement \"R3-170\"\n      or GR-220) is a 300 ms burst\
    \ of a 400 Hz tone.\n   Ringing (rg):\n      See GR-506-CORE [7], Section 14.\
    \  The provisioning process may\n      define the ringing cadence.  The ringing\
    \ signal may be\n      parameterized with the signal parameter \"rep\" which specifies\
    \ the\n      maximum number of ringing cycles (repetitions) to apply.  The\n \
    \     value for \"rep\" is specified in decimal and can have any value\n     \
    \ from 1 to 255.  The following will apply the ringing signal for up\n      to\
    \ 6 ringing cycles:\n         S: l/rg(rep=6)\n      If the \"rep\" parameter is\
    \ specified, the signal times-out when the\n      number of repetitions are completed\
    \ (i.e., an operation complete\n      event can be requested and will occur at\
    \ the end of the\n      timeout/number of rings).\n      If the \"rep\" parameter\
    \ is supplied, then any timeout (\"to\") value\n      that is included will be\
    \ ignored, i.e.:\n         S: l/rg(rep=6,to=12000)\n      will be treated the\
    \ same as the previous example where the\n      parameter \"to=12000\" was not\
    \ included.  Of course, if the \"to\"\n      parameter is included without the\
    \ \"rep\", it will be acted upon\n      i.e.:\n         S: l/rg(to=12000)\n  \
    \    will ring for 12 seconds.\n      It is considered an error to try and ring\
    \ a phone that is off-hook\n      and an error MUST consequently be returned when\
    \ such attempts are\n      made (error code 401 - phone off-hook).\n   Distinctive\
    \ Ringing (r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6 or r7):\n      See GR-506-CORE [7], Section\
    \ 14.  Default values for r1 to r5 are\n      as defined for distinctive ringing\
    \ pattern 1 to 5 in GR-506-CORE\n      [7].  The default values for r0, r6 and\
    \ r7 are normal ringing\n      (i.e., the same cadence \"rg\").  The provisioning\
    \ process may\n      define the ringing cadence for each of these signals.  The\n\
    \      distinctive ringing signals may be parameterized with the signal\n    \
    \  parameter \"rep\" which specifies the maximum number of ringing\n      cycles\
    \ (repetitions) to apply.  The value for \"rep\" is specified\n      in decimal\
    \ and can have any value from 1 to 255.\n      The following will apply the ringing\
    \ signal for up to 6 ringing\n      cycles:\n         S: l/r1(rep=6)\n      If\
    \ the \"rep\" parameter is specified, the signal times-out when the\n      number\
    \ of repetitions are completed (i.e., an operation complete\n      event can be\
    \ requested and will occur at the end of the\n      timeout/number of rings)\n\
    \      If the \"rep\" parameter is supplied, then any timeout (\"to\") value\n\
    \      that is included will be ignored, i.e.:\n         S: l/r1(rep=6,to=12000)\n\
    \      will be treated the same as the previous example where the\n      parameter\
    \ \"to=12000\" was not included.  Of course, if the \"to\"\n      parameter is\
    \ included without the \"rep\", it will be acted upon\n      i.e.:\n         S:\
    \ l/r1(to=12000)\n      will ring for 12 seconds.\n      It is considered an error\
    \ to try and ring a phone that is off-hook\n      and an error MUST consequently\
    \ be returned when such attempts are\n      made (error code 401 - phone off-hook).\n\
    \   Reorder Tone (ro):\n      This maps to congestion tone in the ITU-T E.182\
    \ [10]\n      specification.  In North America, reorder tone is a combination\
    \ of\n      two AC tones with frequencies of 480 and 620 Hertz, and levels of\n\
    \      -24 dBm each, to give a combined level of -21 dBm.  The cadence\n     \
    \ for reorder tone is 0.25 seconds on, followed by 0.25 seconds off,\n      repeating\
    \ continuously.\n   Ringsplash (rs):\n      Also known as \"Reminder ring\", this\
    \ tone is a burst of ringing\n      that may be applied to the physical forwarding\
    \ line (when idle) to\n      indicate that a call has been forwarded and to remind\
    \ the user\n      that a Call Forward sub-feature is active.  In the US, it is\n\
    \      defined to be a 0.5(-0,+0.1) second burst of power ringing (see\n     \
    \ [11]).\n   Distinctive Tone Pattern (s(###)):\n      This is used to signal\
    \ or detect a tone pattern defined by the\n      parameter where the parameter\
    \ may have a value from 0 to 999.\n      When specified as an event, the parameter\
    \ MUST be included.  The\n      parameter will also be included when the event\
    \ is reported.  This\n      event (the definition of tones associated with each\
    \ parameter\n      value) requires special provisioning in the Call Agent and\
    \ gateway\n      to insure interoperability.  This signal is included here to\n\
    \      maintain compatibility with the previous version of this package.\n   Special\
    \ Information Tone(sit(#)):\n      As described in ITU-T E.180 [8], the special\
    \ information tone\n      consists of a tone period in which 3 tones are produced,\
    \ followed\n      by a silent period of 1 second (total TO period of approximately\
    \ 2\n      seconds).  It MAY be parameterized with a parameter value from 1\n\
    \      to 7, with the following meaning as defined in SR-2275, section\n     \
    \ 6.21.2 [5]:\n             -------------------------------------------\n    \
    \        | sit(1) | RO' | reorder SIT, intra-LATA    |\n            | sit(2) |\
    \ RO\" | reorder SIT, inter-LATA    |\n            | sit(3) | NC' | no circuit\
    \ SIT, intra-LATA |\n            | sit(4) | NC\" | no circuit SIT, inter-LATA\
    \ |\n            | sit(5) | IC  | intercept SIT              |\n            |\
    \ sit(6) | VC  | vacant code SIT            |\n            | sit(7) | IO  | ineffective\
    \ other SIT      |\n             -------------------------------------------\n\
    \      If the parameter is left out, the NC' SIT tone that corresponds to\n  \
    \    the signal \"L/sit(3)\" is assumed.\n      Other countries may have one or\
    \ more special information tones\n      with country specific definitions (refer\
    \ to ITU-T E.180 supp. 2\n      [9]).  In this case, special information tone\
    \ 1 as defined in [9]\n      is sit(1), special information tone 2 is sit(2) etc.\n\
    \   Stutter Dial Tone (sl):\n      Stutter Dial Tone (also called Recall Dial\
    \ Tone in GR-506-CORE [7]\n      and \"special dial tone\" in ITU-T E.182 [10])\
    \ is used to confirm\n      some action and request additional input from the\
    \ user.  An\n      example application is to cancel call-waiting, prior to entering\
    \ a\n      destination address.\n      The stutter dial tone signal may be parameterized\
    \ with the signal\n      parameter \"del\", which will specify a delay in milliseconds\
    \ to\n      apply between the confirmation tone and the dial tone.  The\n    \
    \  parameter can have any value from 0 to 10000 ms, rounded to the\n      nearest\
    \ non-zero value divisible by 100 (i.e., tenth of a second).\n      The following\
    \ will apply stutter dial tone with a delay of 1.5\n      seconds between the\
    \ confirmation tone and the dial tone:\n         S: l/sl(del=1500)\n      It is\
    \ considered an error to try and play stutter dial tone on a\n      phone that\
    \ is on-hook and an error MUST consequently be returned\n      when such attempts\
    \ are made (error code 402 - phone on-hook).\n   Alerting Tone (v):\n      A 440\
    \ Hz Tone of a 2 second duration, followed by a 1/2 second of\n      tone every\
    \ 10 seconds.  This event is included for backwards\n      compatibility with\
    \ the previous version of the package.\n   Visual Message Waiting Indicator (vmwi):\n\
    \      The transmission of the VMWI messages will conform to the\n      requirements\
    \ in [13] and the CPE guidelines in [12].  Refer also\n      to section 6.6 of\
    \ GR-30-CORE [14].  VMWI messages will only be\n      sent from the gateway to\
    \ the attached equipment when the line is\n      idle.  If new messages arrive\
    \ while the line is busy, the VMWI\n      indicator message will be delayed until\
    \ the line goes back to the\n      idle state.  After the gateway restarts, the\
    \ state of the signal\n      will be \"off\", and hence the Call Agent MUST refresh\
    \ the CPE's\n      visual indicator if it is supposed to be \"on\".\n   Alternative\
    \ Call Waiting Tones (wt, wt1, .., wt4):\n      Refer to ITU-T E.180 [8].  For\
    \ North American tone definitions,\n      refer to GR-506-CORE [7], Section 14.2.\
    \  \"wt\" and \"wt1\" are both\n      aliases for the default Call Waiting tone,\
    \ which in North America,\n      is a 440-Hz tone applied for 300 plus or minus\
    \ 50 ms.  The tone is\n      then repeated once after 10 seconds.\n      These\
    \ signals are timeout signals with a default timeout value of\n      12 seconds,\
    \ which allows the tone to be played twice with a single\n      request (refer\
    \ to GR-571-CORE [16]).  However, there are cases\n      (Requirement R3-73 of\
    \ GR-575-CORE [18]), in which only a single\n      tone is required.  In that\
    \ case, the Call Agent may make the\n      request with a shorter timeout period\
    \ to eliminate the second tone\n      (e.g., \"S: wt(to=2000)\" - which stops\
    \ the signal after 2 seconds\n      so that the second tone will not occur).\n\
    \      Signals wt2, wt3 and wt4 are alternates that are used for\n      distinctive\
    \ call-waiting tone patterns (refer to GR-506-CORE,\n      Section 14.2 [7]. \
    \ It is considered an error to try and apply\n      call-waiting tone on a phone\
    \ that is on-hook and an error MUST\n      consequently be returned when such\
    \ attempts are made (error code\n      402 - phone on-hook).\n   Recorder Warning\
    \ Tone(y):\n      Refer to ITU-T E.180 [8] - also Bellcore document SR-2275 [5]\n\
    \      section 6.20.  When recording equipment is used, this tone is\n      connected\
    \ to the line to inform the distant party that the\n      conversation is being\
    \ recorded  - typical value used is a 1400 Hz\n      Tone of a 0.5 second duration\
    \ every 15 seconds.\n   Calling Card Service Tone(z):\n      This tone is used\
    \ to inform the customer that credit card\n      information must be keyed in.\
    \  Typically, it consists of 60 ms of\n      941 + 1477 Hz (the DTMF #digit) and\
    \ 940 ms of 350 + 440 Hz (dial\n      tone), decaying exponentially with a time\
    \ constant of 200 ms.\n      Refer to Bellcore document SR-2275 [5], section 6.20.\n"

    \ an Extension Digit Map Letter that is used to\n   override the shortest possible\
    \ match behavior for a given entry in a\n   digit map (see [1]).  The letter \"\
    P\" (for partial match override), at\n   the end of a digit map entry, instructs\
    \ the gateway to only consider\n   that entry a match if the current dial string\
    \ does not partially\n   match another entry.  For example, given the digit map\n\
    \      ([3-7]11|123xxxxxxx|[1-7]xxxxxxP|8xxxP)\n   and a current dial string of\
    \ \"1234567\", we would not consider this a\n   match (as the rules in [1] would\
    \ otherwise imply); however a current\n   dial string of \"411\" would be considered\
    \ a match as usual.  A current\n   dial string of \"8234\" would be considered\
    \ a match since there is no\n   other partial match.\n   Note that the digit map\
    \ letter \"P\" is not an event, but simply a\n   syntactic and semantic digit\
    \ map extension.  Thus, the \"P\" is not\n   included in the list of requested\
    \ or observed events.\n   Support for this package is strongly RECOMMENDED.\n"

    \ contains a comma-separated list of signals to be played\n      out.  Each of\

    \ the signal list is still treated as a\n      single parameterized signal of\
    \ type Time-Out though.  The signals\n      in the list are played to completion\
    \ one after the other in the\n      left to right order specified.  The package\
    \ for each signal in the\n      list must be specified.  For example, to play\
    \ out the DTMF digits\n      123456:\n         S: sl/s(d/1,d/2,d/3,d/4,d/5,d/6)\n\
    \      This will result in the DTMF digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 being\n      played\
    \ out in order.\n      It is illegal to include an OO signal as one of the signals\
    \ in the\n      list or to request recursive definitions (signal lists within\n\
    \      signal lists).  If this or any other unsupported signal is\n      included,\
    \ error code 538 (event/signal parameter error) MUST be\n      returned by the\
    \ gateway.\n      Note that as the gateway plays the ordered list of signals,\
    \ if it\n      encounters a TO signal with an infinite timeout, it will continue\n\
    \      to play that signal until the Signal List signal is stopped (i.e.,\n  \
    \    other signals later in the list will never be played).\n      If the operation\
    \ complete (\"oc\") event is requested, it will be\n      detected once, when\
    \ the last signal in the list has been played\n      out (regardless of whether\
    \ there are any TO signals in the list).\n      The operation complete event will\
    \ only report the signal list name\n      itself, i.e., without the parameters\
    \ supplied as in:\n         O:   sl/oc(sl/s)\n      Should any of the signals\
    \ in the signal list result in an error,\n      an operation failure event for\
    \ the Signal List signal MUST be\n      generated.  Only the signal list name\
    \ will be included, thus it is\n      not possible to determine which of the signals\
    \ in the signal list\n      actually failed.\n      Note that if an event occurs\
    \ while the \"SL/S\" signal is playing,\n      the \"SL/S\" signal is stopped\
    \ in the following manner:\n         *  If the signal in the list that was playing\
    \ at the time the\n            event occurred is of type BR, then the BR signal\
    \ will be\n            played to completion and no other signals in the list will\n\
    \            be played.\n         *  If the signal in the list that was playing\
    \ at the time the\n            event occurred is of type TO, then the TO signal\

    \ This package provides support for the media format parameter Local\n   Connection\
    \ Option (LCO).  The media format parameter LCO is similar\n   to the \"fmtp\"\
    \ attribute in SDP [15] and is applicable to all of the\n   same media formats\
    \ that the corresponding SDP fmtp attribute could be\n   used with (i.e., media\
    \ format parameters for any media format MIME\n   type).  The media format parameter\
    \ is encoded as the keyword \"fmtp\"\n   or \"o-fmtp\", followed by a colon and\
    \ a quoted string beginning with\n   the media format name (MIME subtype only)\
    \ followed by a space,\n   followed by the media format parameters associated\
    \ with that media\n   format.  For simplicity, we will use the terms \"codec\"\
    \ and \"media\n   format\" interchangeably in the following.  Multiple formats\
    \ may be\n   indicated by either repeating the \"fmtp\" local connection option\n\
    \   multiple times, such as:\n      L:a:codec1;codec2, fmtp:\"codec1 formatX\"\
    , fmtp:\"codec2 formatY\"\n   or alternatively by having a single \"fmtp\" keyword\
    \ followed by a\n   colon, and a semi-colon separated list of quoted strings for\
    \ each\n   media format parameter, as in:\n      L:a:codec1;codec2, fmtp:\"codec1\
    \ formatX\";\"codec2 formatY\"\n   The two formats may be mixed.\n   If it is\
    \ possible for the same codec to be requested with and without\n   the special\
    \ \"fmtp\" format, the following could result:\n      L:a:codec1;codec1, fmtp:\"\
    codec1 formatX\"\n   However, it would not be clear if the fmtp parameter was\
    \ to be\n   applied to the first or the second occurrence of the codec.  The\n\
    \   problem with that is, that codec ordering is important (i.e., codecs\n   are\
    \ listed in preferred order), and the above syntax does not provide\n   a way\
    \ to indicate if \"formatX\" is preferred (i.e., associated with\n   the first\
    \ \"codec1\") or not (i.e., associated with the second\n   \"codec1\").  In order\
    \ to resolve this dilemma, when the same codec is\n   requested with multiple\
    \ formats, the codec name in the \"fmtp\" format\n   string is followed by a colon\
    \ and an <order>, where <order> is a\n   number from one to N for N occurrences\
    \ of the same codec in the codec\n   list i.e.:\n      L:a:codec1;codec1, fmtp:\"\
    codec1:2 formatX\"\n   indicates that \"formatX\" is associated with the second\
    \ instance of\n   \"codec1\" in the \"a:codec1;codec1\" list.  If an invalid instance\n\
    \   number is supplied (e.g., instance 3 where there are only two\n   instances),\
    \ then error code 524 - inconsistency in local connection\n   options will be\
    \ returned.\n   Pre-pending \"fmtp\" with the string \"o-\" (i.e., \"o-fmtp\"\
    ) indicates\n   that the format is optional.  In that case, the gateway may decide\n\
    \   not to use the fmtp parameter specified, or only use it in part.\n   If the\
    \ \"fmtp\" in an LCO is not optional (i.e., does not have \"o-\" in\n   front\
    \ of it), and the LCO value is either not recognized or not\n   supported, then\
    \ the associated codec is considered \"not supported\".\n   When auditing capabilities,\
    \ the \"fmtp\" local connection option MUST\n   be returned with a semi-colon\
    \ separated list of supported formats\n   and/or multiple independent \"fmtp\"\
    \ parameters as in:\n      A: a:telephone-event, fmtp:\"telephone-event 0-15,32-35\"\
    ,...\n      A: a:PCMU;G729, fmtp:\"PCMU foo\";\"PCMU bar\", fmtp:\"G729 foobar\"\
    ,...\n   One example uses the media format parameter LCO in conjunction with\n\
    \   the media format \"telephone-event\", as defined in RFC 2833 [33].  If\n \
    \  the media format \"telephone-event\" is used without the \"fmtp\" media\n \
    \  format parameter, the DTMF digits (telephone events 0-15 from RFC\n   2833\
    \ [33]) are assumed - such practice is however discouraged.  On\n   the other\
    \ hand, the media format parameter LCO MAY be used to specify\n   the exact set\
    \ of events that are being requested via RFC 2833 [33].\n   Example:\n      L:\
    \ a:PCMU;telephone-event,fmtp:\"telephone-event 16\"\n   indicates that if telephone\
    \ events are supported at all, then this\n   request is specifically for event\
    \ 16.\n   In another case, the Call Agent may indicate that some format\n   parameters\
    \ are \"required\", while others are optional.  In the example\n   below, telephone\
    \ events 0-15 are a \"must\", while telephone events 16,\n   70 and 71 are optional.\n\
    \      L: a:PCMU;telephone-event, o-fmtp:\"telephone-event 16,70,71\",\n     \
    \ fmtp:\"telephone-event 0-15\"\n   If the gateway cannot support telephone events\
    \ 0-15, it MUST NOT\n   include the \"telephone-event\" media format in the SDP\
    \ in its\n   response.  On the other hand, if it can support those telephone\n\
    \   events, it SHOULD indicate support for those events, as well as any\n   of\
    \ the events 16, 70 and 71 that it supports.\n   If a request is made to audit\
    \ the capabilities of an endpoint, and\n   the endpoint supports the \"telephone\
    \ event\" media format with events\n   \"0-16\", then the audit would include\
    \ the following:\n      A: a:telephone-event, fmtp: \"telephone-event 0-16\"\n\
    \   Another example is the use of redundancy with RFC 2198 [32].  Again,\n   the\
    \ format of the fmtp string is similar to that used in the SDP\n   except that\
    \ the literal string (\"red\" in this case) is used rather\n   than the payload\
    \ type:\n      L: a:G729;pcmu;red,fmtp:\"red pcmu/g729\"\n   The corresponding\
    \ media description in the SDP as part of the\n   connection request acknowledgment\
    \ might look like:\n      m=audio 12345 RTP/AVP 98 18 0\n      a=rtpmap:98 red/8000/1\n\
    \      a=fmtp:98 0/18\n   If we combine both telephone events and redundancy,\
    \ an example local\n   connection option might look as follows (carriage return\
    \ added for\n   formatting reasons here):\n      L: a:G729;pcmu;red;telephone-event,fmtp:\"\
    red pcmu/g729\",\n                                         fmtp: \"telephone-event\
    \ 16\"\n   Note that we again specify the literal string for the encoding method\n\
    \   rather than its payload type.  This is a general principle that\n   should\
    \ be used with this LocalConnectionOption.\n   The corresponding SDP might appear\
    \ as follows:\n      m=audio 12345 RTP/AVP 97 98 18 0\n      a=rtpmap:97 red/8000/1\n\
    \      a=fmtp:97 0/18\n      a=rtpmap:98 telephone event\n      a=fmtp:98 16\n\
    \   Note that the fmtp LCO may be used in any situation where the\n   corresponding\
    \ SDP attribute may be used.  An example of a local\n   connection option that\
    \ involves a media type other than audio and a\n   \"foobar\" fmtp parameter:\n\
    \      L: a:image/tiff, fmtp:\"tiff foobar\"\n   Note that normally local connection\
    \ options that are associated with\n   a package should have the package prefix\
    \ included as per the package\n   extension rules in [1].  The \"fmtp\" and \"\
    o-fmtp\" LCO in the \"FM\"\n   package are an exception.  The package prefix is\
    \ not included in the\n   case of the \"fmtp\" and \"o-fmtp\" local connection\
    \ options because they\n   were created before the extension rules in [1] were\
    \ defined.\n   These two LocalConnectionOptions have been registered with IANA.\n"

    \   Changes in event types: \"co1\" and \"co2\" signals changed from OO to\n \
    \  TO.\n   New events added to this package from the previously unversioned\n\
    \   package: \"iu\", \"rto\", \"ma\".\n   Note that default time-out values may\
    \ be over-ridden by the Call\n   Agent for any Time-Out signal defined in this\
    \ package by a \"to\"\n   signal parameter.  Refer to section 2 of this document,\
    \ as well as\n   [1] for details.\n   The events in this package all refer to\
    \ media streams (connections),\n   i.e., they cannot be detected on an endpoint.\
    \  Furthermore, with the\n   exception of the \"iu\" event, which is defined for\
    \ any type of media,\n   all other events in this package are defined for RTP\
    \ media streams\n   only (i.e., if they are used on connections that do not use\
    \ RTP, the\n   behavior is not defined).\n   Signals requested (e.g., \"co1\"\
    \ and \"co2\") must indicate the\n   connection ID (e.g., \"S: r/co1@connectionID\"\
    ).  An event may be\n   requested for all existing connections using the \"*\"\
    \ wildcard for the\n   connectionID as described in [1].\n   Example:\n      R:\
    \ r/uc@*    (request to detect uc on all connections) or\n      R: r/uc@connectionID\
    \   (request to detect uc only on a specific\n      connection)\n   An event detected\
    \ on a connection will include the connectionID,\n   e.g.:\n      O: r/uc@connectionID(15)\n\
    \   Continuity tones (co1 and co2):\n      These are the same as the events defined\
    \ in the Trunk package,\n      except in this case, they are only played over\
    \ a network\n      connection and the connectionID MUST be supplied (e.g., \"\
    s:\n      r/co1@connectionID\").  They can be used in conjunction with the\n \
    \     Network LoopBack (netwloop) or Network Continuity Test (netwtest)\n    \
    \  modes to test the continuity of an RTP circuit.  However, in the\n      case\
    \ of testing IP continuity, a one-tone test is sufficient i.e.,\n      generating\
    \ and detecting \"co1\" at one end, with connection mode in\n      network loopback\
    \ mode at the other end.  Note that the test can\n      also be done using telephone\
    \ events rather than tones, i.e., event\n      167 in RFC 2833 [33] corresponds\
    \ to \"co1\".  In this case,\n      connection requests are made with local connection\
    \ options such\n      as:\n         L: a:PCMU;telephone-event,fmtp:\"telephone-event\
    \ 167\"\n      in order to request support for telephone event 167.  If both ends\n\
    \      support the event, then the network loopback proceeds as usual,\n     \
    \ except that telephone events corresponding to the co1 tone are\n      sent,\
    \ as opposed to the co1 tone itself.\n   ICMP Unreachable Received (iu):\n   \
    \   This event indicates that some number of ICMP unreachable packets\n      [19]\
    \ was received for this connection since an RQNT was received\n      requesting\
    \ this event.  This notification indicates that packets\n      that were sent\
    \ by the gateway on this connection either did not\n      arrive at their destination\
    \ or were not accepted (e.g., the port\n      was closed).  When this event is\
    \ requested, a single parameter\n      with a decimal number from 1 to 255 may\
    \ be included to indicate\n      the number of ICMP un-reachable packets that\
    \ must occur before the\n      event is notified.  If no parameter is supplied,\
    \ with the request\n      then a default value of 3 is assumed.  This is a one-shot\
    \ event in\n      that once the event occurs, a further request is required in\
    \ order\n      to re-initiate counting.\n      The observed event is parameterized\
    \ with two parameters:\n         *  The first parameter is the number of ICMP\
    \ unreachable\n            packets received (i.e., the same value that was included\
    \ in\n            the request - or the value 3, if the requested event was not\n\
    \            parameterized)\n         *  The second parameter is the error code\
    \ indicated in the ICMP\n            unreachable packet, e.g.:\n             \
    \  0 = net unreachable;\n               1 = host unreachable;\n              \
    \ 2 = protocol unreachable;\n               3 = port unreachable;\n          \
    \     4 = fragmentation needed and DF set;\n               5 = source route failed.\n\
    \               etc.\n      An example of a request might be as follows:\n   \
    \      RQNT 2001 ds/ds1-3/6@gw-o.whatever.net MGCP 1.0\n         X: 0123456789B0\n\
    \         R: r/iu@364823(N)(5)\n      In this case, a notify will occur if 5 ICMP\
    \ port unreachable\n      packets are received as a result of RTP and/or RTCP\
    \ packets being\n      sent from this gateway on the connection with connection\
    \ ID\n      364823.\n      The resulting NTFY with observed events might be as\
    \ follows:\n         NTFY 3002 ds/ds1-3/6@gw-o.whatever.net MGCP 1.0\n       \
    \  X: 0123456789B0\n         O: r/iu@364823(5,3)\n      The first parameter indicates\
    \ 5 ICMP unreachable packets were\n      received since the RQNT with this request\
    \ was sent.  The second\n      parameter (\"3\") specifies the reason, which in\
    \ this case, is \"port\n      unreachable\".\n   Jitter Buffer Size Changed (ji):\n\
    \      This event is only included here to maintain compatibility with\n     \
    \ the previous version of this package.  This event is used to\n      indicate\
    \ that the gateway has made an adjustment to the depth of\n      the jitter buffer.\
    \  The syntax for requesting notification is\n      \"ji\", which tells the media\
    \ gateway that the controller wants\n      notification of any jitter buffer size\
    \ changes.  The syntax for\n      notification from the media gateway to the controller\
    \ is\n      \"JI(####)\", where the #### is a decimal number from 1 to 65536,\n\
    \      indicating the new size of the jitter buffer in milliseconds.\n   Media\
    \ Start (ma):\n      The media start event occurs on a connection when the first\
    \ valid\n      RTP media packet is received on the connection.  This event can\
    \ be\n      used to synchronize a local signal, e.g., ringback, with the\n   \
    \   arrival of media from the other party.\n      The event is detected on a connection.\
    \  If no connection is\n      specified, the event applies to all connections\
    \ for the endpoint,\n      regardless of when the connections are created (i.e.,\
    \ if a\n      connection is not specified, the event will occur when the first\n\
    \      valid RTP packet arrives on any one of the connections on that\n      endpoint).\n\
    \   Operation complete (oc):\n      This is the standard definition of operation\
    \ complete [1].\n   Operation failure (of):\n      This is the standard definition\
    \ of operation failure [1].\n   Packet Loss Exceeded (pl):\n      Packet loss\
    \ rate exceeds the threshold of the specified decimal\n      number (with a range\
    \ of 1 to 100,000) of packets per 100,000\n      packets, where the packet loss\
    \ number is indicated in parenthesis.\n      For example, PL(10) is a drop rate\
    \ of 10 in 100,000 packets.  This\n      event is requested with a parameter indicating\
    \ at what packet loss\n      rate the Call Agent wishes to be reported.  If the\
    \ packet loss\n      exceeds that value, the event is reported with that same\n\
    \      parameter.  The event is only reported once when the packet loss\n    \
    \  threshold is exceeded.  Once reported, a following request will\n      re-initiate\
    \ packet loss measurements and report when the threshold\n      is exceeded again.\n\
    \   Quality alert (qa):\n      The packet loss rate or the combination of delay\
    \ and jitter\n      exceeding a quality threshold.  The quality thresholds for\
    \ delay,\n      jitter and packet loss rate are provisioned values.\n   RTP/RTCP\
    \ Timeout (rto(<timeout>,st=<start-time>)):\n      This event indicates that neither\
    \ RTP nor RTCP packets have been\n      received on this connection for a period\
    \ of time equal to the\n      <timeout> value (in seconds).  The timeout value\
    \ can be supplied\n      as a decimal number from 1 to 65535 in the parameter\
    \ when the\n      request is made.  The <timeout> parameter will be supplied in\n\
    \      ObservedEvents when the event is reported - it then simply repeats\n  \
    \    the value used.  If an RTP or RTCP packet is received before the\n      timer\
    \ expires, then the timer is reset and re-started.  The event\n      will only\
    \ be generated if the timer expires without an RTP or RTCP\n      packet arriving\
    \ on the specified connection during the specified\n      period of time.  Note\
    \ that if the event is requested without the\n      <timeout> parameter, then\
    \ a default timeout of 60 seconds is\n      assumed.  The <timeout> value will\
    \ still be reported in\n      ObservedEvents, even if no timeout value was indicated\
    \ in the\n      request (the default value will be indicated in that case).  This\n\
    \      is a one-shot event in that once the event occurs, a further\n      request\
    \ is required in order to re-initialize the timer.\n      Another optional <start-time>\
    \ parameter may also be included.\n      This is used to indicate when the timer\
    \ starts.  It can have one\n      of the following values:\n         *  \"im\"\
    \ for immediate i.e., the timer starts as soon as the\n            request is\
    \ received.  This is the default.\n         *  \"ra\" to indicate that the timer\
    \ should start only after an\n            RTCP packet has been received from the\
    \ other end (i.e., the\n            timer will be initiated when the first RTCP\
    \ packet is\n            received after the request is made).  Note that in the\
    \ case\n            where the other end does not support RTCP, the timer will\n\
    \            never be initiated.\n      Note that either the <timeout> or <start-time>\
    \ may be included in\n      the request, but only the <timeout> value is included\
    \ in the\n      report.\n      An example of a request might be as follows:\n\
    \         RQNT 2001 ds/ds1-3/6@gw-o.whatever.net MGCP 1.0\n         X: 0123456789B0\n\
    \         R: r/rto@364823(N)(120,st=im)\n      In this case, a notify will occur\
    \ if there is a period of time\n      when no RTP or RTCP packets have been received\
    \ on connection\n      364823 for 120 seconds.\n      The resulting NTFY with\
    \ observed events would be as follows:\n         NTFY 3002 ds/ds1-3/6@gw-o.whatever.net\
    \ MGCP 1.0\n         X: 0123456789B0\n         O: r/rto@364823(120)\n   Sampling\
    \ Rate Changed (sr):\n      This event is only included here to maintain compatibility\
    \ with\n      the previous version of this package.  This event indicates that\n\
    \      the packetization period changed to some decimal number in\n      milliseconds\
    \ enclosed in parenthesis, as in SR(20).\n   Used Codec Changed (uc):\n      This\
    \ event is only included here to maintain compatibility with\n      the previous\

  contents:
  - "2.11.1.  Description\n   The \"RES\" package provides local connection option\
    \ support for\n   resource reservations as well as an event to indicate reservation\n\
    \   loss.\n   A number of LocalConnectionOption parameters are used in doing\n\
    \   resource reservations: \"reservation request\", \"reservation\n   direction\"\
    , \"reservation confirmation\" and \"resource sharing\".\n   Reservation Request\
    \ LocalConnectionOption: The gateways can be\n   instructed to perform a reservation\
    \ on a given connection using RSVP.\n   When a reservation is needed, the Call\
    \ Agent will specify the\n   reservation profile that should be used, which is\
    \ either \"controlled\n   load\" or \"guaranteed service\".  The absence of reservation\
    \ can be\n   indicated by asking for the \"best effort\" service, which is the\n\
    \   default value for this parameter.\n   Whether or not RSVP will be done is\
    \ dependent on whether the\n   reservation request LocalConnectionOption parameter\
    \ has been included\n   in a connection request for this connection (with either\
    \ \"controlled\n   load\" or \"guaranteed service\" indicated).  If a modify connection\n\
    \   (MDCX) request requires a change in the reservation and the\n   \"reservation\
    \ request\" parameter is not included in the\n   LocalConnectionOptions, but was\
    \ included in the\n   LocalConnectionOptions for a previous connection request\
    \ for that\n   connection, then the \"reservation request\" value defaults to\
    \ its\n   previously saved value for that connection.  If a modify connection\n\
    \   (MDCX) request explicitly contains a \"reservation request\",\n   indicating\
    \ a request for \"best effort\" for a connection that has an\n   existing reservation,\
    \ the existing reservation will be torn down.\n   Reservation Direction LocalConnectionOption:\n\
    \      When reservation has been requested on a connection, the gateway\n    \
    \  will examine the reservation direction LocalConnectionOption\n      parameter\
    \ to determine the direction that the reservations require\n      and do the following:\n\
    \         *  Start emitting RSVP \"PATH\" messages if the reservation\n      \
    \      direction LocalConnectionOptions parameter specified \"send-\n        \
    \    only\" or \"send-receive\".\n         *  Start emitting RSVP \"RESV\" messages\
    \ as soon as it receives\n            \"PATH\" messages if the reservation direction\
    \ parameter\n            specified \"receive-only\" or \"send-receive\".\n   \
    \   If an RSVP reservation is requested, but the reservation direction\n     \
    \ LocalConnectionOption parameter is missing, the reservation\n      direction\
    \ defaults to the previously saved value of the\n      reservation direction parameter\
    \ for that connection.  If there was\n      no previous reservation direction\
    \ parameter for that connection,\n      the value is deduced from the connection\
    \ mode.  That is:\n         *  Start emitting RSVP \"PATH\" messages if the connection\
    \ is in\n            \"send-only\", \"send-receive\", \"conference\", \"network\
    \ loop\n            back\" or \"network continuity test\" mode (if a remote\n\
    \            connection descriptor has been received).\n         *  Start emitting\
    \ RSVP \"RESV\" messages as soon as it receives\n            \"PATH\" messages\
    \ if the connection is in \"receive-only\",\n            \"send-receive\", \"\
    conference\", \"network loop back\" or\n            \"network continuity test\"\
    \ mode.\n   Reservation Confirmation LocalConnectionOption:\n      Another LocalConnectionOption\
    \ parameter for RSVP reservations is\n      the reservation confirmation parameter,\
    \ which determines what the\n      resource reservation pre-condition (see [1])\
    \ is for acknowledging\n      a successful connection request:\n         *  If\
    \ the reservation confirmation parameter is set to \"none\",\n            the\
    \ gateway will \"Ack\" the connection request without\n            waiting for\
    \ reservation completion.  This is the default\n            behavior.\n      \
    \   *  If the \"reservation confirmation\" parameter is set to\n            \"\
    send-only\", the gateway will \"Ack\" when the PATH message\n            has been\
    \ sent and the corresponding RESV is received to\n            indicate successful\
    \ reservation in the send direction.\n         *  If the \"reservation confirmation\"\
    \ parameter is set to\n            \"receive-only\", the gateway will \"Ack\"\
    \ when reservation\n            confirm for a reservation has been received.\n\
    \         *  If the reservation confirmation parameter is set to \"send-\n   \
    \         receive\", the gateway will \"Ack\" only after the PATH message\n  \
    \          has been sent and the corresponding RESV has been received\n      \
    \      for send direction, and reservation confirm has been\n            received\
    \ for the receive direction.\n   Note that:\n      Values \"receive-only\" and\
    \ \"send-receive\" are triggers for the\n      gateway to request reservation\
    \ confirm (RESVCONF) when it sends\n      out the RESV.\n      Pre-conditions\
    \ SHOULD only be added for the direction(s) for which\n      resource reservations\
    \ have been requested.  If a direction is\n      added as a pre-condition, and\
    \ that direction was not requested in\n      the resource reservation, the direction\
    \ MUST simply be ignored as\n      a pre-condition.\n      In this approach, resource\
    \ reservation success is the pre-\n      condition to final acknowledgement of\
    \ the connection request.  If\n      the reservation fails, the connection request\
    \ also fails (error\n      code 404 - insufficient bandwidth) - as will any other\
    \ part of the\n      transaction, e.g., a notification request included as part\
    \ of the\n      connection request.  A typical example of this would be a request\n\
    \      to ring the phone and look for off-hook, included with the\n      connection\
    \ request.  If the reservation fails, the phone will not\n      ring.  Similarly,\
    \ if the phone is already off-hook, the command\n      fails and there will be\
    \ no resource reservation.\n      A provisional response SHOULD be provided if\
    \ confirmation is\n      expected to occur outside the normal retry timers and\
    \ in fact a\n      provisional response MUST be provided if the reservation\n\
    \      confirmation parameter has value \"send-receive\" (without a\n      provisional\
    \ response, SDP information cannot be returned until the\n      final \"Ack\"\
    \ which will not occur until the reservation is\n      complete.  This can result\
    \ in a deadlock since the SDP information\n      typically needs to be passed\
    \ to the other end in order for it to\n      initiate the RSVP PATH message in\
    \ the other direction).  The SDP\n      information and connectionID MUST be included\
    \ in both the\n      provisional response and the final response.  Note that in\
    \ order\n      to ensure rapid detection of a lost final response, final\n   \
    \   responses issued after provisional responses for a transaction\n      SHALL\
    \ be acknowledged, i.e., they SHALL include an empty\n      \"ResponseAck\" parameter\
    \ in the final response (see [1]).\n      If the transaction time is outside the\
    \ expected bounds (time\n      T-HIST - see the section on provisional responses\
    \ in [1]), error\n      code 406 (transaction timeout) SHOULD be returned.\n \
    \     Also note that if the reservation confirmation parameter is\n      omitted,\
    \ the value of the reservation confirmation parameter\n      defaults to its previously\
    \ saved value.  If there is no previously\n      saved value for the reservation\
    \ confirmation parameter, or the\n      reservation confirmation parameter has\
    \ the value \"none\", then\n      successful resource reservation is not a pre-condition\
    \ to\n      providing an acknowledgement to the connection request (i.e., the\n\
    \      gateway can \"Ack\" right away without waiting for the reservation\n  \
    \    to complete and a provisional response will not be necessary).\n   Resource\
    \ Sharing LocalConnectionOption:\n      It may be possible to share network resources\
    \ across multiple\n      connections.  An example is a call-waiting scenario,\
    \ where only\n      one connection will ever be active at a time.  In a 3-way\
    \ calling\n      scenario with a similar set of connections, sharing is not\n\
    \      possible.  Only the Call Agent knows what may be possible,\n      depending\
    \ on the feature that is being invoked.\n      In order to allow the Call Agent\
    \ to indicate that sharing is\n      possible, a resource sharing LocalConnectionOption\
    \ parameter is\n      introduced.  This parameter can have one of the following\
    \ values:\n         *  A value \"$\" can be specified where $ refers to \"this\n\
    \            connection\".  This value is used when doing a create\n         \
    \   connection and indicates the intent to share resources with\n            this\
    \ connection.\n         *  A connection ID can be specified which indicates that\
    \ this\n            is a request to share resources with the connection having\n\
    \            this connection ID (allowing multiple connections to share\n    \
    \        resources with the connection indicated).\n         *  The value can\
    \ be empty, which indicates a request to no\n            longer share the resources\
    \ of this connection with other\n            connections.\n      In the case of\
    \ a CRCX, the default value for the resource sharing\n      local connection option\
    \ is empty, and for an MDCX, the default\n      value is its current value.\n\
    \   The RSVP filters will be deduced from the characteristics of the\n   connection.\
    \  The RSVP resource profiles will be deduced from the\n   connection's bandwidth\
    \ and packetization period.\n   Note that if RSVP is used with PacketCable Dynamic\
    \ Quality of Service\n   [35], then the parameters in NCS [36] would be used instead\
    \ of the\n   reservation direction, confirmation and reservation sharing\n   parameters\
    \ described here.\n"

    \                     name1=value1,name2=value2,...)\n   where <status> can have\
    \ one of the values \"success\" or \"failure\".\n   This is then followed by output\
    \ parameters as a comma-separated list\n   of name-value pairs.\n   Intermediate\
    \ Result/Request (ir(<params>)):\n      This provides a way for:\n         * \
    \ The script to inform the Call Agent of intermediate results\n            (e.g.,\
    \ a case where it is important because of timing\n            concerns to inform\
    \ the Call Agent prior to operation\n            complete).\n         *  The script\
    \ to request some information from the Call Agent.\n         *  The Call Agent\
    \ to inform the script of some event or\n            information that may be important\
    \ for the operation of the\n            script (in this case \"ir\" is used as\
    \ a signal).\n      Parameters (i.e., <params>) SHOULD be a comma-separated list\
    \ of\n      name-value pairs e.g., ir(name1=value1,name2=value2,..).  The Call\n\
    \      Agent MAY include event parameters when it requests this event, in\n  \
    \    which case, the MGCP syntax requirements require that the action\n      be\
    \ specified (e.g., \"R: ir(N)(nam1=value1,name2=value2,..)\").\n      If the Call\
    \ Agent requests \"ir\" as a signal, at least one\n      parameter MUST be provided.\n\
    \      When requesting the \"ir\" signal, the Call Agent MUST also repeat\n  \
    \    the original script signal.  This is in order to be consistent\n      with\
    \ the semantics of TO signals in MGCP (i.e., if the original\n      \"script\"\
    \ signal is not included, then the signal/script will be\n      stopped).  The\
    \ only problem with this is that there is a possible\n      race condition in\
    \ which a request to send an \"ir\" signal could\n      occur just as the script\
    \ stopped.  In order to avoid this\n      confusion, the following is RECOMMENDED:\
    \ when the script signal is\n      included with an \"ir\" signal, include a parameter\
    \ (of the script\n      signal) to indicate that this is not a new instance of\
    \ the script\n      i.e., if there is no script executing at the present time\
    \ do not\n      start executing a new one.\n      The \"ir\" signal is only associated\
    \ with an executing script.  If\n      none are running when a request for the\
    \ event/signal is made, or\n      if a new script request is not included with\
    \ the request, then the\n      \"ir\" signal/event will not be executed (i.e.,\
    \ the \"ir\" event with\n      its parameters is passed to an existing script\
    \ for parsing and\n      execution and is considered opaque as far as MGCP as\
    \ concerned.\n      If no such script exists, response code \"800\" will be returned,\n\
    \      indicating that the script is not executing).\n   The following response\
    \ code is associated with this package:\n      Code    Text                 Explanation\n\
    \      800     Script not           Request for \"ir\" signal or event\n     \
    \         Executing            but no script is executing at the\n           \
    \                        time the request was received.\n      Note that package\
    \ specific error codes include the package name\n      following the error code.\
    \  For example, if error code 800 occurs\n      in response to a request with\
    \ a transaction ID of 1001, it would\n      be sent as:\n         800 1001 /SCRIPT\n"
