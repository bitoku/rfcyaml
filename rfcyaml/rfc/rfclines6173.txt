Management Information Base (MIB) objects to monitor and control the Internet Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP)
gateway instances and their associated sessions, for use with network management protocols.
This document obsoletes RFC 4369.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
(RFC 4172 [RFC4172]) provides Fibre Channel fabric functionality on an IP network in which TCP/IP switching and routing elements replace Fibre Channel components.
iFCP is used between iFCP gateways.
This protocol can be used by FC to IP based storage gateways for Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) storage interconnects.
Figure 1 provides an example of an interconnect between iFCP gateways.
iFCP Gateways The iFCP MIB module is designed to allow a network management protocol such as SNMP to be used to monitor and manage local iFCP gateway instances, including the configuration of iFCP sessions between gateways.
The iFCP MIB module is divided into sections for iFCP local gateway instance management, iFCP session management, and iFCP session statistics.
The section for iFCP gateway management provides default settings and information about each local instance.
A single management entity can monitor multiple local gateway instances.
Each local gateway is conceptually an independent gateway that has both Fibre Channel and IP interfaces.
The default IP Time Out Value (IP TOV) is configurable for each gateway.
Other standard MIBs, such as the Fibre Management MIB [RFC4044] or Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863], can be used to manage non iFCP specific gateway parameters.
The local gateway instance section provides iFCP specific information as well as optional links to other standard management MIBs.
The iFCP session management section provides information on iFCP sessions that use one of the local iFCP gateway instances.
This section allows the management of specific iFCP parameters, including changing the IP TOV from the default setting of the gateway.
The iFCP session statistics section provides statistical information on the iFCP sessions that use one of the local iFCP gateways.
These tables augment the session management table.
Additional statistical information for an iFCP gateway or session
, that is not iFCP  specific, can be obtained using other standard MIBs.
The iFCP statistics are provided in both high capacity (Counter64) and low  capacity (Counter32) methods.
The following MIB module imports from SNMPv2 SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2 TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2 CONF [RFC2580], HCNUM TC
IF MIB [RFC2863], SNMP FRAMEWORK MIB [RFC3411], INET ADDRESS MIB [RFC4001], FC MGMT MIB
[RFC4044], ENTITY MIB (v3) [RFC4133], and RMON2 MIB [RFC4502].
As explained in [RFC6172], the iFCP address translation mode is deprecated.
This document obsoletes the iFCP MIB module [RFC4369] for this change.

"The maximum propagation delay, in seconds, for an encapsulated FC frame to traverse the IP network.
A value of 0 implies fibre channel frame lifetime limits will not be enforced.
"The value for the Liveness Test Interval (LTI) being used in an iFCP connection, in seconds.
A value of 0 implies no Liveness Test Interval will be used.
"The value for an iFCP session state."

This table contains an entry for each local iFCP gateway instance that is being managed."
"An entry in the local iFCP gateway instance table.
Parameters and settings for the gateway are found here.
"An arbitrary integer value to uniquely identify this iFCP gateway from other local gateway instances."
"An index indicating the location of this local gateway within a larger entity, if one exists.
If supported, this is the entPhysicalIndex from the Entity MIB (Version 3), for this iFCP gateway.
If not supported, or if not related to a physical entity, then the value of this object is 0.
"The minimum iFCP protocol version supported by the local iFCP gateway instance.
"The maximum iFCP protocol version supported by the local iFCP gateway instance.
The local iFCP gateway operating mode.
Changing this value may cause existing sessions to be disrupted.
"This value indicates whether the local iFCP gateway supports FC Broadcast.
Changing this value may cause existing sessions to be disrupted.
"The default IP TOV used for iFCP sessions at this gateway.
This is the default maximum propagation delay that will be used for an iFCP session.
The value can be changed on a per session basis.
The valid range is 0 3600 seconds.
A value of 0 implies that fibre channel frame lifetime limits will not be enforced.
"The default Liveness Test Interval (LTI), in seconds, used for iFCP sessions at this gateway.
This is the default value for an iFCP session and can be changed on a per session basis.
The valid range is 0 65535 seconds.
A value of 0 implies no Liveness Test Interval will be performed on a session.
"A user entered description for this iFCP gateway."
"The storage type for this row.
Parameter values defined for a gateway are usually non volatile, but may be volatile or permanent in some configurations.
If permanent, then the following parameters must have read write access: ifcpLclGtwyInstAddrTransMode,
An iFCP session consists of the pair of N PORTs comprising the session endpoints joined by a single TCP/IP connection.
This table provides information on each iFCP session currently using a local iFCP gateway instance.
iFCP sessions are created and removed by the iFCP gateway instances, which are reflected in this table."
"Each entry contains information about one iFCP session consisting of a pair of N PORTs joined by a single TCP/IP connection.
This table's INDEX includes ifcpLclGtwyInstIndex, which identifies the local iFCP gateway instance that created the session for the entry.
Soon after an entry is created in this table for an iFCP session, it will correspond to an entry in the tcpConnectionTable of the TCP MIB (RFC 4022).
The corresponding entry might represent a preexisting TCP connection, or it might be a newly created entry.
(Note that if IPv4 is being used, an entry in RFC 2012's tcpConnTable may also correspond.)
The values of ifcpSessionLclPrtlAddrType and ifcpSessionRmtPrtlIfAddrType in this table and the values of tcpConnectionLocalAddressType and tcpConnectionRemAddressType used as INDEX values for the corresponding entry in the tcpConnectionTable should be the same; this makes it simpler to locate a session's TCP connection in the TCP MIB.
(Of course, all four values need to be 'ipv4'
if there's a corresponding entry in the tcpConnTable.)
If an entry is created in this table for a session, prior to knowing which local and/or remote port numbers will be used for the TCP connection, then ifcpSessionLclPrtlTcpPort and/or ifcpSessionRmtPrtlTcpPort have the value zero until such time as they can be updated to the port numbers (to be) used for the connection.
(Thus, a port value of zero should not be used to locate a session's TCP connection in the TCP MIB.)
When the TCP connection terminates, the entry in the tcpConnectionTable and the entry in this table both get deleted (and, if applicable, so does the entry in the tcpConnTable).
The iFCP session index is a unique value used as an index to the table, along with a specific local iFCP gateway instance.
This index is used because the local N Port and remote N Port information would create a complex index that would be difficult to implement."
"This is the interface index in the IF MIB ifTable being used as the local portal in this session, as described in the IF MIB.
If the local portal is not associated with an entry in the ifTable, then the value is 0.
The ifType of the interface will generally be a type that supports IP, but an implementation may support iFCP using other protocols.
This object can be used to obtain additional information about the interface.
"The type of address in ifcpSessionLclIfAddr."
"This is the external IP address of the interface being used for the iFCP local portal in this session.
The address type is defined in ifcpSessionLclPrtlAddrType.
If the value is a DNS name, then the name is resolved once, during the initial session instantiation."
"This is the TCP port number that is being used for the iFCP local portal in this session.
This is normally an ephemeral port number selected by the gateway.
The value may be 0 during an initial setup period."
"World Wide Unique Name of the local N Port.
For an unbound session, this variable will be a zero length string.
Fibre Channel Identifier of the local N Port.
For an unbound session, this variable will be a zero length string.
"World Wide Unique Name of the remote N Port.
For an unbound session, this variable will be a zero length string.
"The type of address in ifcpSessionRmtPrtlIfAddr."
"This is the remote gateway IP address being used for the portal on the remote iFCP gateway.
The address type is defined in ifcpSessionRmtPrtlIfAddrType.
If the value is a DNS name, then the name is resolved once, during the initial session instantiation."
"This is the TCP port number being used for the portal on the remote iFCP gateway.
Generally, this will be the iFCP canonical port.
The value may be 0 during an initial setup period."
Fibre Channel Identifier of the remote N Port.
For an unbound session, this variable will be a zero length string.
"Fibre Channel Identifier Alias assigned by the local gateway for the remote N Port.
For an unbound session, this variable will be a zero length string.
"The IP TOV being used for this iFCP session.
This is the maximum propagation delay that will be used for the iFCP session.
The value can be changed on a per session basis and initially defaults to ifcpLclGtwyInstDefaultIpTOV for the local gateway instance.
The valid range is 0 3600 seconds.
A value of 0 implies fibre channel frame lifetime limits will not be enforced.
The value can be changed on a per session basis and initially defaults to ifcpLclGtwyInstDefaultLTInterval for the local gateway instance.
The valid range is 0 65535 seconds.
A value of 0 implies that the gateway will not originate Liveness Test messages for the session.
This value may change over the life of the session.
The valid range is 0 65535 seconds.
A value of 0 implies that the remote gateway has not been requested to originate Liveness Test messages for the session.
"This value indicates whether this session is bound to a specific local and remote N Port.
Sessions by default are unbound and ready for future assignment to a local and remote N Port.
"The storage type for this row.
Parameter values defined for a session are usually non volatile, but may be volatile or permanent in some configurations.
If permanent, then ifcpSessionIpTOV must have read write access."
"This table provides statistics on an iFCP session."
"Provides iFCP specific statistics per session."
"The current session operating state."
"This indicates, in seconds, how long the iFCP session has been in an open or open pending state.
When a session is down, the value is reset to 0."
"The total number of octets transmitted by the iFCP gateway for this session.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at reinitialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifcpSessionDiscontinuityTime."
"The total number of octets received by the iFCP gateway for this session.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at reinitialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifcpSessionDiscontinuityTime."
"The total number of iFCP frames transmitted by the gateway for this session.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at reinitialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifcpSessionDiscontinuityTime."
"The total number of iFCP frames received by the gateway for this session.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at reinitialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifcpSessionDiscontinuityTime."
"The total number of received iFCP frames that were stale and discarded by the gateway for this session.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at reinitialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifcpSessionDiscontinuityTime."
"The total number of Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) errors that occurred in the frame header, detected by the gateway for this session.
Usually, a single Header CRC error is sufficient to terminate an iFCP session.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at reinitialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifcpSessionDiscontinuityTime."
"The total number of CRC errors that occurred in the Fibre Channel frame payload, detected by the gateway for this session.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at reinitialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifcpSessionDiscontinuityTime."
"The total number of errors, other than errors explicitly measured, detected by the gateway for this session.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at reinitialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifcpSessionDiscontinuityTime."
"The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one (or more) of the ifcpSessionStatsTable counters suffered a discontinuity.
The relevant counters are the specific Counter64 based instances associated with the ifcpSessionStatsTable: ifcpSessionTxOctets, ifcpSessionRxOctets, ifcpSessionTxFrames, ifcpSessionRxFrames, ifcpSessionStaleFrames, ifcpSessionHeaderCRCErrors, ifcpSessionFcPayloadCRCErrors, and ifcpSessionOtherErrors.
If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last reinitialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value."
"This table provides low capacity statistics for an iFCP session.
These are provided for backward compatibility with systems that do not support Counter64 based objects.
At 1 Gbps rates, a Counter32 based object can wrap as often as every 34 seconds.
Counter32 based objects can be sufficient for many situations.
However, when possible, it is recommended to use the high capacity statistics in ifcpSessionStatsTable based on Counter64 objects."
"The total number of CRC errors that occurred in the frame header, detected by the gateway for this session.
Usually, a single Header CRC error is sufficient to terminate an iFCP session."

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Changing the following object values, with a MAX ACCESS of read  write, may cause disruption in storage traffic: ifcpLclGtwyInstAddrTransMode
ifcpLclGtwyInstDefaultLTInterval ifcpSessionIpTOV Changing the following object value, with a MAX ACCESS of read write, may cause a user to lose track of the iFCP gateway: ifcpLclGtwyInstDescr
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
The following object tables provide information about storage traffic sessions, and can indicate to a user who is communicating and exchanging storage data: ifcpLclGtwyInstTable ifcpSessionAttributesTable SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
