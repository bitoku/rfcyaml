  - "IESG Note\n   The following documents  (RFC 4405, RFC 4406, RFC 4407, and RFC\
    \ 4408)\n   are published simultaneously as Experimental RFCs, although there\
    \ is\n   no general technical consensus and efforts to reconcile the two\n   approaches\
    \ have failed.  As such, these documents have not received\n   full IETF review\
    \ and are published \"AS-IS\" to document the different\n   approaches as they\
    \ were considered in the MARID working group.\n   The IESG takes no position about\
    \ which approach is to be preferred\n   and cautions the reader that there are\
    \ serious open issues for each\n   approach and concerns about using them in tandem.\
    \  The IESG believes\n   that documenting the different approaches does less harm\
    \ than not\n   documenting them.\n   Note that the Sender ID experiment may use\
    \ DNS records that may have\n   been created for the current SPF experiment or\
    \ earlier versions in\n   this set of experiments.  Depending on the content of\
    \ the record,\n   this may mean that Sender-ID heuristics would be applied incorrectly\n\
    \   to a message.  Depending on the actions associated by the recipient\n   with\
    \ those heuristics, the message may not be delivered or may be\n   discarded on\
    \ receipt.\n   Participants relying on Sender ID experiment DNS records are warned\n\
    \   that they may lose valid messages in this set of circumstances.\n   Participants\
    \ publishing SPF experiment DNS records should consider\n   the advice given in\
    \ section 3.4 of RFC 4406 and may wish to publish\n   both v=spf1 and spf2.0 records\
    \ to avoid the conflict.\n   Participants in the Sender-ID experiment need to\
    \ be aware that the\n   way Resent-* header fields are used will result in failure\
    \ to receive\n   legitimate email when interacting with standards-compliant systems\n\
    \   (specifically automatic forwarders which comply with the standards by\n  \
    \ not adding Resent-* headers, and systems which comply with RFC 822\n   but have\
    \ not yet implemented RFC 2822 Resent-* semantics).  It would\n   be inappropriate\
    \ to advance Sender-ID on the standards track without\n   resolving this interoperability\
    \ problem.\n   The community is invited to observe the success or failure of the\
    \ two\n   approaches during the two years following publication, in order that\n\
    \   a community consensus can be reached in the future.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Most e-mail flows relatively directly from a sender to a\
    \ recipient,\n   with a small number of Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) in between.\
    \  Some\n   messages, however, are resent by forwarding agents, mailing list\n\
    \   servers, and other such software.  These messages effectively result\n   in\
    \ two or more mail transactions: one from the sender to the\n   forwarding agent,\
    \ and another from the agent to the destination.\n   In some cases, messages travel\
    \ through more than one of these agents.\n   This can occur, for example, when\
    \ one mailing list is subscribed to\n   another, or when the address subscribed\
    \ to a mailing list is a\n   forwarding service.\n   Further complicating the\
    \ situation, in some cases the party that\n   introduces a message is not the\
    \ author of the message.  For example,\n   many news web sites have a \"Mail this\
    \ article\" function that the\n   public can use to e-mail a copy of the article\
    \ to a friend.  In this\n   case, the mail is \"from\" the person who pressed\
    \ the button, but is\n   physically sent by the operator of the web site.\n  \
    \ This document defines a new identity associated with an e-mail\n   message,\
    \ called the Purported Responsible Address (PRA), which is\n   determined by inspecting\
    \ the header of the message.  The PRA is\n   designed to be the entity that (according\
    \ to the header) most\n   recently caused the message to be delivered.\n   Note\
    \ that the results of this algorithm are only as truthful as the\n   headers contained\
    \ in the message; if a message contains fraudulent or\n   incorrect headers, this\
    \ algorithm will yield an incorrect result.\n   For this reason, the result of\
    \ the algorithm is called the \"Purported\n   Responsible Address\" -- \"purported\"\
    \ because it tells you what a\n   message claims about where it came from, but\
    \ not necessarily where it\n   actually came from.\n   This document does not\
    \ prescribe any particular uses for the\n   Purported Responsible Address.  However,\
    \ [RFC4406] describes a method\n   of determining whether a particular MTA is\
    \ authorized to send mail on\n   behalf of the domain contained in the PRA.\n"

- title: 2.  Determining the Purported Responsible Address
  contents:
  - "2.  Determining the Purported Responsible Address\n   The PRA of a message is\
    \ determined by the following algorithm:\n   1. Select the first non-empty Resent-Sender\
    \ header in the message.\n      If no such header is found, continue with step\
    \ 2.  If it is\n      preceded by a non-empty Resent-From header and one or more\n\
    \      Received or Return-Path headers occur after said Resent-From\n      header\
    \ and before the Resent-Sender header, continue with step 2.\n      Otherwise,\
    \ proceed to step 5.\n   2. Select the first non-empty Resent-From header in the\
    \ message.  If\n      a Resent-From header is found, proceed to step 5.  Otherwise,\n\
    \      continue with step 3.\n   3. Select all the non-empty Sender headers in\
    \ the message.  If there\n      are no such headers, continue with step 4.  If\
    \ there is exactly\n      one such header, proceed to step 5.  If there is more\
    \ than one\n      such header, proceed to step 6.\n   4. Select all the non-empty\
    \ From headers in the message.  If there is\n      exactly one such header, continue\
    \ with step 5.  Otherwise, proceed\n      to step 6.\n   5. A previous step has\
    \ selected a single header from the message.  If\n      that header is malformed\
    \ (e.g., it appears to contain multiple\n      mailboxes, or the single mailbox\
    \ is hopelessly malformed, or the\n      single mailbox does not contain a domain\
    \ name), continue with step\n      6.  Otherwise, return that single mailbox as\
    \ the Purported\n      Responsible Address.\n   6. The message is ill-formed,\
    \ and it is impossible to determine a\n      Purported Responsible Address.\n\
    \   For the purposes of this algorithm, a header field is \"non-empty\" if\n \
    \  and only if it contains any non-whitespace characters.  Header fields\n   that\
    \ are otherwise relevant but contain only whitespace are ignored\n   and treated\
    \ as if they were not present.\n   Note that steps 1 and 2 above extract the Resent-Sender\
    \ or Resent-\n   From header from the first resent block (as defined by section\
    \ 3.6.6\n   of [RFC2822]) if any.  Steps 3 and 4 above extract the Sender or From\n\
    \   header if there are no resent blocks.\n   Note that what constitutes a hopelessly\
    \ malformed header or a\n   hopelessly malformed mailbox in step 5 above is a\
    \ matter for local\n   policy.  Such local policy will never cause two implementations\
    \ to\n   return different PRAs.  However, it may cause one implementation to\n\
    \   return a PRA where another implementation does not.  This will occur\n   only\
    \ when dealing with a message containing headers of questionable\n   legality.\n\
    \   Although the algorithm specifies how messages that are not in strict\n   conformance\
    \ with the provisions of RFC 2822 should be treated for the\n   purposes of determining\
    \ the PRA, this should not be taken as\n   requiring or recommending that any\
    \ systems accept such messages when\n   they otherwise would not have done so.\
    \  However, if a liberal\n   implementation accepts such messages and desires\
    \ to know their PRAs,\n   it MUST use the algorithm specified here.\n   Where\
    \ messages conform to RFC 822 rather than RFC 2822, it is\n   possible for the\
    \ algorithm to give unexpected results.  An RFC822\n   message should not normally\
    \ contain more than one set of resent\n   headers; however, the placement of those\
    \ headers is not specified,\n   nor are they required to be contiguous.  It is\
    \ therefore possible\n   that the Resent-From header will be selected even though\
    \ a Resent-\n   Sender header is present.  Such cases are expected to be rare\
    \ or\n   non-existent in practice.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The PRA, as described by this document, is extracted\
    \ from message\n   headers that have historically not been verified.  Thus, anyone\
    \ using\n   the PRA for any purpose MUST be aware that the headers from which\
    \ it\n   is derived might be fraudulent, malicious, malformed, and/or\n   incorrect.\
    \  [RFC4406] describes one mechanism for validating the PRA.\n   A message's PRA\
    \ will often be extracted from a header field that is\n   not normally displayed\
    \ by existing mail user agent software.  If the\n   PRA is used as part of a mechanism\
    \ to authenticate the message's\n   origin, the message SHOULD NOT be displayed\
    \ with an indication of its\n   authenticity (positive or negative) without the\
    \ PRA header field also\n   being displayed.\n"
