  - "Abstract\n   This document describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a scenario\n
    \  that has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network\n   that
    is assumed to implement BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host\n   has multiple
    routers to choose from.  It also applies to other\n   scenarios such as the usage
    of stateful firewalls that effectively\n   act as address-based filters.  Host
    behavior in choosing a first-hop\n   router may interact with source address selection
    in a given\n   implementation.  However, the selection of the source address for
    a\n   packet is done before the first-hop router for that packet is chosen.\n
    \  Given that the network or host is, or appears to be, multihomed with\n   multiple
    provider-allocated addresses, that the host has elected to\n   use a source address
    in a given prefix, and that some but not all\n   neighboring routers are advertising
    that prefix in their Router\n   Advertisement Prefix Information Options, this
    document specifies to\n   which router a host should present its transmission.

  - "1.  Introduction and Applicability\n   This document describes the expected behavior
    of an IPv6 [RFC2460]\n   host in a network that has more than one prefix, each
    allocated by an\n   upstream network that is assumed to implement BCP 38 [RFC2827]\n
    \  ingress filtering, and in which the host is presented with a choice\n   of
    routers.  It expects that the network will implement some form of\n   egress routing,
    so that packets sent to a host outside the local\n   network from a given ISP's
    prefix will go to that ISP.  If the packet\n   is sent to the wrong egress, it
    is liable to be discarded by the BCP\n   38 filter.  However, the mechanics of
    egress routing once the packet\n   leaves the host are out of scope.  The question
    here is how the host\n   interacts with that network.\n   Various aspects of this
    issue, and possible solution approaches, are\n   discussed in \"IPv6 Multihoming
    without Network Address Translation\"\n   [RFC7157].\n   BCP 38 filtering by ISPs
    is not the only scenario where such behavior\n   is valuable.  Implementations
    that combine existing recommendations,\n   such as [RFC6092] and [RFC7084] can
    also result in such filtering.\n   Another case is when the connections to the
    upstream networks include\n   stateful firewalls, such that return packets in
    a stream will be\n   discarded if they do not return via the firewall that created
    the\n   state for the outgoing packets.  A similar cause of such discards is\n
    \  unicast reverse path forwarding (uRPF) [RFC3704].\n   In this document, the
    term \"filter\" is used for simplicity to cover\n   all such cases.  In any case,
    one cannot assume that the host is\n   aware whether an ingress filter, a stateful
    firewall, or any other\n   type of filter is in place.  Therefore, the only known
    consistent\n   solution is to implement the features defined in this document.\n
    \  Note that, apart from ensuring that a message with a given source\n   address
    is given to a first-hop router that appears to know about the\n   prefix in question,
    this specification is consistent with [RFC4861].\n   Nevertheless, implementers
    of Sections 6.2.3, 6.3.4, 6.3.6, and 8.1\n   of RFC 4861 should extend their implementations
    accordingly.  This\n   specification is fully consistent with [RFC6724] and depends
    on\n   support for its Rule 5.5 (see Section 3.3).  Hosts that do not\n   support
    these features may fail to communicate in the presence of\n   filters as described
    above.\n"

    - "1.1.  Host Model\n   It could be argued that the proposal in this document,
      which is to\n   send messages using a source address in a given prefix to the
      router\n   that advertised the prefix in its Router Advertisement (RA), is a\n
      \  form of the Strong End System (ES, e.g., Host) model, discussed in\n   Section
      3.3.4.2 of [RFC1122].  In short, [RFC1122] identifies two\n   basic models.
      \ First, the \"strong host\" model describes the host as a\n   set of hosts
      in one chassis, each of which uses a single address on a\n   single interface
      and always both sends and receives on that\n   interface.  Alternatively, the
      \"weak host\" model treats the host as\n   one system with zero or more addresses
      on every interface and is\n   capable of using any interface for any communication.
      \ As noted\n   there, neither model is completely satisfactory.  For example,
      a host\n   with a link-local-only interface and a default route pointing to
      that\n   interface will necessarily send packets using that interface but with\n
      \  a source address derived from some other interface, and will\n   therefore
      be a de facto weak host.  If the router upstream from such\n   a host implements
      BCP 38 Ingress Filtering [RFC2827], such as by\n   implementing uRPF on each
      interface, the router might prevent\n   communication by weak hosts.\n                +-----------------+\n

      MIF Interconnection\n   The proposal also differs slightly from the language
      in [RFC1122] for\n   the Strong Host model.  The proposal is that the packet
      will go to a\n   router that advertised a given prefix but that does not specify
      what\n   interface that might happen on.  Hence, if the router is a multi-\n
      \  interface (MIF) router and it is using a common prefix spanning two\n   or
      more LANs shared by the host (as in Figure 1), the host might use\n   either
      of those LANs, according to this proposal.  The Strong Host\n   model is not
      stated in those terms, but in terms of the interface\n   used.  A strong host
      would treat such an MIF router as two separate\n   routers when obeying the
      rules from RFC 1122 as they apply in the\n   Strong case:\n   (A)  A host MUST
      silently discard an incoming datagram whose\n        destination address does
      not correspond to the physical\n        interface through which it is received.\n
      \  (B)  A host MUST restrict itself to sending (non-source-routed) IP\n        datagrams
      only through the physical interface that corresponds\n        to the IP source
      address of the datagrams.\n   However, when comparing the presumptive route
      lookup mechanisms in\n   each model, this proposal is indeed most similar to
      the Strong Host\n   model, as is any source/destination routing paradigm.\n
      \  Strong:  route (src IP addr, dest IP addr, TOS) -> gateway\n   Weak:  route
      (dest IP addr, TOS) -> gateway, interface\n   In the hypothetical MIF model
      suggested in Figure 1, the address\n   fails to identify a single interface,
      but it does identify a single\n   gateway.\n"

    - "2.1.  Expectations the Host Has of the Network\n   A host receives prefixes
      in a Router Advertisement [RFC4861], which\n   goes on to identify whether they
      are usable by Stateless Address\n   Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862]  with
      any type of interface\n   identifier [RFC4941] [RFC7217].  When no prefixes
      are usable for\n   SLAAC, the Router Advertisement would normally signal the\n
      \  availability of DHCPv6 [RFC3315] and the host would use it to\n   configure
      its addresses.  In the latter case (or if both SLAAC and\n   DHCPv6 are used
      on the same link for some reason), the configured\n   addresses generally match
      one of the prefixes advertised in a Router\n   Advertisement that are supposed
      to be on-link for that link.\n   The simplest multihomed network implementation
      in which a host makes\n   choices among routers might be a LAN with one or more
      hosts on it and\n   two or more routers, one for each upstream network, or a
      host that is\n   served by disjoint networks on separate interfaces.  In such
      a\n   network, especially the latter, there is not necessarily a routing\n   protocol,
      and the two routers may not even know that the other is a\n   router as opposed
      to a host, or may be configured to ignore its\n   presence.  One might expect
      that the routers may or may not receive\n   each other's RAs and form an address
      in the other router's prefix\n   (which is not per [RFC4862], but is implemented
      by some stub router\n   implementations).  However, all hosts in such a network
      might be\n   expected to create an address in each prefix so advertised.\n          +---------+

      Host)\n                       Figure 2: Two Simple Networks\n   If there is
      no routing protocol among those routers, there is no\n   mechanism by which
      packets can be deterministically forwarded between\n   the routers (as described
      in BCP 84 [RFC3704]) in order to avoid\n   filters.  Even if there was routing,
      it would result in an indirect\n   route, rather than a direct route originating
      with the host; this is\n   not \"wrong\", but can be inefficient.  Therefore,
      the host would do\n   well to select the appropriate router itself.\n   Since
      the host derives fundamental default routing information from\n   the Router
      Advertisement, this implies that, in any network with\n   hosts using multiple
      prefixes, each prefix SHOULD be advertised via a\n   Prefix Information Option
      (PIO) [RFC4861] by one of the attached\n   routers, even if addresses are being
      assigned using DHCPv6.  A router\n   that advertises a prefix indicates that
      it is able to appropriately\n   route packets with source addresses within that
      prefix, regardless of\n   the setting of the L and A flags in the PIO.\n   In
      some circumstances, both L and A might be zero.  If SLAAC is not\n   wanted
      (A=0) and there is no reason to announce an on-link prefix\n   (L=0), a PIO
      SHOULD be sent to inform hosts that they should use the\n   router in question
      as the first hop for packets with source addresses\n   in the PIO prefix.  An
      example case is the MIF router in Figure 1,\n   which could send PIOs with A=L=0
      for the common prefix.  Although\n   this does not violate the existing standard
      [RFC4861], such a PIO has\n   not previously been common, and it is possible
      that existing host\n   implementations simply ignore such a PIO or that existing
      router\n   implementations are not capable of sending such a PIO.  Newer\n   implementations
      that support this mechanism should be updated\n   accordingly:\n   o  A host
      SHOULD NOT ignore a PIO simply because both L and A flags\n      are cleared
      (extending Section 6.3.4 of [RFC4861]).\n   o  A router SHOULD be able to send
      such a PIO (extending\n      Section 6.2.3 of [RFC4861]).\n"

      Options (PIOs) or zero or\n   more Route Information Options (RIOs).  In their

      \ |\n                 Figure 3: PIOs, RIOs, and Default Routes\n   The implications
      bear consideration.  Imagine, Figure 3, that hosts\n   Alice and Bob are in
      communication.  Bob's network consists of at\n   least Bob (the computer), two
      routers (Bob-A and Bob-B), and the\n   links between them; it may be much larger,
      for example, a campus or\n   corporate network.  Bob's network is therefore
      multihomed, and Bob's\n   first-hop routers are Bob-A (to the upstream ISP A
      advertising prefix\n   PA) and Bob-B (to the upstream network B and advertising
      prefix PB).\n   We assume that Bob is not applying Rule 5.5 of [RFC6724].  If
      Bob is\n   responding to a message from Alice, his choice of source address
      is\n   forced to be the address Alice used as a destination (which we may\n
      \  presume to have been in prefix PA).  Hence, Bob either created or was\n   assigned
      an address in PA, and can only reasonably send traffic using\n   it to Bob-A
      as a first-hop router.  If there are several routers in\n   Bob's network advertising
      the prefix PA (referred to as \"Bob-Ax\"\n   routers), then Bob should choose
      its first-hop router only from among\n   those routers.  From among the multiple
      Bob-Ax routers, Bob should\n   choose the first-hop router based on the criteria
      specified in\n   Section 3 of [RFC4191].  If none of the Bob-Ax routers has
      advertised\n   an RA with a non-zero Router Lifetime or an RIO with a non-zero
      Route\n   Lifetime that includes Alice, but router Bob-B has, it is irrelevant.\n
      \  Bob is using the address allocated in PA and courts a BCP 38 discard\n   if
      he doesn't send the packet to Bob-A.\n   In the special case that Bob is initiating
      the conversation, an RIO\n   might, however, influence source address choice.
      \ Bob could\n   presumably use any address allocated to him, in this case, his\n
      \  address in PA or PB.  If Bob-B has advertised an RIO for Alice's\n   prefix
      and Bob-A has not, Bob MAY take that fact into account in\n   address selection
      -- choosing an address that would allow him to make\n   use of the RIO.\n"

      for each prefix it is\n   assigned an address in.  Routers that have advertised
      the prefix in\n   their Router Advertisement message SHOULD be preferred over
      routers\n   that do not advertise the prefix, regardless of Default Router\n
      \  Preference.  Note that this document does not change the way in which\n   default
      router preferences are communicated [RFC4191].\n   If no router has advertised
      the prefix in an RA, normal routing\n   metrics will apply.  An example is a
      host connected to the Internet\n   via one router, and at the same time connected
      by a VPN to a private\n   domain that is also connected to the global Internet.\n
      \  As a result of this, when a host sends a packet using a source\n   address
      in one of those prefixes and has no history directing it\n   otherwise, it SHOULD
      send it to the indicated default router.  In the\n   \"simplest\" network described
      in Section 2.1, that would get it to the\n   only router that is directly capable
      of getting it to the right ISP.\n   This will also apply in more complex networks,
      even when more than\n   one physical or virtual interface is involved.\n   In
      more complex cases, wherein routers advertise RAs for multiple\n   prefixes
      whether or not they have direct or isolated upstream\n   connectivity, the host
      is dependent on the routing system already.\n   If the host gives the packet
      to a router advertising its source\n   prefix, it should be able to depend on
      the router to do the right\n   thing.\n"

    - "3.3.  Source Address Selection\n   There is an interaction with Default Address
      Selection [RFC6724].  A\n   host following the recommendation in the previous
      section will store\n   information about which next hops advertised which prefixes.
      \ Rule\n   5.5 of RFC 6724 states that the source address used to send to a\n
      \  given destination address should, if possible, be chosen from a\n   prefix
      known to be advertised by the next-hop router for that\n   destination.  Therefore,
      this selection rule SHOULD be implemented in\n   a host following the recommendation
      in the previous section.\n"

      Redirect\n   (Redirect for a destination that is not on-link) message sent by
      a\n   router in accordance with Section 8 of [RFC4861].  Hosts SHOULD apply\n
      \  off-link redirects only for the specific pair of source and\n   destination
      addresses concerned, so the host's Destination Cache\n   might need to contain
      appropriate source-specific entries.  This\n   extends the validity check specified
      in Section 8.1 of [RFC4861].\n"

    - "3.5.  History\n   Some modern hosts maintain history, in terms of what has
      previously\n   worked or not worked for a given address or prefix and in some
      cases\n   the effective window and Maximum Segment Size (MSS) values for TCP
      or\n   other protocols.  This might include a next-hop address for use when\n
      \  a packet is sent to the indicated address.\n   When such a host makes a successful
      exchange with a remote\n   destination using a particular address pair, and
      the host has\n   previously received a PIO that matches the source address,
      then the\n   host SHOULD include the prefix in such history, whatever the setting\n
      \  of the L and A flags in the PIO.  On subsequent attempts to\n   communicate
      with that destination, if it has an address in that\n   prefix at that time,
      a host MAY use an address in the remembered\n   prefix for the session.\n"

  - "4.  Residual Issues\n   Consider a network where routers on a link run a routing
    protocol and\n   are configured with the same information.  Thus, on each link,
    all\n   routers advertise all prefixes on that link.  The assumption that\n   packets
    will be forwarded to the appropriate egress by the local\n   routing system might
    cause at least one extra hop in the local\n   network (from the host to the wrong
    router, and from there to another\n   router on the same link).\n   In a slightly
    more complex situation such as the disjoint LAN case of\n   Figure 2, for example,
    a home plus corporate home-office\n   configuration, the two upstream routers
    might be on different LANs\n   and therefore different subnets (e.g., the host
    is itself\n   multihomed).  In that case, there is no way for the \"wrong\" router
    to\n   detect the existence of the \"right\" router, or to route to it.\n   In
    such a case, it is particularly important that hosts take the\n   responsibility
    to memorize and select the best first hop as described\n   in Section 3.\n"

    issues in the\n   presence of BCP 38 ingress filters or stateful firewalls combined\n
    \  with multihoming.  It does not, in itself, create any new security or\n   privacy
    exposures.  However, since the solution is designed to ensure\n   that routing
    occurs correctly in situations where it previously\n   failed, this might result
    in unexpected exposure of networks that\n   were previously unreachable.\n   There
    might be a small privacy improvement: with the current\n   practice, a multihomed
    host that sends packets with the wrong address\n   to an upstream router or network
    discloses the prefix of one upstream\n   to the other upstream network.  This
    practice reduces the probability\n   of that occurrence.\n"
