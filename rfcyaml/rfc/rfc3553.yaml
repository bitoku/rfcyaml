  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a new sub-delegation for the 'ietf' URN\n\
    \   namespace for registered protocol items.  The 'ietf' URN namespace is\n  \
    \ defined in RFC 2648 as a root for persistent URIs that refer to\n   IETF-defined\
    \ resources.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   From time to time IETF standards require the registration\
    \ of various\n   protocol elements in well known central repository.  The Internet\n\
    \   Assigned Numbers Authority maintains this central repository and\n   takes\
    \ direction from the IETF on what, how and when to add items to\n   it.  The IANA\
    \ maintains lists of items such as all assigned port\n   numbers, MIME media types,\
    \ enterprise numbers, etc.\n   Over time there has developed a need to be able\
    \ to reference these\n   elements as URIs in various schema.  In the past this\
    \ was done in a\n   very ad hoc way that easily led to interoperability problems.\
    \  This\n   document creates a new sub-delegation below the \"ietf\" [2]URN\n\
    \   namespace [1] called 'params' which acts as a standardized mechanism\n   for\
    \ naming the items registered for IETF standards.  Any assignments\n   below that\
    \ are specified in an RFC according to the IETF consensus\n   process and which\
    \ include the template found in Section 4.\n"

- title: 3.  IETF Sub-namespace Specifics
  contents:
  - "3.  IETF Sub-namespace Specifics\n   Sub-namespace name:\n      params\n   Declared\
    \ registrant of the namespace:\n      The Internet Engineering Task Force\n  \
    \ Declaration of structure:\n      The namespace is primarily opaque.  The IANA,\
    \ as operator of the\n      registry, may take suggestions for names to assign\
    \ but they\n      reserve the right to assign whatever name they desire, within\n\
    \      guidelines set by the IESG.  The colon character (\":\") is used to\n \
    \     denote a very limited concept of hierarchy.  If a colon is present\n   \
    \   then the items on both sides of it are valid names.  In general,\n      if\
    \ a name has a colon then the item on the left hand side\n      represents a class\
    \ of those items that would contain other items\n      of that class.  For example,\
    \ a name can be assigned to the entire\n      list of DNS resource record type\
    \ codes as well as for each\n      individual code.  The URN for the list might\
    \ look like this:\n            urn:ietf:params:dns:rr-type-codes\n      while\
    \ the URN for the SOA records type code might look like this:\n            urn:ietf:params:dns:rr-type-codes:soa\n\
    \   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      [3], [2], [1]\n   Identifier uniqueness\
    \ considerations:\n      The IESG uses the IETF consensus process to ensure that\n\
    \      sub-namespaces generate unique names within that\n      sub-namespace.\
    \  The IESG delegates to the IANA the task of\n      ensuring that the sub-namespace\
    \ names themselves are unique.\n      Until and unless the IESG specifies differently,\
    \ the IANA is\n      directed to ensure uniqueness by comparing the name to be\
    \ assigned\n      with the list of previously assigned names.  In the case of\
    \ a\n      conflict the IANA is to request a new string from the registrant\n\
    \      until the conflict is resolved.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n\
    \      Once a name has been allocated it MUST NOT be re-allocated for a\n    \
    \  different purpose.  The rules provided for assignments of values\n      within\
    \ a sub-namespace MUST be constructed so that the meaning of\n      values cannot\
    \ change.  This registration mechanism is not\n      appropriate for naming values\
    \ whose meaning may change over time.\n      If a value that changes over time\
    \ the assignment MUST name the\n      container or concept that contains the value,\
    \ not the value\n      itself.  For example, if a parameter called 'foo' has a\
    \ value that\n      changes over time, it is valid to create the name\n      'urn:ietf:params:foo-params:foo'\
    \ that identifies that 'slot'.  It\n      is not valid to actually create a name\
    \ that contains that value\n      unless it is a persistent and unique value such\
    \ as a version\n      number.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n      Identifiers\
    \ are assigned only after a particular protocol element\n      or number has been\
    \ registered with the IANA using standard\n      policies and procedures, or documented\
    \ in an RFC describing a\n      standards track protocol.  This means that the\
    \ 'gating' function\n      for assignment is the \"IETF Consensus\" process documented\
    \ in RFC\n      2434 [4].\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n      At this\
    \ time no resolution mechanism is defined.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n\
    \      Lexical equivalence is achieved by exact string match according to\n  \
    \    the rules for URN syntax found in RFC 2141 [1].  Specifically, due\n    \
    \  to the URN syntax definitions, the 'stringprep' standard found in\n      RFC\
    \ 3454 [7] does not apply.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      There are no\
    \ additional characters reserved.\n   Validation mechanism:\n      None.\n   Scope:\n\
    \      Global\n"
- title: 4.  Assigning Names
  contents:
  - "4.  Assigning Names\n   The creation of a new registry name will be simple for\
    \ most flat\n   registries.  The only required elements will be the registry name,\
    \ a\n   reference to relevant documents, a statement about which\n   current/proposed\
    \ document repositories contains the authoritative\n   data for the registry,\
    \ and a statement specifying which element in\n   the registry is the value to\
    \ be used in the URN.  In most cases this\n   last element will be the index value\
    \ assigned by the IANA.\n   More complex registries (DNS Parameters for example)\
    \ will need to\n   repeat that information for any sub-namespaces.  It should\
    \ also be\n   clear as to whether or not a name is assigned to the sub-namespace\n\
    \   itself (i.e., is 'urn:ietf:params:dns:rr-types' valid by itself and\n   if\
    \ so, what does it name?).\n   The template:\n   Registry name: -- The name of\
    \ the sub-namespace.  In many cases this\n      should be the same name that the\
    \ IANA calls the registry itself.\n   Specification: -- Relevant IETF published\
    \ documents that define the\n      registry and the items in it.\n   Repository:\
    \ -- A pointer to the 'current' location of the registry in\n      the protocol\
    \ parameters repository or the relevant RFCs that\n      document the items being\
    \ named.  This value will change over time\n      as the entity that maintains\
    \ the repository moves files and or\n      fileservers.  It is not meant as a\
    \ permanent binding to the\n      filename but as a hint to the IANA for what\
    \ the initial mapping\n      would be.\n   Index value: -- Description of how\
    \ a registered value is to be\n      embedded in the URI form.  This MUST include\
    \ details of any\n      transformations that may be needed for the resulting string\
    \ to\n      conform to URN syntax rules and any canonicalization needed so\n \
    \     that the case-sensitive string comparison yields the expected\n      equivalences.\n\
    \   The process for requesting that a URN be assigned is currently to put\n  \
    \ the above template or a reference to it in the IANA considerations\n   section\
    \ of the specifying document.  Other more automated processes\n   may be proposed\
    \ at a latter time if demand requires it.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   None not already inherent to using URNs.  Security\
    \ considerations for\n   URNs in general can be found in RFC 2141 [1].  Further\
    \ security\n   considerations for one specific URN resolution method can be found\
    \ in\n   Dynamic Delegation  Discovery System (DDDS) Part Four: The Uniform\n\
    \   Resource Identifiers (URI) Resolution Application (RFC 3404) [5]\n   which\
    \ is part of a series starting with Dynamic  Delegation Discovery\n   System (DDDS)\
    \ Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS  (RFC 3401) [6].\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This document puts a new and significant burden on\
    \ the IANA since it\n   may require an additional assignment process to happen\
    \ for each new\n   IANA registry.  To minimize the administrative burden on IANA,\
    \ any\n   parameter namespace registration is very clear about the criteria for\n\
    \   inclusion in that namespace.\n   Defining a registry that fits the constraints\
    \ of a URN namespace will\n   impose extra discipline that should take some of\
    \ the guess-work about\n   creating and maintaining that registry.\n"
