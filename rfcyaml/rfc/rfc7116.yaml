  - "1.  Introduction\n   The DTNRG Research Group has defined the Licklider Transmission\n\
    \   Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326].  LTP contains certain fields that are\n   subject\
    \ to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the\n   group has created\
    \ ad hoc registries.  As the specifications are\n   stable and have multiple interoperable\
    \ implementations, the group\n   would like to hand off the registries to IANA\
    \ for official\n   management.  This document describes the actions that IANA\
    \ needs to\n   take and uses the well-known IANA policy definitions as described\
    \ in\n   Section 4.1 of [RFC5226].\n   The Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE)\
    \ [RFC6260] specification\n   defines the concepts of 'Node Number' and 'Service\
    \ Number' in the\n   'ipn' URI scheme.  In this document, we request formation\
    \ of IANA\n   registries for these fields.\n   Because of its association with\
    \ space communication and the\n   Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems\
    \ [CCSDS], portions of\n   the \"CBHE Node Numbers\", \"CBHE Service Numbers\"\
    , and \"LTP Engine\n   Numbers\" spaces are delegated by this document to the\
    \ CCSDS Space\n   Assigned Numbers Authority [SANA].  SANA functions similarly\
    \ to IANA\n   in that it maintains registries of managed values, with a focus\
    \ on\n   values used by protocols used by CCSDS member agencies.\n   This document\
    \ represents the consensus of the DTNRG.  It has been\n   discussed and reviewed\
    \ by the research group and interested parties.\n"
