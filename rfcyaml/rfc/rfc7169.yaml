  - "Abstract\n   This document defines the NSA (No Secrecy Afforded) certificate\n\
    \   extension appropriate for use in certain PKIX (X.509 Pubic Key\n   Certificates)\
    \ digital certificates.  Historically, clients and\n   servers strived to maintain\
    \ the privacy of their keys; however, the\n   secrecy of their private keys cannot\
    \ always be maintained.  In\n   certain circumstances, a client or a server might\
    \ feel that they will\n   be compelled in the future to share their keys with\
    \ a third party.\n   Some clients and servers also have been compelled to share\
    \ their keys\n   and wish to indicate to relying parties upon certificate renewal\
    \ that\n   their keys have in fact been shared with a third party.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Insecurity abounds when clients and servers are unable to\
    \ keep their\n   private keys private.  Situations exist nonetheless where client\
    \ and\n   servers have shared their private keys with a third party.  An\n   example\
    \ of over-sharing might be lawful intercept.\n   Just because the private key\
    \ has been shared does not mean that the\n   private key holder wants to conceal\
    \ the fact they have shared their\n   private key with a third party.  Overtly\
    \ indicating that the private\n   key may be or has been shared with a third party\
    \ is the best way to\n   indicate to relying parties that this sharing has occurred.\n\
    \   Knowledge is power, after all.  Extensions for certificates [RFC5280]\n  \
    \ offer an excellent mechanism to indicate that the entities key(s)\n   have been\
    \ shared, and this document specifies one such certificate\n   extension for use\
    \ by entities that have shared their private key: the\n   NSA (No Secrecy Afforded)\
    \ certificate extension.\n"
- title: 2.  The NSA Certificate Extension
  contents:
  - "2.  The NSA Certificate Extension\n   In order to allow entities that have shared\
    \ their keys with a third\n   party, the NSA certificate extension is defined\
    \ herein.  ASN.1\n   [X.680] for the extension follows:\n   ext-KeyUsage EXTENSION\
    \ ::= { SYNTAX\n         BOOLEAN  IDENTIFIED BY id-pe-nsa }\n   id-pe-nsa OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER ::=  { id-pe 23 }\n   Making the boolean TRUE indicates that the\
    \ key has been shared with a\n   third party, and making the extension FALSE indicates\
    \ that the key\n   may have also been shared with a third party but the signer\
    \ does not\n   want to overtly indicate that the key has been shared.  This\n\
    \   extension is always marked critical.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Having to disclose keys is sometimes unavoidable.\
    \  Explicitly\n   indicating that the keys have been shared is one way to mitigate\
    \ the\n   risk that the relying party might be unaware of this over share.\n \
    \  Whatever the case for having shared the keys, the certificate signer\n   needs\
    \ to careful consider whether to include this extension.\n   Any key with this\
    \ extension must be trusted with care.  Lengthy\n   deliberations about whether\
    \ to trust the keys is necessary.  Rushing\n   a security analysis is never a\
    \ good thing.  Ultimately, the keys need\n   not be trusted.  Secrecy is hard.\n"
