  - "                          Comments on RFC #123\n        The requirement that\
    \ byte size 's' be 32-bits for\nthe initial connection imposes some severe strains\
    \ on some of\nthe 36-bit machines. For example, in our PDP-10 (DMCG-\nITS) NCP,\
    \ we have at present no way of sending or receiving\nexactly 32-bits of data.\
    \ Data is transmitted either in\nimage mode (36-bit bytes) or in ASCII mode (8-bit\
    \ characters\nwith the 8th bit as zero). Perhaps we should permit the\nserver\
    \ to send more than 32-bits (say 72-bits) where the\nremaining bits could be NULL\
    \ fillers. The byte size\n's' for the connection may be fixed at 8-bits.\n  [\
    \ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n  [ into the online\
    \ RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n  [ direction of Alex McKenzie.   \
