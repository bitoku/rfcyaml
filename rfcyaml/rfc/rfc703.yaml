  - "           July, 1975, Survey of New-Protocol TELNET Servers\nIn the nearly five\
    \ months since the last report several new server sites\nhave joined the network\
    \ and there has been some significant progress in\nNew-Protocol implementation.\
    \  Perhaps the New-Protocol implementation on\nthe TIPs scheduled for the end\
    \ of the year will encourage further\nprogress in the near future.\nThere have\
    \ been numerous changes since the last list (numbers in octal):\nSRI-ARC (2) is\
    \ no longer a server host;\nMIT-AI (206), MIT-ML (306), LONDON (52), and OFFICE-1\
    \ (53) have added\n    New-Protocol servers;\nLLL-RISOS (25), SDAC-44 (32), and\
    \ ARPA-DMS (34) have joined the network;\nSCI-TENEX (55), Rutgers-10 (56), USC-ISIC\
    \ (364), and SUMEX-AIM (70) have\n    joined the network with New-Protocol servers.\n\
    The following is the latest version* of the summary and tabulation of\nserver-host\
    \ TELNET servers.\n        total server hosts             43      100%\n     \

    \ via a surveying program run at\n    various times, plus a few manual checks\
    \ to fill out the list.  What\n    is reported here is the way the various servers\
    \ work as seen by the\n    new-Protocol User Telnet at BBNA, as of 10 July 1975.\n\
    (2) These are the sites whose operation is 100% correct according to all\n   \
    \ protocols and conventions, as I understand them.\n(3) We realize that some of\
    \ the servers that appear here as New-Protocol\n    servers on socket 1 are actually\
    \ servers which attempt to\n    communicate with both Old- and New-Protocol User\
    \ TELNETs according\n    to what control sequences are received.\n           Tabulation\
