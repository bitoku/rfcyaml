  - "Abstract\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework\n\
    \   for passing configuration information to hosts on a Transmission\n   Control\
    \ Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network.  Configuration\n   parameters and\
    \ other control information are carried in tagged data\n   items that are stored\
    \ in the 'options' field of the DHCP message.\n   The data items themselves are\
    \ also called \"options\".\n   DHCP protocol messages are identified by the 'DHCP\
    \ Message Type'\n   option (option code 51).  Each message type is defined by\
    \ the data\n   value carried in the 'DHCP Message Type' option.\n   New DHCP options\
    \ and message types may be defined after the\n   publication of the DHCP specification\
    \ to accommodate requirements for\n   conveyance of new configuration parameters\
    \ or to accommodate new\n   protocol semantics.  This document describes the procedure\
    \ for\n   defining new DHCP options and message types.\n"

  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [1] provides\
    \ a\n   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP\n\
    \   network.  Configuration parameters and other control information are\n   carried\
    \ in tagged data items that are stored in the 'options' field\n   of the DHCP\
    \ message.  The data items themselves are also called\n   \"options\" [2].\n \
    \  DHCP protocol messages are identified by the 'DHCP Message Type'\n   option\
    \ (option code 51).  Each message type is defined by the data\n   value carried\
    \ in the 'DHCP Message Type' option.\n   This document describes the procedure\
    \ for defining new DHCP options\n   and message types.  The procedure will guarantee\
    \ that:\n   * allocation of new option numbers and message type numbers is\n \
    \    coordinated from a single authority,\n   * new options and message types\
    \ are reviewed for technical\n     correctness and appropriateness, and\n   *\
    \ documentation for new options and message types is complete and\n     published.\n\
    \   As indicated in, \"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations\n   Section\
    \ in RFCs\", (see references), IANA acts as a central authority\n   for assignment\
    \ of numbers such as DHCP option and message type codes.\n   The new procedure\
    \ outlined in this document will provide guidance to\n   IANA in the assignment\
    \ of new option and message type codes.\n   This document updates and replaces\
    \ RFC 2489.\n"

  contents:
  - "2. Overview and background\n   This document specifies procedures for defining\
    \ new option codes and\n   message types.\n"
- title: 2.1 New DHCP option codes
  contents:
  - "2.1 New DHCP option codes\n   The procedure described in this document modifies\
    \ and clarifies the\n   procedure for defining new options in RFC 2131 [2].  The\
    \ primary\n   modification is to the time at which a new DHCP option is assigned\
    \ an\n   option number.  In the procedure described in this document, the\n  \
    \ option number is not assigned until specification for the option is\n   about\
    \ to be published as an RFC.\n   Since the publication of RFC 2132, the option\
    \ number space for\n   publicly defined DHCP options (1-127) has almost been exhausted.\n\
    \   Many of the defined option numbers have not been followed up with\n   Internet\
    \ Drafts submitted to the DHC WG.  There has been a lack of\n   specific guidance\
    \ to IANA from the DHC WG as to the assignment of\n   DHCP option numbers.\n \
    \  The procedure as specified in RFC 2132 does not clearly state that\n   new\
    \ options are to be reviewed individually for technical\n   correctness, appropriateness\
    \ and complete documentation.  RFC 2132\n   also does not require that new options\
    \ are to be submitted to the\n   IESG for review, and that the author of the option\
    \ specification is\n   responsible for bringing new options to the attention of\
    \ the IESG.\n   Finally, RFC 2132 does not make clear that newly defined options\
    \ are\n   not to be incorporated into products, included in other\n   specifications\
    \ or otherwise used until the specification for the\n   option is published as\
    \ an RFC.\n   In the future, new DHCP option codes will be assigned by IETF\n\
    \   consensus.  New DHCP options will be documented in RFCs approved by\n   the\
    \ IESG, and the codes for those options will be assigned at the\n   time the relevant\
    \ RFCs are published.  Typically, the IESG will seek\n   input on prospective\
    \ assignments from appropriate sources (e.g., a\n   relevant Working Group if\
    \ one exists).  Groups of related options may\n   be combined  into a single specification\
    \ and reviewed as a set by the\n   IESG.  Prior to assignment of an option code,\
    \ it is not appropriate\n   to incorporate new options into products, include\
    \ the specification\n   in other documents or otherwise make use of the new options.\n\
    \   The DHCP option number space (1-254) is split into two parts.  The\n   site-specific\
    \ option codes [2] (128-254) are defined as \"Private Use\"\n   and require no\
    \ review by the DHC WG.  Site-specific options codes\n   (128-254) MUST NOT be\
    \ defined for use by any publicly distributed\n   DHCP server, client or relay\
    \ agent implementations.  These option\n   codes are explicitly reserved for private\
    \ definition and use within a\n   site or an organization.\n   The public option\
    \ codes (0-127, 255) are defined as \"Specification\n   Required\" and new options\
    \ must be reviewed prior to assignment of an\n   option number by IANA.  The details\
    \ of the review process are given\n   in the following section of this document.\n"
- title: 2.2 New DHCP message types
  contents:
  - "2.2 New DHCP message types\n   RFC 2131 does not specify any mechanism for defining\
    \ new DHCP message\n   types.  In the future, new DHCP message types will be documented\
    \ in\n   RFCs approved by the IESG, and the codes for these new message types\n\
    \   will be assigned at the time the relevant RFCs are published.\n   Typically,\
    \ the IESG will seek input on new message types from\n   appropriate sources (e.g.,\
    \ a relevant Working Group if one exists).\n   Prior to assignment of a message\
    \ type code, it is not appropriate to\n   incorporate new message types into products,\
    \ include the\n   specification in other documents or otherwise make use of the\
    \ new\n   message types.\n"
- title: 3. Procedure
  contents:
  - "3. Procedure\n   The author of a new DHCP option or message type will follow\
    \ these\n   steps to obtain approval for the option and publication of the\n \
    \  specification of the option as an RFC:\n   1. The author devises the new option\
    \ or message type.\n   2. The author documents the new option or message type,\
    \ leaving the\n      option code or message type code as \"To Be Determined\"\
    \ (TBD), as\n      an Internet Draft.\n      The requirement that the new option\
    \ or message type be documented\n      as an Internet Draft is a matter of expediency.\
    \  In theory, the\n      new option or message type could be documented on the\
    \ back of an\n      envelope for submission; as a practical matter, the specification\n\
    \      will eventually become an Internet Draft as part of the review\n      process.\n\
    \   3. The author submits the Internet Draft for review by the IESG.\n      Preferably,\
    \ the author will submit the Internet Draft to the DHC\n      Working Group, but\
    \ the author may choose to submit the Internet\n      Draft directly to the IESG.\n\
    \      Note that simply publishing the new option or message type as an\n    \
    \  Internet Draft does not automatically bring the option to the\n      attention\
    \ of the IESG.  The author of the new option or message\n      type must explicitly\
    \ forward a request for action on the new\n      option to the DHC WG or the IESG.\n\
    \   4. The specification of the new option or message type is reviewed by\n  \
    \    the IESG.  The specification is reviewed by the DHC WG (if it\n      exists)\
    \ or by the IETF.  If the option or message type is accepted\n      for inclusion\
    \ in the DHCP specification, the specification of the\n      option or message\
    \ type is published as an RFC.  It may be\n      published as either a standards-track\
    \ or a non-standards-track\n      RFC.\n   5. At the time of publication as an\
    \ RFC, IANA assigns a DHCP option\n      code or message type code to the new\
    \ option or message type.\n"

- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   Information that creates or updates an option\
    \ code or message type\n   code assignment needs to be authenticated.\n   An analysis\
    \ of security issues is required for all newly defined DHCP\n   options or message\
    \ types.  The description of security issues in the\n   specification of new options\
    \ or message types must be as accurate as\n   possible.  The specification for\
    \ a new option or message type may\n   reference the \"Security Considerations\"\
    \ section in the DHCP\n   specification [1]; e.g., (from \"NetWare/IP Domain Name\
    \ and\n   Information\" [3]):\n      DHCP currently provides no authentication\
    \ or security mechanisms.\n      Potential exposures to attack are discussed in\
    \ section 7 of the\n      DHCP protocol specification [RFC 2131].\n"

    \   instructions.  In particular, IANA is requested to assign DHCP option\n  \
    \ codes or message type codes only for options or message types that\n   have\
    \ been approved for publication as RFCs; i.e., documents that have\n   been approved\
    \ through \"IETF consensus\" as defined in RFC 2434 [4].\n"
