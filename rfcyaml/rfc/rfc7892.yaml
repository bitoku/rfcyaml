  - "1.  Introduction\n   IANA maintains \"OTN Signal Type\" subregistry of the \"Generalized\n
    \  Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters\" registry\n   for
    OTN signal types (as defined in [RFC4328] and updated by\n   [RFC7139]).  This
    subregistry is defined to use only the Standards\n   Action registration policy
    as defined by [RFC5226].  This document\n   updates [RFC7139] to allow the \"OTN
    Signal Type\" subregistry to also\n   use the Specification Required policy as
    defined in [RFC5226].\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce any new security
    considerations to\n   the existing GMPLS signaling protocols.  Refer to [RFC7139]
    for\n   further details of the specific security measures.  Additionally,\n   [RFC5920]
    provides an overview of security vulnerabilities and\n   protection mechanisms
    for the GMPLS control plane.\n"

  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA maintains the \"OTN Signal Type\" subregistry
    of the \"Generalized\n   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters\"\n
    \  registry.  The registry currently is defined to use the Standards\n   Action
    registration policy as defined by [RFC5226].\n   Per this document, IANA has updated
    the registration policies for the\n   \"OTN Signal Type\" subregistry to be \"Standards
    Action\" for Standards\n   Track documents and \"Specification Required\" for
    other documents.\n"
