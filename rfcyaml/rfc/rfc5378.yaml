  - "1.  Definitions\n   The following definitions are for terms used in the context\
    \ of this\n   document.  Other terms, including \"IESG\", \"ISOC\", \"IAB\", and\
    \ \"RFC\n   Editor\" are defined in [RFC2028].\n   a. \"Contribution\": any submission\
    \ to the IETF intended by the\n      Contributor for publication as all or part\
    \ of an Internet-Draft or\n      RFC (except for RFC Editor Contributions described\
    \ in Section 4\n      below) and any statement made within the context of an IETF\n\
    \      activity.  Such statements include oral statements in IETF\n      sessions\
    \ as well as written and electronic communications, made at\n      any time or\
    \ place, that are addressed to:\n      o the IETF plenary session,\n      o any\
    \ IETF working group or portion thereof,\n      o any Birds of a Feather (BOF)\
    \ session,\n      o the IESG, or any member thereof on behalf of the IESG,\n \
    \     o the IAB, or any member thereof on behalf of the IAB,\n      o any IETF\
    \ mailing list, including the IETF list itself, any\n        working group or\
    \ design team list, or any other list functioning\n        under IETF auspices,\n\
    \      o the RFC Editor or the Internet-Drafts function (except for RFC\n    \
    \    Editor Contributions, as described in Section 4 below).\n      Statements\
    \ made outside of an IETF session, mailing list, or other\n      function, that\
    \ are clearly not intended to be input to an IETF\n      activity, group, or function\
    \ are not IETF Contributions in the\n      context of this document.\n   b. \"\
    Contributor\": an individual submitting a Contribution.\n   c. \"Indirect Contributor\"\
    : any person who has materially or\n      substantially contributed to a Contribution\
    \ without being\n      personally involved in its submission to the IETF.\n  \
    \ d. \"Copyright\": the legal right granted to an author in a document or\n  \
    \    other work of authorship under applicable law.  A \"copyright\" is\n    \
    \  not equivalent to a \"right to copy\".  Rather a copyright\n      encompasses\
    \ all of the exclusive rights that an author has in a\n      work, such as the\
    \ rights to copy, publish, distribute and create\n      derivative works of the\
    \ work.  An author often cedes these rights\n      to his or her employer or other\
    \ parties as a condition of\n      employment or compensation.\n   e. \"IETF\"\
    : in the context of this document, the IETF includes all\n      individuals who\
    \ participate in meetings, working groups, mailing\n      lists, functions, and\
    \ other activities that are organized or\n      initiated by ISOC, the IESG, or\
    \ the IAB under the general\n      designation of the Internet Engineering Task\
    \ Force (IETF), but\n      solely to the extent of such participation.\n   f.\
    \ \"IETF Documents\": RFCs and Internet-Drafts that are used in the\n      IETF\
    \ Standards Process as defined in 1(g).  This is identical to\n      the \"IETF\
    \ stream\" defined in [RFC4844].\n   g. \"IETF Standards Process\": the activities\
    \ undertaken by the IETF in\n      any of the settings described in 1(a) above.\n\
    \   h. \"IETF Trust\": a trust established under the laws of the\n      Commonwealth\
    \ of Virginia, USA, in order to hold and administer\n      intellectual property\
    \ rights for the benefit of the IETF.\n   i. \"Internet-Draft\": temporary documents\
    \ used in the IETF Standards\n      Process.  Internet-Drafts are posted on the\
    \ IETF web site by the\n      IETF Secretariat.  As noted in Section 2.2 of RFC\
    \ 2026, Internet-\n      Drafts have a nominal maximum lifetime of six months\
    \ in the IETF\n      Secretariat's public directory.\n   j. \"Legend Instructions\"\
    : the standardized text that is maintained by\n      the IETF Trust and is included\
    \ in IETF Documents and the\n      instructions and requirements for including\
    \ that standardized text\n      in IETF Documents.  The text and instructions\
    \ are posted from time\n      to time at http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info.\n\
    \   k. \"RFC\": the publication series used by the IETF among others.  RFCs\n\
    \      are published by the RFC Editor.  Although RFCs may be superseded\n   \
    \   in whole or in part by subsequent RFCs, the text of an RFC is not\n      altered\
    \ once published in RFC form.  (See [RFC2026] Section 2.1.)\n   l. \"Reasonably\
    \ and personally known\": something an individual knows\n      personally or,\
    \ because of the job the individual holds, would\n      reasonably be expected\
    \ to know.  This wording is used to indicate\n      that an organization cannot\
    \ purposely keep an individual in the\n      dark about certain information just\
    \ to avoid the disclosure\n      requirement.\n   m. \"Non-IETF documents\": Internet-Drafts\
    \ that are submitted to the\n      RFC Editor independently of the IETF Standards\
    \ Process.  (See\n      Section 4.)\n"
- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   In all matters of copyright and document procedures, the\
    \ intent is to\n   benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while\n\
    \   respecting the legitimate rights of others.\n   Under the laws of most countries\
    \ and current international treaties\n   (for example the \"Berne Convention for\
    \ the Protection of Literary and\n   Artistic Work\" [Berne]), authors obtain\
    \ numerous rights in the works\n   they produce automatically upon producing them.\
    \  These rights include\n   copyrights, moral rights, and other rights.  In many\
    \ cases, if the\n   author produces a work within the scope of his or her employment,\n\
    \   most of those rights are usually assigned to the employer, either by\n   operation\
    \ of law or, in many cases, under contract.  (The Berne\n   Convention names some\
    \ rights as \"inalienable\", which means that the\n   author retains them in all\
    \ cases.)\n   In order for Contributions to be used within the IETF Standards\n\
    \   Process, including when they are published as Internet-Drafts or\n   RFCs,\
    \ certain limited rights must be granted to the IETF Trust, which\n   then grants\
    \ the necessary rights to the IETF.  In addition,\n   Contributors must make representations\
    \ to the IETF Trust and the IETF\n   regarding their ability to grant these rights.\n\
    \   Section 1 provides definitions used in these policies.  Sections 3\n   and\
    \ 4 of this document explain the rationale for these provisions.\n   Sections\
    \ 1, 2, 5, and 6 of this document are normative, the other\n   sections are informative.\
    \  RFC 3979 (BCP 79) [RFC3979] deals with\n   rights, including possible patent\
    \ rights, in technologies developed\n   or specified as part of the IETF Standards\
    \ Process.  This document is\n   not intended to address those issues.  This memo\
    \ obsoletes RFCs 3978\n   [RFC3978] and 4748 [RFC4748] and, with RFC 3979 (BCP\
    \ 79) and\n   [RFC5377], replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026 [RFC2026].\n   This document\
    \ is not intended as legal advice.  Readers are advised\n   to consult their own\
    \ legal advisors if they would like a legal\n   interpretation of their rights\
    \ or the rights of the IETF Trust\n   [RFC4371] in any Contributions they make.\n"

  - "2.1.  No Retroactive Effect\n   This memo does not retroactively obtain additional\
    \ rights from\n   Contributions that predate the date that the IETF Trust announces\
    \ the\n   adoption of these procedures.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Rights Granted in Contributions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Rights Granted in Contributions\n   The IETF Trust and the IETF must obtain\
    \ the right to publish an IETF\n   Contribution as an RFC or an Internet-Draft\
    \ from the Contributors.\n   A primary objective of this policy is to obtain from\
    \ the document\n   authors only the non-exclusive rights that are needed to develop\
    \ and\n   publish IETF Documents and to use IETF Contributions in the IETF\n \
    \  Standards Process and potentially elsewhere.\n   The authors retain all other\
    \ rights, but cannot withdraw the above\n   rights from the IETF Trust and the\
    \ IETF.\n   It is important to note that under this document, Contributors are\n\
    \   required to grant certain rights to the IETF Trust (see Section\n   5.3.),\
    \ which holds all IETF-related intellectual property on behalf\n   of the IETF\
    \ community.  The IETF Trust will, in turn, grant a\n   sublicense of these rights\
    \ to all IETF participants for use in the\n   IETF Standards Process (see Section\
    \ 5.4.).  This sublicense is\n   necessary for the standards development work\
    \ of the IETF to continue.\n   In addition, the IETF Trust may grant certain other\
    \ sublicenses of\n   the rights that it is granted under this document.  In granting\
    \ such\n   other sublicenses, the IETF Trust will be guided and bound by\n   documents\
    \ such as [RFC5377].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Rights to Use Contributions
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Rights to Use Contributions\n   It is important that the IETF receive assurances\
    \ from all\n   Contributors that they have the authority to grant the IETF the\n\
    \   rights that they claim to grant because, under the laws of most\n   countries\
    \ and applicable international treaties, copyright rights\n   come into existence\
    \ when a work of authorship is created (but see\n   Section 3.5 below regarding\
    \ public domain documents), and the IETF\n   cannot make use of IETF Contributions\
    \ if it does not have sufficient\n   rights with respect to these copyright rights.\
    \  The IETF and its\n   participants would run a greater risk of liability to\
    \ the owners of\n   these rights without this assurance.  To this end, the IETF\
    \ asks\n   Contributors to give the assurances in Section 5.6 below.  These\n\
    \   assurances are requested, however, only to the extent of the\n   Contributor's\
    \ reasonable and personal knowledge.  (See Section 1(l).)\n"
- title: 3.3.  Right to Produce Derivative Works
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Right to Produce Derivative Works\n   The IETF needs to be able to evolve\
    \ IETF Documents in response to\n   experience gained in the deployment of the\
    \ technologies described in\n   such IETF Documents, to incorporate developments\
    \ in research, and to\n   react to changing conditions on the Internet and other\
    \ IP networks.\n   The IETF may also decide to permit others to develop derivative\
    \ works\n   based on Contributions.  In order to do this, the IETF must be able\n\
    \   to produce derivatives of its documents; thus, the IETF must obtain\n   the\
    \ right from Contributors to produce derivative works.  Note that\n   the right\
    \ to produce translations is required before any Contribution\n   can be published\
    \ as an RFC, to ensure the widest possible\n   distribution of the material in\
    \ RFCs.  The right to produce\n   derivative works, in addition to translations,\
    \ is required for all\n   IETF Standards Track documents and for most IETF non-Standards\
    \ Track\n   documents.  There are two exceptions to this requirement: documents\n\
    \   describing proprietary technologies and documents that are\n   republications\
    \ of the work of other standards organizations.\n   The right to produce derivative\
    \ works must be granted in order for an\n   IETF working group to accept a Contribution\
    \ as a working group\n   document or otherwise work on it.  For non-working group\n\
    \   Contributions where the Contributor requests publication as a\n   Standards\
    \ Track RFC, the right to produce derivative works must be\n   granted before\
    \ the IESG will issue an IETF Last Call and, for most\n   non-Standards Track,\
    \ non-working group Contributions, before the IESG\n   will consider the Internet-Draft\
    \ for publication.  Occasionally a\n   Contributor may not want to grant publication\
    \ rights or the right to\n   produce derivative works before finding out if a\
    \ Contribution has\n   been accepted for development in the IETF Standards Process.\
    \  In\n   these cases, the Contributor may include a limitation on the right to\n\
    \   make derivative works in the form specified in the Legend\n   Instructions.\
    \  A working group can discuss the Contribution with the\n   aim to decide if\
    \ it should become a working group document, even\n   though the right to produce\
    \ derivative works or to publish the\n   Contribution as an RFC has not yet been\
    \ granted.  However, if the\n   Contribution is accepted for development, the\
    \ Contributor must\n   resubmit the Contribution without the limitation notices\
    \ before a\n   working group can formally adopt the Contribution as a working\
    \ group\n   document.  The IETF Trust may establish different policies for\n \
    \  granting sublicenses with respect to different types of Contributions\n   and\
    \ content within Contributions (such as executable code versus\n   descriptive\
    \ text or references to third-party materials).  The IETF\n   Trust's policies\
    \ concerning the granting of sublicenses to make\n   derivative works will be\
    \ guided by RFC [RFC5377].\n   The IETF has historically encouraged organizations\
    \ to publish details\n   of their technologies, even when the technologies are\
    \ proprietary,\n   because understanding how existing technology is being used\
    \ helps\n   when developing new technology.  But organizations that publish\n\
    \   information about proprietary technologies are frequently not willing\n  \
    \ to have the IETF produce revisions of the technologies and then\n   possibly\
    \ claim that the IETF version is the \"new version\" of the\n   organization's\
    \ technology.  Organizations that feel this way can\n   specify that a Contribution\
    \ be published with the other rights\n   granted under this document but may withhold\
    \ the right to produce\n   derivative works other than translations.\n   In addition,\
    \ IETF Documents frequently make normative references to\n   standards or recommendations\
    \ developed by other standards\n   organizations.  Since the publications of some\
    \ standards\n   organizations are not public documents, it can be quite helpful\
    \ to\n   the IETF to republish, with the permission of the other standards\n \
    \  organization, some of these documents as RFCs so that the IETF\n   community\
    \ can have open access to them to better understand what they\n   are referring\
    \ to.  In these cases, the RFCs can be published without\n   the right for the\
    \ IETF to produce derivative works.  In both of the\n   above cases, in which\
    \ the production of derivative works is excluded,\n   the Contributor must include\
    \ a special legend in the Contribution, as\n   specified in the Legend Instructions,\
    \ in order to notify IETF\n   participants about this restriction.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Rights to Use Trademarks
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Rights to Use Trademarks\n   Contributors may wish to seek trademark or\
    \ service mark protection on\n   any terms that are coined or used in their Contributions.\
    \  The IETF\n   makes no judgment about the validity of any such trademark rights.\n\
    \   However, the IETF requires each Contributor, under the licenses\n   described\
    \ in Section 5.3 below, to grant the IETF Trust a perpetual\n   license to use\
    \ any such trademarks or service marks solely in\n   exercising rights to reproduce,\
    \ publish, discuss, and modify the IETF\n   Contribution.  This license does not\
    \ authorize the IETF or others to\n   use any trademark or service mark in connection\
    \ with any product or\n   service offering.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Contributions Not Subject to Copyright
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Contributions Not Subject to Copyright\n   Certain documents, including\
    \ those produced by the U.S. government\n   and those which are in the public\
    \ domain, may not be protected by the\n   same copyright and other legal rights\
    \ as other documents.\n   Nevertheless, we ask each Contributor to grant to the\
    \ IETF the same\n   rights he or she would grant, and to make the same representations,\n\
    \   as though the IETF Contribution were protected by the same legal\n   rights\
    \ as other documents, and as though the Contributor could be\n   able to grant\
    \ these rights.  We ask for these grants and\n   representations only to the extent\
    \ that the Contribution may be\n   protected.  We believe they are necessary to\
    \ protect the ISOC, the\n   IETF Trust, the IETF, the IETF Standards Process,\
    \ and all IETF\n   participants, and because the IETF does not have the resources\
    \ or\n   wherewithal to make any independent investigation as to the actual\n\
    \   proprietary status of any document submitted to it.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Copyright in RFCs
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Copyright in RFCs\n   As noted above, Contributors to the IETF (or their\
    \ employers) retain\n   ownership of the copyright in their Contributions.  This\
    \ includes\n   Internet-Drafts and all other Contributions made within the IETF\n\
    \   Standards Process (e.g., via e-mail, oral comment, and otherwise).\n   However,\
    \ it is important that the IETF (through the IETF Trust) own\n   the copyright\
    \ in documents that are published as RFCs (other than\n   Informational RFCs and\
    \ RFCs that are submitted as RFC Editor\n   Contributions).  Ownership of the\
    \ copyright in an RFC does not\n   diminish the Contributors' rights in their\
    \ underlying contributions,\n   but it does prevent anyone other than the IETF\
    \ Trust (and its\n   licensees) from republishing or modifying an RFC in RFC format.\
    \  In\n   this respect, Contributors are treated the same as anybody else:\n \
    \  though they may extract and republish their own Contributions without\n   limitation,\
    \ they may not do so in the RFC format used by the IETF.\n   And while this principle\
    \ (which is included in Section 5.9 below) may\n   appear to be new to the IETF,\
    \ it actually reflects historical\n   practice and has been observed for many\
    \ years through the inclusion\n   of an ISOC or IETF Trust copyright notice on\
    \ all RFC documents since\n   the publication of RFC 2026.\n"

  contents:
  - "10.  Changes since RFC 3978\n   This document represents a significant reorganization\
    \ and rewording\n   of RFC 3978, along with a number of substantive changes.\n\
    \   The most basic change is to limit this document to the rights that a\n   Contributor\
    \ grants to the IETF Trust when making a Contribution.  All\n   sublicenses of\
    \ rights for the use of IETF Documents must be provided\n   by the IETF Trust.\
    \  (See Section 5.4.)\n   Material added from RFC 4748 that recognized the IETF\
    \ Trust.\n   Most of the material relating to RFC Editor documents has been\n\
    \   removed since the RFC Editor maintains their own rules and processes\n   for\
    \ RFC Editor documents.  Renamed these documents to \"non-IETF\n   documents\"\
    .  Added section 11 from the IAB discussing this topic.\n   Changes in the definitions\
    \ section include defining the terms\n   \"Contribution\", \"Indirect Contributor\"\
    , \"Copyright\", \"IETF Trust\",\n   and \"Legend Instructions\", as well as minor\
    \ tweaks to some of the\n   other definitions.\n   The responsibility for the\
    \ text of notices has been given to the IETF\n   Trust and removed from this document.\
    \  (See Section 6.)\n   Clarified that Contributors enter into a legally binding\
    \ contract\n   when they submit a Contribution.  (See Section 5.1.)\n   The right\
    \ to produce derivative works provided by the Contributor to\n   the IETF Trust\
    \ is not limited to being within the IETF Standards\n   Process.\n   Made it clear\
    \ that this document does not deal with patent licenses.\n   (See Section 5.5.)\n\
    \   Clarified the ownership of the Copyrights to IETF Documents.  (See\n   Section\
    \ 5.9.)\n   Clarified the rights retained by authors of IETF Contributions.  (See\n\
    \   Section 5.10.)\n"

    \ stream\n   documents' IPR are then automatically covered by the outbound rights\n\
    \   that the IETF Trust will establish based on the advice in [RFC5377].\n   We\
    \ also want to stress that, for any change in the inbound rights for\n   streams\
    \ other than the IETF and IAB streams, there needs to be a\n   stream-dependent\
    \ discussion and approval process, as indicated in RFC\n   4844, \"The RFC Series\
    \ and RFC Editor\" [RFC4844], section 4.2.3.\n   To that extent, section 4 of\
