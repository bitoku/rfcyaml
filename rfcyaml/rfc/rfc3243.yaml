- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The goal of the Robust Header Compression (ROHC) Working\
    \ Group is to\n   develop header compression schemes that perform well over links\
    \ with\n   high error rates and long link roundtrip times.  The schemes must\n\
    \   perform well for cellular links, using technologies such as WCDMA,\n   EDGE,\
    \ and CDMA-2000.  However, the schemes should also be applicable\n   to other\
    \ future link technologies with high loss and long roundtrip\n   times.\n   ROHC\
    \ RTP has become a very efficient, robust and capable compression\n   scheme,\
    \ able to compress the IP/UDP/RTP headers down to a total size\n   of only one\
    \ octet.  This makes ROHC RTP an excellent solution for\n   future cellular environments\
    \ with new air interfaces, such as WCDMA,\n   making even speech services possible\
    \ over IP with an insignificantly\n   lower spectrum efficiency compared to existing\
    \ circuit switched\n   solutions.\n   However, all-IP cellular networks will also\
    \ be built with already\n   existing air interfaces such as GSM and IS-95, which\
    \ are less\n   flexible using radio bearers optimized for specific frame sizes\n\
    \   matching the speech codecs used.  This means that not a single octet\n   of\
    \ header can be added without switching to the next higher fixed\n   packet size\
    \ supported by the link, something which is obviously very\n   costly.  In the\
    \ long term, this drawback should of course be\n   eliminated with new, more flexible\
    \ air interfaces, but in the short\n   term it would be desirable if an efficiency\
    \ comparable to the circuit\n   switched case could also be achieved for already\
    \ deployed speech\n   codecs when used over the existing air interfaces.  To achieve\
    \ that,\n   it must be possible to completely eliminate the headers for a\n  \
    \ majority of the packets during normal operation, and this is the\n   purpose\
    \ of 0-byte header compression.  All functionality normally\n   provided by the\
    \ 1-octet header must then be provided by some other\n   means, typically by utilizing\
    \ functionality from the lower layer.  It\n   is important to remember that the\
    \ purpose of 0-byte header\n   compression is to provide optimal efficiency for\
    \ applications\n   matching the link layer characteristics, not efficiency in\
    \ general.\n   As a starting point for these requirements, the well-established\n\
    \   requirements base developed in the ROHC WG has been used.  From that,\n  \
    \ the requirements have evolved through input from the 3GPP2 community\n   and\
    \ from discussions within the WG.\n"
- title: 2.  Assumptions for the Applicability of 0-byte RTP Header Compression
  contents:
  - "2.  Assumptions for the Applicability of 0-byte RTP Header Compression\n   The\
    \ purpose of 0-byte header compression is to provide optimal usage\n   of certain\
    \ links when the traffic pattern of a packet stream\n   completely matches the\
    \ characteristics of that link.  There are no\n   assumptions that only packet\
    \ streams complying with that pattern will\n   occur, but optimal efficiency cannot\
    \ of course be provided when this\n   is not the case.\n   To make 0-byte header\
    \ compression feasible, it is assumed that lower\n   layers can provide the necessary\
    \ functionality needed to replace the\n   1-octet headers and fulfill the requirements\
    \ defined in section 3.\n   An example is the synchronized nature of most cellular\
    \ links, which\n   can provide sequencing and timing information and make packet\
    \ loss\n   detection possible.\n"
- title: 3.  Requirements on 0-byte RTP Header Compression
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements on 0-byte RTP Header Compression\n   Since 0-byte header compression\
    \ for ROHC IP/UDP/RTP is a variant of\n   regular ROHC RTP compression [ROHC],\
    \ these requirements are described\n   as deltas to those defined in the regular\
    \ RTP requirements [RTP-REQ].\n   For simplicity, this section is also separated\
    \ into the same three\n   subsections as the requirements in [RTP-REQ], where\
    \ the first deals\n   with the impact of header compression on the rest of the\
    \ Internet\n   infrastructure, the second concerns the headers to be compressed,\
    \ and\n   the third covers efficiency and link technology related issues.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Impact on Internet Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Impact on Internet Infrastructure\n   The meaning of header compression\
    \ is in no way changed by the\n   introduction of 0-byte header compression. \
    \ No additional impact on\n   the Internet infrastructure is thus allowed.  The\
    \ \"Transparency\" and\n   \"Ubiquity\" requirements of [RTP-REQ, section 2.1]\
    \ therefore also\n   apply to 0-byte RTP compression without any modifications.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Supported Headers and Kinds of RTP Streams
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Supported Headers and Kinds of RTP Streams\n   The 0-byte RTP compression\
    \ scheme in general imposes the same\n   requirements on supported headers and\
    \ RTP streams as regular ROHC RTP\n   [RTP-REQ, section 2.2].  However, there\
    \ are some aspects regarding\n   the \"Genericity\" and IPSEC requirements that\
    \ should be noted.\n   The \"Genericity\" requirement of [RTP-REQ] states that\
    \ compression of\n   headers of arbitrary RTP streams must be supported, and this\
    \ is also\n   true for the 0-byte compression scheme to the extent that it is\
    \ not\n   allowed to assume certain RTP behavior.  However, as also stated in\n\
    \   [RTP-REQ], this does not preclude optimizations for certain media\n   types\
    \ where the traffic pattern is known.  For 0-byte RTP, this means\n   that the\
    \ scheme must be able to handle arbitrary RTP streams in order\n   to fulfill\
    \ the requirements of section 3.1.  However, due to the\n   typical characteristics\
    \ of 0-byte compression, by requiring a traffic\n   pattern that suits the link\
    \ over which it is implemented to be able\n   to compress down to 0-byte headers,\
    \ it becomes optimized for\n   applications with link-suited traffic patterns.\
    \  For traffic that\n   does not comply with the link properties, the scheme must\n\
    \   automatically and immediately fall back to non-0-byte RTP compression\n  \
    \ and must not have any impact on the packet stream.\n   Regarding IPSEC, it should\
    \ be noted that 0-byte compression cannot be\n   achieved if parts of the original\
    \ headers are encrypted or carry\n   randomly changing fields.  IPSEC and 0-byte\
    \ RTP header compression\n   therefore do not go well together.  If IPSEC is used\
    \ and prevents 0-\n   byte compression, the scheme must fall back to a less efficient\n\
    \   compression that can handle all present header fields.  Of course,\n   this\
    \ applies not only to IPSEC but to all cases where headers cannot\n   be compressed\
    \ down to 0-byte.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Performance Issues
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Performance Issues\n   All the performance requirements of [RTP-REQ] also\
    \ apply to 0-byte\n   RTP header compression, with the following additions and\
    \ exceptions:\n   -  Performance/Spectral Efficiency: For packet streams with\
    \ traffic\n      patterns that match the characteristics of the link over which\
    \ 0-\n      byte header compression is implemented, the performance should be\n\
    \      such that 0-byte header packets are generated during normal\n      operation,\
    \ most of the time.  0-byte headers would then replace\n      most of the 1-octet\
    \ headers used by regular ROHC RTP [ROHC].\n      Justification: Spectrum efficiency\
    \ is a primary goal.  Studies\n      have shown that for certain applications\
    \ and link technologies,\n      even a single octet of header may result in a\
    \ significant decrease\n      in spectrum efficiency, compared to existing circuit\
    \ switched\n      solutions.\n   -  Header Compression Coexistence: The scheme\
    \ must fit into the ROHC\n      framework together with other ROHC profiles.\n\
    \      Justification: Implementation simplicity is an important issue and\n  \
    \    the 0-byte RTP compression scheme should therefore have as much as\n    \
    \  possible in common with the regular IP/UDP/RTP profile.\n   -  Unidirectional\
    \ links: It is of less importance that the 0-byte\n      header compression scheme\
    \ be able to also work over unidirectional\n      links.\n      Justification:\
    \ 0-byte header compression targets links that\n      typically are bi-directional.\n"
