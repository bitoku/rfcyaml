  - "1.  Introduction\n   Any time a client's DHCP packet is broadcast, a local DHCP
    relay will\n   process its request and forward it on to the DHCP server.  When
    the\n   DHCP relay performs this function, it can be configured to use the\n   DHCP
    relay agent information option to forward additional information\n   to the DHCP
    server, which the server may then use to alter its\n   processing algorithms.
    \ Once the lease has been granted, however,\n   future DHCP DHCPREQUEST/RENEWAL
    messages are unicast directly to the\n   DHCP Server [RFC2131] [RFC2132] [RFC3046].\n
    \  In general, DHCP servers may also make subtle (and sometimes not so\n   subtle)
    changes in their processing algorithms depending on whether\n   or not the DHCP
    server received the message as a unicast packet from\n   the DHCP client directly,
    a broadcast packet from the DHCP client on\n   a locally connected network, or
    a unicast packet from a DHCP Relay\n   Agent, which has forwarded on a packet
    broadcast from a DHCP client\n   connected to a network local to the DHCP Relay
    Agent.\n   In some situations, DHCP Clients may unicast their DHCPREQUEST/RENEW\n
    \  packets to the DHCP Relay Agent, which will forward the packet on to\n   the
    DHCP server.  In these cases, the DHCP server cannot tell whether\n   the packet
    was broadcast or unicast by the DHCP client, and so it may\n   be unable to process
    the DHCP client packets in the manner that it\n   would if it knew whether the
    original DHCP packet was broadcast or\n   unicast.  For example, a server might
    be willing to NAK a client in\n   the REBINDING state based on a determination
    that the client's\n   address does not match its location in the network, but
    might not be\n   willing to do so if the client is in the RENEWING state.\n   The
    purpose of the suboption described in this document is to allow\n   the DHCP relay
    to specify flags for the forwarded packet.  These\n   flags can be used to describe
    DHCP client attributes that are useful\n   to the DHCP server, but can only be
    detected by the local DHCP relay.\n   The DHCP server can use the information
    provided by the DHCP relay to\n   improve its processing algorithms.\n   One flag
    is defined to indicate whether the DHCP relay received the\n   packet via a unicast
    or broadcast packet.  This allows the DHCP\n   server to know if a packet forwarded
    on by a DHCP Relay Agent was\n   broadcast or unicast to the DHCP Relay Agent.\n"

  - "4.  DHCP Relay Agent Behavior\n   A DHCP relay agent that claims to conform to
    this specification MUST\n   include this suboption in every Relay Agent Information
    Option\n   [RFC3046] it adds to a forwarded DHCP request.  In this way, the DHCP\n
    \  server can distinguish a request forwarded from a DHCP relay agent\n   that
    does not support the relay-agent-flags suboption from a request\n   forwarded
    by a DHCP relay agent that supports the relay-agent-flags\n   suboption, and which
    received the request that is being forwarded in\n   a broadcast packet.\n   To
    put this another way, A DHCP relay agent that supports the relay-\n   agent-flags
    suboption MUST always include it in every relay-agent-\n   information-option
    that it inserts into packets that it forwards on\n   to the DHCP server, whether
    the packet it is forwarding was received\n   as a broadcast or as a unicast.  This
    is because the DHCP server will\n   be dealing with DHCP relay agents that support
    the relay-agent-flags\n   suboption as well as DHCP relay agents that do not support
    the relay-\n   agent-flags suboption.\n"

  - "5.  DHCP Server Behavior\n   This option provides additional information to the
    DHCP server.  The\n   DHCP server MAY use this information to make processing
    decisions\n   regarding the DHCP Client's packet that it is processing.  For\n
    \  instance, knowledge of the broadcast or unicast reception of a packet\n   by
    a DHCP relay agent could be used when making the processing\n   decisions required
    to implement Load Balancing [RFC3074].  A load-\n   balancing server may be willing
    to respond to a REBINDING client, but\n   the server cannot determine the client's
    state without this\n   additional indication.\n   The option length is one octet.
    \ If the DHCP server receives a relay-\n   agent-flags suboption that is longer
    than one octet, it MUST evaluate\n   the first octet.\n   Note to implementors:
    In specifying the behavior of new flags bits in\n   the future, careful attention
    must be paid to compatibility with\n   earlier implementations.  If additional
    flags values are defined in\n   the future, it will not always be possible to
    distinguish between\n   messages from relay agents who understand the new value
    and set its\n   value to 'zero', and relay agents who are simply setting a series
    of\n   unassigned bits to 'zero'.  It would be a mistake to specify\n   significant
    behavior changes based on 'zero' values of flags\n   specified in the future.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Message authentication in DHCP for intradomain
    use, where the out-of-\n   band exchange of a shared secret is feasible, is defined
    in\n   [RFC3118].  Potential exposures to attack are discussed in Section 7\n
    \  of the DHCP protocol specification in [RFC2131].\n   The DHCP Relay Agent option
    depends on a trusted relationship between\n   the DHCP relay agent and the server,
    as described in Section 5 of\n   [RFC3046].  While the introduction of fraudulent
    relay-agent options\n   can be prevented by a perimeter defense that blocks these
    options\n   unless the relay agent is trusted, a deeper defense using the\n   authentication
    option for relay agent options [RFC4030] SHOULD be\n   deployed as well.\n"
