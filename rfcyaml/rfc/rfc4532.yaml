  - "Abstract\n   This specification provides a mechanism for Lightweight Directory\n
    \  Access Protocol (LDAP) clients to obtain the authorization identity\n   the
    server has associated with the user or application entity.  This\n   mechanism
    is specified as an LDAP extended operation called the LDAP\n   \"Who am I?\" operation.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Background and Intent of Use\n   This specification describes a Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol\n   (LDAP) [RFC4510] operation that clients can use
    to obtain the primary\n   authorization identity, in its primary form, that the
    server has\n   associated with the user or application entity.  The operation
    is\n   called the \"Who am I?\" operation.\n   This specification is intended
    to replace the existing Authorization\n   Identity Controls [RFC3829] mechanism,
    which uses Bind request and\n   response controls to request and return the authorization
    identity.\n   Bind controls are not protected by security layers established by
    the\n   Bind operation that includes them.  While it is possible to establish\n
    \  security layers using StartTLS [RFC4511][RFC4513] prior to the Bind\n   operation,
    it is often desirable to use security layers established\n   by the Bind operation.
    \ An extended operation sent after a Bind\n   operation is protected by the security
    layers established by the Bind\n   operation.\n   There are other cases where
    it is desirable to request the\n   authorization identity that the server associated
    with the client\n   separately from the Bind operation.  For example, the \"Who
    am I?\"\n   operation can be augmented with a Proxied Authorization Control\n
    \  [RFC4370] to determine the authorization identity that the server\n   associates
    with the identity asserted in the Proxied Authorization\n   Control.  The \"Who
    am I?\" operation can also be used prior to the\n   Bind operation.\n   Servers
    often associate multiple authorization identities with the\n   client, and each
    authorization identity may be represented by\n   multiple authzId [RFC4513] strings.
    \ This operation requests and\n   returns the authzId that the server considers
    primary.  In the\n   specification, the term \"the authorization identity\" and
    \"the\n   authzId\" are generally to be read as \"the primary authorization\n
    \  identity\" and the \"the primary authzId\", respectively.\n"

      \  would be encoded as the sequence of octets (in hex):\n      30 21 02 01 02

  title: 2.  The "Who am I?" Operation
- contents:
  - "3.  Operational Semantics\n   The \"Who am I?\" operation provides a mechanism,
    a whoami Request, for\n   the client to request that the server return the authorization\n
    \  identity it currently associates with the client.  It also provides a\n   mechanism,
    a whoami Response, for the server to respond to that\n   request.\n   Servers
    indicate their support for this extended operation by\n   providing a whoamiOID
    object identifier as a value of the\n   'supportedExtension' attribute type in
    their root DSE.  The server\n   SHOULD advertise this extension only when the
    client is willing and\n   able to perform this operation.\n   If the server is
    willing and able to provide the authorization\n   identity it associates with
    the client, the server SHALL return a\n   whoami Response with a success resultCode.
    \ If the server is treating\n   the client as an anonymous entity, the response
    field is present but\n   empty.  Otherwise, the server provides the authzId [RFC4513]\n
    \  representing the authorization identity it currently associates with\n   the
    client in the response field.\n   If the server is unwilling or unable to provide
    the authorization\n   identity it associates with the client, the server SHALL
    return a\n   whoami Response with an appropriate non-success resultCode (such
    as\n   operationsError, protocolError, confidentialityRequired,\n   insufficientAccessRights,
    busy, unavailable, unwillingToPerform, or\n   other) and an absent response field.\n
    \  As described in [RFC4511] and [RFC4513], an LDAP session has an\n   \"anonymous\"
    association until the client has been successfully\n   authenticated using the
    Bind operation.  Clients MUST NOT invoke the\n   \"Who am I?\" operation while
    any Bind operation is in progress,\n   including between two Bind requests made
    as part of a multi-stage\n   Bind operation.  Where a whoami Request is received
    in violation of\n   this absolute prohibition, the server should return a whoami
    Response\n   with an operationsError resultCode.\n"
  title: 3.  Operational Semantics
- contents:
  - "4.  Extending the \"Who am I?\" Operation with Controls\n   Future specifications
    may extend the \"Who am I?\" operation using the\n   control mechanism [RFC4511].
    \ When extended by controls, the \"Who am\n   I?\" operation requests and returns
    the authorization identity the\n   server associates with the client in a particular
    context indicated\n   by the controls.\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  Proxied Authorization Control\n   The Proxied Authorization Control [RFC4370]
      is used by clients to\n   request that the operation it is attached to operate
      under the\n   authorization of an assumed identity.  The client provides the\n
      \  identity to assume in the Proxied Authorization request control.  If\n   the
      client is authorized to assume the requested identity, the server\n   executes
      the operation as if the requested identity had issued the\n   operation.\n   As
      servers often map the asserted authzId to another identity\n   [RFC4513], it
      is desirable to request that the server provide the\n   authzId it associates
      with the assumed identity.\n   When a Proxied Authorization Control is be attached
      to the \"Who am\n   I?\"  operation, the operation requests the return of the
      authzId the\n   server associates with the identity asserted in the Proxied\n
      \  Authorization Control.  The authorizationDenied (123) result code is\n   used
      to indicate that the server does not allow the client to assume\n   the asserted
      identity.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Identities associated with users may be sensitive
    information.  When\n   they are, security layers [RFC4511][RFC4513] should be
    established to\n   protect this information.  This mechanism is specifically designed
    to\n   allow security layers established by a Bind operation to protect the\n
    \  integrity and/or confidentiality of the authorization identity.\n   Servers
    may place access control or other restrictions upon the use\n   of this operation.
    \ As stated in Section 3, the server SHOULD\n   advertise this extension when
    it is willing and able to perform the\n   operation.\n   As with any other extended
    operations, general LDAP security\n   considerations [RFC4510] apply.\n"
