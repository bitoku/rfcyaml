  - "1. Introduction\n   March 25 to March 27, 1998 the Internet Architecture Board\
    \ (IAB) held\n   a workshop on Routing.  The workshop focused on current problems\n\
    \   within the Internet and the long term solutions that should be\n   addressed.\
    \  This document summarizes the discussions the group had on\n   routing, and\
    \ lists the conclusions reached by the workshop.  Section\n   2 lists the conclusions\
    \ reached by the participants of the workshop\n   and the suggestions for additional\
    \ work or redirection of current\n   work.  Sections 2.1-2.10 attempt to extract\
    \ the major points of what\n   was, in actuality, many multifaceted discussions,\
    \ sometimes occurring\n   all at the same time.  Appendix A contains a list of\
    \ the participants\n   who attended the workshop.  The full body of the report\
    \ can be found\n   at http://www.iab.org.\n   The topics covered at length during\
    \ the IAB workshop were:\n    1. Scaling of Unicast Routing and Addressing (section\
    \ 2.1)\n    2. Unicast Addressing Issues (Section 2.2)\n    3. The Effect of extending\
    \ IP version 4 in the Internet by using\n       Network Address Transformation\
    \ boxes (Section 2.3)\n    4. Multicast Routing (Section 2.4)\n    5. Routing\
    \ Instability (Section 2.5)\n    6. Quality of Service Routing (Section 2.6)\n\
    \    7. Routing Security (Section 2.7)\n    8. BGP Policy (Section 2.8)\n    9.\
    \ Flows of information from network routing to hosts for improved\n       services\
    \ (Section 2.9)\n   In addition the following topics were briefly covered:\n \
    \   a. Multi-strand trunking\n    b. Better tools for monitoring and diagnosis\
    \ of network problems\n    c. Routing protocol bandwidth minimization\n    d.\
    \ Automatic renumbering and automatic organization\n    e. Anycast\n    f. Load-sensitive\
    \ routing\n    g. Geographical addressing\n   These shorter topics are contained\
    \ in section 2.10.\n   It would be unrealistic to assume that the workshop had\
    \ definitive\n   answers to all the technical problems that were raised.  The\
    \ best\n   that can be hoped is that we raised most of the relevant issues and\n\
    \   gave opinions that were the best guess of the people at the meeting,\n   keeping\
    \ in mind that the attendees did not come armed with data to\n   back up opinions.\
    \  Much of the discussion amounted to an exploration\n   of the intuition of the\
    \ experts in attendance, intuition gained after\n   years of experience in making\
    \ the Internet work.  More work is needed\n   to validate the intuition and experience\
    \ by way of scientific\n   experimentation and analysis.  Unfortunately, it's\
    \ not so easy to\n   find a spare collection of global Internets upon which one\
    \ might\n   perform controlled experiments.\n"

    \ term systemic issues that may eventually overwhelm the\n       unicast routing\

    \        -  Multi-homing\n    3. We'd like more research into what's breaking;\
    \ not just more data,\n       but more analysis of the data\n   The group reviewed\
    \ the following potential solutions:\n    -  Architected NAT (improving the existing\
    \ Network Address\n       Translation schemes to provide better scaling)\n   \
    \ -  IPv6 (deploying an IP version 6 infrastructure)\n    -  MAP/Encap (map to\
    \ aggregatable addresses and encapsulate the\n       original packet)\n    - \
    \ Do nothing\n    -  Aggressive renumbering (try to continue to encourage renumbering\n\
    \       to improve utilization of the IP version 4 address space)\n    -  Metro\
    \ addressing (use a geographical or metropolitan based\n       addressing scheme)\n"

  - "2.2. Levels of Addressing of Addressing and Routing\n   Levels of hierarchy do\
    \ not matter to the customers.  Address\n   hierarchy must be distinguished from\
    \ routing hierarchy.  The group\n   examined whether the current Internet has\
    \ enough levels of hierarchy\n   in Internet addresses or routing infrastructure.\
    \  The group did not\n   find that levels of hierarchy should be added to the\
    \ Internet, at\n   least for now.  Flat routing at the AS level seems to be workable;\
    \ if\n   this changes in the future, hierarchy would need to be revisited, and\n\
    \   studied with due consideration to convergence time for routing\n   algorithms\
    \ and trust management.  There is no universal agreement\n   that adding levels\
    \ of hierarchy at this point in time provides a\n   well-defined benefit.  Furthermore,\
    \ two levels is difficult for many\n   people, and any more than that is difficult\
    \ both to build and to use.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.1. Multicast - Conclusions\n   Since the multicast model was created, many\
    \ multicast applications\n   have been tried over the Internet multicast routing\
    \ fabric.  The\n   group began to discuss the multicast model in terms of enabling\n\
    \   multicast applications to run efficiently, and scale favorably with\n   future\
    \ growth.  Multicast applications place varying requirements on\n   multicast\
    \ routing.\n   Multicast applications may have a variable:\n    -  number of sources,\n\
    \    -  number of receivers,\n    -  amount of data,\n    -  amount of data in\
    \ a burst, and length of quiet periods\n    -  number of groups utilized per application\
    \ or per set of\n       cooperating applications, and\n    -  amount of time during\
    \ which the group exists\n    -  topological distance between members of the group.\n\
    \    -  volatility of membership\n   Multicast routing must provide the flexibility\
    \ to support the varying\n   requirements of different multicast applications.\
    \  The current\n   multicast model establishes multicast routing paths upon reception\
    \ of\n   a data packet.  The discussion on the viability of the multicast\n  \
    \ model examined the viability of the model in terms of the uses of\n   multicast\
    \ routing by applications and the scalability to full\n   Internet usage.  For\
    \ example, providing for many groups of small\n   conferences (a small number\
    \ of widely-dispersed people) with global\n   topological scope scales badly given\
    \ the current multicast model.\n   The group felt the existing multicast protocols\
    \ and multicast should\n   be evaluated in terms of the requirements listed above.\
    \  The group\n   suggested that the evaluation should include the multicast protocols\n\
    \   DVMRP [12], MOSPF [8], PIM [4], CBT [2], and Express [5], as well as\n   the\
    \ following mechanisms used by multicast applications:\n    1. Registering with\
    \ the core or the RP (Rendezvous Point),\n    2. Having the ID of the group include\
    \ the core, and having joins\n       specify the core\n    3. Having the ID of\
    \ the group include the core, and having joins\n       and data specify both\n\
    \    4. Sending data via unicast to all members, and\n    5. Sending data via\
    \ unicast transport to the RP.\n   The group acknowledged that the current multicast\
    \ model does not\n   scale well for all scenarios that applications use.\n   The\
    \ group noted that reliable multicast is surprisingly orthogonal to\n   the issues\
    \ about the scaling of the multicast model to all possible\n   applications.\n"

    \ enhances stability, but possibly\n   at the cost of reachability for some prefixes.\
    \  A prefix can be\n   damped and reachable via another path, so that for such\
    \ prefixes the\n   effects of damping are less serious than for other prefixes.\
    \  The\n   performance of various algorithms for enhancing stability should be\n\
    \   measured by recording whether the affected route prefixes are\n   reachable\
    \ or not reachable.  Using current damping approaches,\n   approximately 1% of\
    \ the prefixes are affected at any one point in\n   time.  We should try to find\
    \ out how many prefixes are unreachable\n   because of damping.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.6. ToS/CoS/QoS\n   The group noted that the terms Type of Service (ToS), Class\
    \ of\n   Service (CoS), and Quality of Service (QoS) are imprecise as\n   currently\
    \ used.  The discussion started by defining the terminology\n   as follows:\n\
    \   ToS:  hop by hop routing based on destination plus ToS bits [9]\n   CoS: \
    \ classes of service based on service contracts.  These classes\n         of service\
    \ are enabled by a variety of mechanisms which include\n         queueing, and\
    \ multiple physical or link level paths.\n   QoS:  managing routes that meet certain\
    \ quality of service constraints,\n         and involving the following steps:\n\
    \          *  routing the resource requests\n          *  setting up a path that\
    \ satisfies the constraints\n          *  routing the data\n   There is no smooth\
    \ dividing line between between ToS and QoS. ToS is\n   relative.  QoS is absolute.\
    \  The group discussed whether there is a\n   demand for ToS, CoS and QoS. Differentiated-services\
    \ [3] as discussed\n   in the IETF is ToS++.\n   The group also discussed a more\
    \ general concept of \"Constraint Based\n   Routing\" which was defined as traffic\
    \ engineering on large aggregated\n   flows.  Constraint based routing allows\
    \ the providers to better\n   utilize the bandwidth in their network to handle\
    \ traffic requests\n   from users.  Besides enabling policy management techniques,\n\
    \   constraint based routing allows providers to route traffic based on\n   the\
    \ characteristics of the traffic flows.\n"

  - "2.10.2.1. Routing Diagnostics - Conclusions\n   1. It would be nice to have an\
    \ Authoritative Database listing those\n      prefixes permitted from each AS.\
    \ The authoritative data base was\n      attempted before without success, but\
    \ the group felt it might be\n      useful to try again.\n   2. SNMP version 3\
    \ should be deployed in order to make use of its\n      improved authentication,\
    \ scope and rate limiting\n   3. Remotely-controlled traffic monitors should be\
    \ used to measure\n      traffic\n   4. Better tools are needed for preventative\
    \ problem detection\n"

- title: 2.10.4.1. Load Sensitive IGP - Conclusions
  contents:
  - "2.10.4.1. Load Sensitive IGP - Conclusions\n   While load sensitive routing is\
    \ interesting in some ways, it cannot\n   be considered until certain problems\
    \ are worked out.  Currently,\n   constraint based routing is assigning administrative\
    \ metrics to allow\n   routing to adapt to different traffic patterns.  Load sensitive\n\
    \   routing may increase oscillation and instability of routes.  This\n   instability\
    \ of routes, sometimes called churn, may affect the ability\n   of the routing\
    \ infrastructure to scale.\n   Load sensitive routing would allow IGPs to better\
    \ utilize links.\n   Past and current efforts in load sensitive routing include:\
    \  QoS OSPF\n   [10], Q-OSPF [10], and load sensitive routers developed by BBN.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2. Action Items for IETF Working Group Chairs\n   1. NAT: Forward our concerns,\
    \ problems and suggestions to the\n      appropriate working groups\n   2. We\
    \ recommend that IETF should work the issue of Constraint Based\n      Routing.\n\
    \   3. The IETF should encourage work on \"wire speed\" authentication,\n    \
    \  pair-wise authentication of routers in routing protocols, and\n      Byzantine\
    \ robustness in routing protocols.\n   4. Concerns about the Routing Policy Specification\
    \ Language (RPSL)\n      should go to the Routing Policy Systems (RPS) working\
    \ group chair.\n   5. The group recommends a BOF be held on Measuring Path\n \
    \     Characteristics.  The BOF should consider the data exchange format\n   \
    \   of measurement and mechanisms to distribution of data mechanism.\n      It\
    \ is noted that the IPPM working group is dealing with issues\n      within the\
    \ measurement problem space.\n   6. There is layer two work which should be done\
    \ to support the\n      multiple parallel trunks which is outside the scope of\
    \ the IETF.\n      Layer three routing should support richer metrics in OSPF.\n\
    \   7. SNMP version 3 working groups should be notified about the issues\n   \
    \   about authentication, scope, and rate limiting.\n   8. A BOF should be held\
    \ to plan work on anycast.  A document on\n      anycast should be part of the\
    \ proposed working group charter.\n"

    \ of routing data, not just the collection\n      of more data.\n   2. Encourage\
    \ evaluation and written reports on the evaluation of\n      multicast protocols\
    \ and mechanisms for different types of\n      protocols\n   3. The IRTF Routing\
    \ Research group chair and the Routing Area\n      Director should discuss Load\
