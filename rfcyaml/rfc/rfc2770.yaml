- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This describes an experimental policy for use of the class D address\n\
    \   space using 233/8 as the experimental statically assigned subset of\n   the\
    \ class D address space. This new experimental allocation is in\n   addition to\
    \ those described on [IANA] (e.g. [RFC2365]).\n   This memo is a product of the\
    \ Multicast Deployment Working Group\n   (MBONED) in the Operations and Management\
    \ Area of the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force. Submit comments to <mboned@ns.uoregon.edu>\

- title: 1. Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "1. Problem Statement\n   Multicast addresses have traditionally been allocated\
    \ by a dynamic\n   mechanism such as SDR [SAP]. However, many current multicast\n\
    \   deployment models are not amenable to dynamic allocation. For\n   example,\
    \ many content aggregators require group addresses which are\n   fixed on a time\
    \ scale which is not amenable to allocation by a\n   mechanism such as described\
    \ in [SAP]. Perhaps more seriously, since\n   there isn't general consensus by\
    \ providers, content aggregators, or\n   application writers as to the allocation\
    \ mechanism, the Internet is\n   left without a coherent multicast address allocation\
    \ scheme.\n   The MALLOC working group is looking at a specific strategy for global\n\
    \   multicast address allocation [MADCAP, MASC]. This experiment will\n   proceed\
    \ in parallel. MADCAP may be employed within AS's, if so\n   desired.\n   This\
    \ document proposes an experimental method of statically\n   allocating multicast\
    \ addresses with global scope. This experiment\n   will last for a period of one\
    \ year, but may be extended as described\n   in section 6.\n"
- title: 2. Address Space
  contents:
  - "2. Address Space\n   For purposes of the experiment described here, the IANA\
    \ has allocated\n   233/8. The remaining 24 bits will be administered in a manner\
    \ similar\n   to that described in RFC 1797:\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2\
    \ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \      |      233      |           16 bits AS          |  local bits   |\n   \
    \   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n"
- title: 2.1. Example
  contents:
  - "2.1. Example\n   Consider, for example, AS 5662. Written in binary, left padded\
    \ with\n   0s, we get 0001011000011110. Mapping the high order octet to the\n\
    \   second octet of the address, and the low order octet to the third\n   octet,\
    \ we get 233.22.30/24.\n"
- title: 3. Allocation
  contents:
  - "3. Allocation\n   As mentioned above, the allocation proposed here follows the\
    \ RFC 1797\n   (case 1) allocation scheme, modified as follows: the high order\
    \ octet\n   has the value 233, and the next 16 bits are a previously assigned\n\
    \   Autonomous System number (AS), as registered by a network registry\n   and\
    \ listed in the RWhois database system. This allows a single /24\n   per AS.\n\
    \   As was the case with RFC 1797, using the AS number in this way allows\n  \
    \ the experiment to get underway quickly in that it automatically\n   allocates\
    \ some addresses to each service provider and does not\n   require a registration\
    \ step.\n"
- title: 3.1. Private AS Space
  contents:
  - "3.1. Private AS Space\n   The address space mapped to the private AS space [RFC1930]\
    \ is\n   reserved for future allocation.\n"
- title: 4. Transition from GLOP to Other Address Allocation Schemes
  contents:
  - "4. Transition from GLOP to Other Address Allocation Schemes\n   It may not be\
    \ necessary to transition from the address allocation\n   scheme described here\
    \ to a more dynamic approach (see, e.g., [MASC]).\n   The reasoning here is that\
    \ the statically assigned addresses taken\n   from 233/8 may be sufficient for\
    \ those applications which must have\n   static addressing, and any other addressing\
    \ can come from either a\n   dynamic mechanism such as [MASC], the administratively\
    \ scoped address\n   space [RFC2365], or the Single-source address space [SS].\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   The approach described here may have the effect\
    \ of reduced exposure\n   to denial of space attacks based on dynamic allocation.\
    \ Further,\n   since dynamic assignment does not cross domain boundaries, well\
    \ known\n   intra-domain security techniques can be applied.\n"
- title: 6. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. IANA Considerations\n   IANA has allocated 233/8 for experimental assignments.\
    \ This\n   assignment should timeout one year after the assignment is made. The\n\
    \   assignment may be renewed at that time. It should be noted that the\n   experiment\
    \ described here is in the same spirit the experiment\n   described in [RFC1797].\n"
- title: 7. Acknowledgments
  contents:
  - "7. Acknowledgments\n   This idea originated with Peter Lothberg's idea that we\
    \ use the same\n   allocation (AS based) as described in RFC 1797 in the class\
    \ D address\n   space. Randy Bush and Mark Handley contributed many insightful\n\
    \   comments.\n"
