  - "1.  Introduction\n   The purpose of this document is to describe coexistence\
    \ between\n   version 2 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework\
    \ [1-\n   6], termed the SNMP version 2 framework (SNMPv2), and the original\n\
    \   Internet-standard Network Management Framework (SNMPv1), which\n   consists\
    \ of these three documents:\n      STD 16, RFC 1155 [7] which defines the Structure\
    \ of Management\n      Information (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and\
    \ naming\n      objects for the purpose of management.\n      STD 16, RFC 1212\
    \ [8] which defines a more concise description\n      mechanism, which is wholly\
    \ consistent with the SMI.\n      STD 15, RFC 1157 [9] which defines the Simple\
    \ Network Management\n      Protocol (SNMP), the protocol used for network access\
    \ to managed\n      objects.\n"
- title: 2.  Management Information
  contents:
  - "2.  Management Information\n   The SNMPv2 approach towards describing collections\
    \ of managed objects\n   is nearly a proper superset of the approach defined in\
    \ the Internet-\n   standard Network Management Framework.  For example, both\
    \ approaches\n   use ASN.1 [10] as the basis for a formal descriptive notation.\n\
    \   Indeed, one might note that the SNMPv2 approach largely codifies the\n   existing\
    \ practice for defining MIB modules, based on extensive\n   experience with the\
    \ current framework.\n   The SNMPv2 documents which deal with information modules\
    \ are:\n     Structure of Management Information for SNMPv2 [1], which defines\n\
    \     concise notations for describing information modules, managed\n     objects\
    \ and notifications;\n     Textual Conventions for SNMPv2 [2], which defines a\
    \ concise\n     notation for describing textual conventions, and also defines\
    \ some\n     initial conventions; and,\n     Conformance Statements for SNMPv2\
    \ [3], which defines concise\n     notation for describing compliance and capabilities\
    \ statements.\n   The following sections consider the three areas:  MIB modules,\n\
    \   compliance statements, and capabilities statements.\n   MIB modules defined\
    \ using the current framework may continue to be\n   used with the SNMPv2 protocol.\
    \  However, for the MIB modules to\n   conform to the SNMPv2 framework, the following\
    \ changes are required:\n"

    \ document [11] uses the\n   MODULE-CONFORMANCE macro to describe an agent's capabilities\
    \ with\n   respect to one or more MIB modules.  Converting such a description\n\
    \   for use with the SNMPv2 framework requires these changes:\n   (1)  Use the\
    \ macro name AGENT-CAPABILITIES instead of MODULE-\n        CONFORMANCE.\n   (2)\
    \  The STATUS clause must be added.\n   (3)  For all occurrences of the CREATION-REQUIRES\
    \ clause, note the\n        slight change in semantics, and omit this clause if\
    \ appropriate.\n   In order to ease the coexistence between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2,\
    \ object\n   groups defined in an SNMPv1 MIB module may be referenced by the\n\
    \   INCLUDES clause of an invocation of the AGENT-CAPABILITIES macro:\n   upon\
    \ encountering a reference to an OBJECT IDENTIFIER subtree defined\n   in an SNMPv1\
    \ MIB module, all leaf objects which are subordinate to\n   the subtree and have\
    \ a STATUS clause value of mandatory are deemed to\n   be INCLUDEd.  (Note that\
    \ this method is ambiguous when different\n   revisions of a SNMPv1 MIB have different\
    \ sets of mandatory objects\n   under the same subtree; in such cases, the only\
    \ solution is to\n   rewrite the MIB using the SNMPv2 SMI in order to define the\

    \ Trap-PDU; and, snmpTrapOID.0 [6], which is\n     calculated thusly:  if the\
