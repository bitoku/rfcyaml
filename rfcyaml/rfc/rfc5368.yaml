  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 3261 (SIP) [RFC3261] is extended by RFC 3515 [RFC3515]
    with a\n   REFER method that allows a user agent (UA) to request a second UA to\n
    \  send a SIP request to a third party.  For example, if Alice is in a\n   call
    with Bob, and decides Bob needs to talk to Carol, Alice can\n   instruct her SIP
    UA to send a REFER request to Bob's UA providing\n   Carol's SIP Contact information.
    \ Assuming Bob has given it\n   permission, Bob's UA will attempt to call Carol
    using that contact.\n   That is, it will send an INVITE request to that contact.\n
    \  A number of applications need to request this second UA to initiate\n   transactions
    towards a set of destinations.  In one example, the\n   moderator of a conference
    may want the conference server to send BYE\n   requests to a group of participants.
    \ In another example, the same\n   moderator may want the conference server to
    INVITE a set of new\n   participants.\n   We define an extension to the REFER
    method so that REFER requests can\n   be used to refer other user agents (such
    as conference servers) to\n   multiple destinations.  In addition, this mechanism
    uses the\n   suppression of the REFER method implicit subscription specified in\n
    \  RFC 4488 [RFC4488].\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119\n
    \  [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant\n   implementations.\n
    \  This document reuses the following terminology defined in RFC 3261\n   [RFC3261]:\n
    \  o  User Agent (UA)\n   o  User Agent Client (UAC)\n   o  User Agent Server
    (UAS)\n   This document defines the following new terms:\n   REFER-Issuer:  a
    user agent issuing a REFER request.\n   REFER-Recipient:  an entity receiving
    a REFER request and forwarding\n      a SIP request to a number of REFER-Targets.
    \ The REFER-Recipient\n      is typically a network entity, such as a URI-list
    server, that\n      acts as a UAS for REFER requests and as a UAC for other SIP\n
    \     requests.\n   REFER-Target:  a UA of the intended final recipient of a SIP
    request\n      generated by the REFER-Recipient.\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Overview of Operation\n   This document describes an application of URI-list
    services [RFC5363]\n   that allows a URI-list service to receive a SIP REFER request\n
    \  containing a list of targets.  The URI-list service invokes the\n   requested
    SIP method to each of the targets contained in the list.\n   This type of URI-list
    service is referred to as a REFER-Recipient\n   throughout this document.\n   This
    document defines an extension to the SIP REFER method specified\n   in RFC 3515
    [RFC3515] that allows a SIP UAC to include a URI list as\n   specified in RFC
    4826 [RFC4826] of REFER-Targets in a REFER request\n   and send it to a REFER-Recipient.
    \ The REFER-Recipient creates a new\n   SIP request for each entry in the URI
    list and sends it to each\n   REFER-Recipient.\n   The URI list that contains
    the list of targets is used in conjunction\n   with RFC 5364 [RFC5364] to allow
    the sender indicate the role (e.g.,\n   'to', 'cc', or anonymous) in which the
    REFER-Target is involved in\n   the signalling.\n   We represent multiple targets
    of a REFER request using a URI list as\n   specified in RFC 4826 [RFC4826].  A
    REFER-Issuer that wants to refer\n   a REFER-Recipient to a set of destinations
    creates a SIP REFER\n   request.  The Refer-To header contains a pointer to a
    URI list, which\n   is included in a body part, and an option-tag in the Require
    header\n   field: \"multiple-refer\".  This option-tag indicates the requirement\n
    \  to support the functionality described in this specification.\n   When the
    REFER-Recipient receives such a request, it creates a new\n   request per REFER-Target
    and sends them, one to each REFER-Target.\n   This document does not provide any
    mechanism for REFER-Issuers to\n   find out about the results of a REFER request
    containing multiple\n   REFER-Targets.  Furthermore, it does not provide support
    for the\n   implicit subscription mechanism that is part of the SIP REFER method.\n
    \  The way REFER-Issuers are kept informed about the results of a REFER\n   is
    service specific.  For example, a REFER-Issuer sending a REFER\n   request to
    invite a set of participants to a conference can discover\n   which participants
    were successfully brought into the conference by\n   subscribing to the conference
    state event package specified in RFC\n   4575 [RFC4575].\n"
  title: 3.  Overview of Operation
- contents:
  - "4.  The multiple-refer SIP Option-Tag\n   We define a new SIP option-tag for
    the Require and Supported header\n   fields: \"multiple-refer\".\n   A user agent
    including the \"multiple-refer\" option-tag in a Supported\n   header field indicates
    compliance with this specification.\n   A user agent generating a REFER with a
    pointer to a URI list in its\n   Refer-To header field MUST include the \"multiple-refer\"
    option-tag in\n   the Require header field of the REFER.\n"
  title: 4.  The multiple-refer SIP Option-Tag
- contents:
  - "5.  Suppressing REFER's Implicit Subscription\n   REFER requests with a single
    REFER-Target establish implicitly a\n   subscription to the refer event.  The
    REFER-Issuer is informed about\n   the result of the transaction towards the REFER-Target
    through this\n   implicit subscription.  As described in RFC 3515 [RFC3515], NOTIFY\n
    \  requests sent as a result of an implicit subscription created by a\n   REFER
    request contain a body of type \"message/sipfrag\", RFC 3420\n   [RFC3420], that
    describes the status of the transaction initiated by\n   the REFER-Recipient.\n
    \  In the case of a REFER-Issuer that generates a REFER with multiple\n   REFER-targets,
    the REFER-Issuer is typically already subscribed to\n   other event packages that
    can provide the information about the\n   result of the transactions towards the
    REFER-Targets.  For example, a\n   moderator instructing a conference server to
    send a BYE request to a\n   set of participants is usually subscribed to the conference
    state\n   event package for the conference.  Notifications to this event\n   package
    will keep the moderator and the rest of the subscribers\n   informed of the current
    list of conference participants.\n   Most of the applications using the multiple
    REFER technology\n   described in this memo do not need its implicit subscription.\n
    \  Consequently, a SIP REFER-Issuer generating a REFER request with\n   multiple
    REFER-Targets SHOULD include the \"norefersub\" option-tag in\n   a Require header
    field and SHOULD include a Refer-Sub header field\n   set to \"false\" to indicate
    that no notifications about the requests\n   should be sent to the REFER-Issuer.
    \ The REFER-Recipient SHOULD honor\n   the suggestion and also include a Refer-Sub
    header field set to\n   \"false\" in the 200 (OK) response.  The \"norefersub\"
    SIP option-tag\n   and the Refer-Sub header field are specified in RFC 4488 [RFC4488].\n
    \     RFC 4488 [RFC4488] indicates that a condition for the REFER-Issuer\n      to
    include a Refer-Sub header is that the REFER-Issuer is sure\n      that the REFER
    request will not fork.\n   At the time of writing, there is no extension that
    allows to report\n   the status of several transactions over the implicit subscription\n
    \  associated with a REFER dialog.  That is the motivation for this\n   document
    to recommend the usage of the \"norefersub\" option-tag.  If\n   in the future
    such an extension is defined, REFER-Issuers using it\n   could refrain from using
    the \"norefersub\" option-tag and use the new\n   extension instead.\n"
  title: 5.  Suppressing REFER's Implicit Subscription
- contents:
  - "6.  URI-List Format\n   As described in RFC 5363 [RFC5363], specifications of
    individual URI-\n   list services need to specify a default format for 'recipient-list'\n
    \  bodies used within the particular service.\n   The default format for 'recipient-list'
    bodies for REFER-Issuers and\n   REFER-Recipients is RFC 4826 [RFC4826] extended
    with RFC 5364\n   [RFC5364].  REFER-Recipients handling 'recipient-list' bodies
    MUST\n   support both of these formats.  Both REFER-Issuers and REFER-\n   Recipients
    MAY support other formats.\n   As described in RFC 5364 [RFC5364], each URI can
    be tagged with a\n   'copyControl' attribute set to either \"to\", \"cc\", or
    \"bcc\",\n   indicating the role in which the target will get the referred SIP\n
    \  request.  However, depending on the target SIP method, a\n   'copyControl'
    attribute lacks sense.  For example, while a\n   'copyControl' attribute can be
    applied to INVITE requests, it does\n   not make sense with mid-dialog requests
    such as BYE requests.\n   In addition to the 'copyControl' attribute, URIs can
    be tagged with\n   the 'anonymize' attribute (also specified in RFC 5364 [RFC5364])
    to\n   prevent that the REFER-Recipient discloses the target URI in a URI\n   list.\n
    \  Additionally, RFC 5364 [RFC5364] defines a 'recipient-list-history'\n   body
    that contains the list of targets.  The default format for\n   'recipient-list-history'
    bodies for conference services is also RFC\n   4826 [RFC4826] extended with RFC
    5364 [RFC5364].  REFER-Recipients\n   supporting this specification MUST support
    both of these formats;\n   REFER-Targets MAY support these formats.  Both REFER-Recipients
    and\n   REFER-Targets MAY support other formats.\n   Nevertheless, RFC 4826 [RFC4826]
    provides features, such as\n   hierarchical lists and the ability to include entries
    by reference\n   relative to the XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) root
    URI,\n   that are not needed by the multiple REFER service defined in this\n   document.\n
    \  Figure 1 shows an example of a flat list that follows the resource\n   list
    document.\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n   <resource-lists xmlns=\"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:resource-lists\"\n

  - "7.  Behavior of SIP REFER-Issuers\n   As indicated in Sections 4 and 5, a SIP
    REFER-Issuer that creates a\n   REFER request with multiple REFER-Targets includes
    a \"multiple-refer\"\n   and \"norefersub\" option-tags in the Require header
    field and, if\n   appropriate, a Refer-Sub header field set to \"false\".  The
    REFER-\n   Issuer includes the set of REFER-Targets in a recipient-list body\n
    \  whose disposition type is 'recipient-list', as defined in RFC 5363\n   [RFC5363].
    \ The URI-list body is further described in Section 6.\n   The Refer-To header
    field of a REFER request with multiple REFER-\n   Targets MUST contain a pointer
    (i.e., a Content-ID Uniform Resource\n   Locator (URL) as per RFC 2392 [RFC2392])
    that points to the body part\n   that carries the URI list.  The REFER-Issuer
    SHOULD NOT include any\n   particular URI more than once in the URI list.\n   RFC
    4826 [RFC4826] provides features, such as hierarchical lists and\n   the ability
    to include entries by reference relative to the XCAP root\n   URI.  However, these
    features are not needed by the multiple REFER\n   service defined in this document.
    \ Therefore, when using the default\n   resource list document, SIP REFER-Issuers
    generating REFER requests\n   with multiple REFER-Targets SHOULD use flat lists
    (i.e., no\n   hierarchical lists) and SHOULD NOT use <entry-ref> elements.\n"
  title: 7.  Behavior of SIP REFER-Issuers
- contents:
  - "8.  Behavior of REFER-Recipients\n   The REFER-Recipient follows the rules in
    Section 2.4.2 of RFC 3515\n   [RFC3515] to determine the status code of the response
    to the REFER.\n   The REFER-Recipient SHOULD not create an implicit subscription,
    and\n   SHOULD add a Refer-Sub header field set to \"false\" in the 200 OK\n   response.\n
    \  The incoming REFER request typically contains a URI-list document or\n   reference
    with the actual list of targets.  If this URI list includes\n   resources tagged
    with the 'copyControl' attribute set to a value of\n   \"to\" or \"cc\", and if
    the request is appropriate for the service,\n   e.g., it is not received mid-dialog,
    the REFER-Recipient SHOULD\n   include a URI list in each of the outgoing requests.
    \ This list\n   SHOULD be formatted according to RFC 4826 [RFC4826] and RFC 5364\n
    \  [RFC5364].  The REFER-Recipient MUST follow the procedures specified\n   in
    RFC 4826 [RFC4826] with respect to handling of the 'anonymize',\n   'count', and
    'copyControl' attributes.\n   Section 4 of RFC 5363 [RFC5363] discusses cases
    when duplicated URIs\n   are found in a URI list.  In order to avoid duplicated
    requests,\n   REFER-Recipients MUST take those actions specified in RFC 5363\n
    \  [RFC5363] into account to avoid sending a duplicated request to the\n   same
    target.\n   If the REFER-Recipient includes a URI list in an outgoing request,
    it\n   MUST include a Content-Disposition header field, specified in RFC\n   2183
    [RFC2183], with the value set to 'recipient-list-history' and a\n   'handling'
    parameter, specified in RFC 3204 [RFC3204], set to\n   \"optional\".\n   Since
    the multiple REFER service does not use hierarchical lists nor\n   lists that
    include entries by reference to the XCAP root URI, a\n   REFER-Recipient receiving
    a URI list with more information than what\n   has been described in Section 6
    MAY discard all the extra\n   information.\n   The REFER-Recipient follows the
    rules in RFC 3515 [RFC3515] to\n   generate the necessary requests towards the
    REFER-Targets, acting as\n   if it had received a regular (no URI list) REFER
    per each URI in the\n   URI list.\n"

  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   RFC 5363 [RFC5363] discusses issues related
    to SIP URI-list services.\n   Given that a REFER-Recipient accepting REFER requests
    with multiple\n   REFER-targets acts as a URI-list service, implementations of
    this\n   type of server MUST follow the security-related rules in RFC 5363\n   [RFC5363].
    \ These rules include opt-in lists and mandatory\n   authentication and authorization
    of clients.\n   Additionally, REFER-Recipients SHOULD only accept REFER requests\n
    \  within the context of an application that the REFER-Recipient\n   understands
    (e.g., a conferencing application).  This implies that\n   REFER-Recipients MUST
    NOT accept REFER requests for methods they do\n   not understand.  The idea behind
    these two rules is that REFER-\n   Recipients are not used as dumb servers whose
    only function is to\n   fan-out random messages they do not understand.\n"
