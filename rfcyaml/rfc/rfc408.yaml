  - "aid to network use for new users:\n   a single billing and account creation and\
    \ validation system,\n   so that a manager of a \"goal oriented project\" could:\n\
    \      authorize a set of user's ids to gain access to and utilize\n      resources\
    \ at the entire or a specified subset of the server\n      hosts.\n      create\
    \ a set of accounts which the users will expend, and\n      which will be used\
    \ as the breakdown for a single bill to be\n      presented to the project manager.\n\
    \   the idea is that the project manager would be required to go\n   through the\
    \ initialization process of introducing himself,\n   verifying the existence of\
    \ funding, etc. only once, and,\n   the idea would also encourage server hosts\
    \ to implement\n   systems for which usage might be projected to start at low\n\
    \   levels and grow, by allowing funded hacking by project members\n   in a controlled\
    \ manner.\n   this would require an option at login for the prospective user\n\
    \   to indicate the server should check the \"netbank\" facility at\n   the system\
    \ currently hosting it.\n    [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for\
    \ entry ]\n    [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n   \
