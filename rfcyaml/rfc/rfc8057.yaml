  - "1.  Introduction\n   Broadband Forum (BBF) is a non-profit industry alliance\
    \ driving\n   broadband wireline solutions and empowering converged packet networks\n\
    \   worldwide to better meet the needs of vendors, service providers, and\n  \
    \ their customers.  BBF develops multi-service broadband packet\n   networking\
    \ specifications that address interoperability,\n   architecture, and management.\
    \  Its work enables home, business, and\n   converged broadband services, encompassing\
    \ customer, access, and\n   backbone networks.\n   Occasionally, BBF specification\
    \ efforts require identifiers in a\n   managed namespace so that they are unique\
    \ and persistent.  To ensure\n   that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration\
    \ of three specific\n   Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC2141] Namespace Identifiers\
    \ (NIDs)\n   for use by BBF are being specified in this document, in full\n  \
    \ conformance with the NID registration process specified in [RFC3406].\n   The\
    \ \"bbf\" NID is for new work efforts related to data models for\n   protocols\
    \ other than the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) WAN\n   Management Protocol\
    \ (CWMP) [TR-069].  The \"broadband-forum-org\" and\n   \"dslforum-org\" NIDs\
    \ are used for all data models related to CWMP\n   [TR-069].  BBF has used the\
    \ latter two NIDs for many years without\n   formally registering them and has\
    \ published widely implemented\n   specifications that use these NIDs.  Use of\
    \ the \"dslforum-org\" NID\n   started prior the organization's 2008 name change\
    \ from DSL Forum to\n   Broadband Forum.\n"

- title: 6.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Namespace Considerations\n   BBF develops various specifications that require\
    \ the use of data\n   models.  URN namespaces are key constructs to manage the\
    \ definitions\n   of those data models reliably with persistence and uniqueness.\n\
    \   The use of URNs should also help specification authors to maintain\n   different\
    \ versions of URNs and dependencies between URNs, across\n   different versions\
    \ of BBF specifications, if they so wish.\n   Three NIDs are defined.  The \"\
    broadband-forum-org\" and \"dslforum-org\"\n   NIDs have been used for many years\
    \ by BBF without formal\n   registration.  (Broadband Forum changed its name from\
    \ DSL Forum in\n   2008.)  As they are referenced by multiple BBF specifications\n\
    \   currently in common use, BBF is formalizing them.  The new \"bbf\" NID\n \
    \  will be used for new work efforts that are not enhancements, updates,\n   or\
    \ extensions to work that currently makes use of the \"broadband-\n   forum-org\"\
    \ and \"dslforum-org\" NIDs.\n"
- title: 7.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Community Considerations\n   Participants involved in the development and\
    \ usage of Broadband Forum\n   specifications will benefit from the publication\
    \ of this namespace by\n   providing consistent and reliable names for the XML\
    \ namespaces,\n   schema locations, and similar identifiers of physical data models\n\
    \   published within BBF specifications.\n   The BBF specifications are publicly\
    \ available and are licensed to\n   manufacturers on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory\
    \ basis.  BBF will\n   maintain the allocation of resources for the \"bbf\", \"\
    broadband-forum-\n   org\", and \"dslforum-org\" NIDs at the following publicly\
    \ viewable\n   location: [BBF-RESOURCES].  BBF will also maintain the corresponding\n\
