  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Experience with the Domain Name System (DNS, [RFC1034] and\
    \ [RFC1035])\n   has shown that there are a number of DNS zones that all iterative\n\
    \   resolvers and recursive nameservers SHOULD automatically serve,\n   unless\
    \ intentionally configured otherwise.  These zones include, but\n   are not limited\
    \ to, the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for the address space\n   allocated by [RFC1918]\
    \ and the IP6.ARPA zones for locally assigned\n   unique local IPv6 addresses\
    \ defined in [RFC4193].\n   This recommendation is made because data has shown\
    \ that significant\n   leakage of queries for these namespaces is occurring, despite\n\
    \   instructions to restrict them, and because it has therefore become\n   necessary\
    \ to deploy sacrificial nameservers to protect the immediate\n   parent nameservers\
    \ for these zones from excessive, unintentional\n   query load [AS112] [RFC6304]\
    \ [RFC6305].  There is every expectation\n   that the query load will continue\
    \ to increase unless steps are taken\n   as outlined here.\n   Additionally, queries\
    \ from clients behind badly configured firewalls\n   that allow outgoing queries\
    \ for these namespaces, but drop the\n   responses, put a significant load on\
    \ the root servers (forward zones\n   but not reverse zones are configured). \
    \ They also cause operational\n   load for the root server operators, as they\
    \ have to reply to\n   enquiries about why the root servers are \"attacking\"\
    \ these clients.\n   Changing the default configuration will address all these\
    \ issues for\n   the zones listed in Section 4.\n   [RFC4193] recommends that\
    \ queries for D.F.IP6.ARPA be handled\n   locally.  This document extends the\
    \ recommendation to cover the\n   IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for [RFC1918] and other well-known\
    \ IN-ADDR.ARPA\n   and IP6.ARPA zones for which queries should not appear on the\
    \ public\n   Internet.\n   It is hoped that by doing this the number of sacrificial\
    \ servers\n   [AS112] will not have to be increased, and may in time be reduced.\n\
    \   This recommendation should also help DNS responsiveness for sites\n   that\
    \ are using [RFC1918] addresses but do not follow the last\n   paragraph in Section\
    \ 3 of [RFC1918].\n"

- title: 2.  Effects on Sites Using RFC 1918 Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.  Effects on Sites Using RFC 1918 Addresses\n   For most sites using [RFC1918]\
    \ addresses, the changes here will have\n   little or no detrimental effect. \
    \ If the site does not already have\n   the reverse tree populated, the only effect\
    \ will be that the name\n   error responses will be generated locally rather than\
    \ remotely.\n   For sites that do have the reverse tree populated, most will either\n\
    \   have a local copy of the zones or will be forwarding the queries to\n   servers\
    \ that have local copies of the zone.  Therefore, this\n   recommendation will\
    \ not be relevant.\n   The most significant impact will be felt at sites that\
    \ make use of\n   delegations for [RFC1918] addresses and have populated these\
    \ zones.\n   These sites will need to override the default configuration expressed\n\
    \   in this document to allow resolution to continue.  Typically, such\n   sites\
    \ will be fully disconnected from the Internet and have their own\n   root servers\
    \ for their own non-Internet DNS tree.\n"
- title: 3.  Changes to Iterative Resolver Behaviour
  contents:
  - "3.  Changes to Iterative Resolver Behaviour\n   Unless configured otherwise,\
    \ an iterative resolver will now return\n   authoritatively (AA=1) name errors\
    \ (RCODE=3) for queries within the\n   zones in Section 4, with the obvious exception\
    \ of queries for the\n   zone name itself where SOA, NS, and \"no data\" responses\
    \ will be\n   returned as appropriate to the query type.  One common way to do\
    \ this\n   all at once is to serve empty (SOA and NS only) zones.\n   An implementation\
    \ of this recommendation MUST provide a mechanism to\n   disable this new behaviour,\
    \ and SHOULD allow this decision on a zone-\n   by-zone basis.\n   If using empty\
    \ zones one SHOULD NOT use the same NS and SOA records\n   as used on the public\
    \ Internet servers, as that will make it harder\n   to detect the origin of the\
    \ responses and thus any leakage to the\n   public Internet servers.  It is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that the NS record\n   defaults to the name of the zone and the SOA MNAME defaults\
    \ to the\n   name of the only NS RR's (Resource Record's) target.  The SOA RNAME\n\
    \   SHOULD default to \"nobody.invalid.\"  [RFC2606].  Implementations\n   SHOULD\
    \ provide a mechanism to set these values.  No address records\n   need to be\
    \ provided for the nameserver.\n   Below is an example of a generic empty zone\
    \ in master file format.\n   It will produce a negative cache Time to Live (TTL)\
    \ of 3 hours.\n   @ 10800 IN SOA @ nobody.invalid. 1 3600 1200 604800 10800\n\
    \   @ 10800 IN NS @\n   The SOA RR is needed to support negative caching [RFC2308]\
    \ of name\n   error responses and to point clients to the primary master for DNS\n\
    \   dynamic updates.\n   SOA values of particular importance are the MNAME, the\
    \ SOA RR's TTL,\n   and the negTTL value.  Both TTL values SHOULD match.  The\
    \ rest of the\n   SOA timer values MAY be chosen arbitrarily since they are not\n\
    \   intended to control any zone transfer activity.\n   The NS RR is needed as\
    \ some UPDATE [RFC2136] clients use NS queries\n   to discover the zone to be\
    \ updated.  Having no address records for\n   the nameserver is expected to abort\
    \ UPDATE processing in the client.\n"

    \ addresses will be self correcting\n   as IPv6 implementations remove support\
    \ for site-local addresses.\n   However, sacrificial servers for the zones C.E.F.IP6.ARPA\

    \ or be within insecure zones.  This will allow\n   DNSSEC validation to succeed\
    \ for queries in these spaces despite not\n   being answered from the delegated\
    \ servers.\n   It is recommended that sites actively using these namespaces secure\n\
    \   them using DNSSEC [RFC4035] by publishing and using DNSSEC trust\n   anchors.\
