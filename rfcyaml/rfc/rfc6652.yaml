  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Abuse Reporting Format [ARF] defines a message format
    for sending\n   reports of abuse in the messaging infrastructure, with an eye
    toward\n   automating both the generation and consumption of those reports.\n
    \  The Sender Policy Framework [SPF] is one mechanism for message sender\n   authentication;
    it is \"path-based\", meaning it authenticates the\n   route that a message took
    from origin to destination.  The output is\n   a verified domain name that can
    then be subjected to some sort of\n   evaluation process (e.g., comparison to
    a known-good list, submission\n   to a reputation service, etc.).\n   This document
    extends [SPF] to add an optional reporting address and\n   other parameters.  Extension
    of [ARF] to add features required for\n   the reporting of these incidents is
    covered in [ARF-AUTHFAIL] and\n   [ARF-AS].\n   This document additionally creates
    a an IANA registry of [SPF] record\n   modifiers to avoid modifier namespace collisions.\n"

  - "3.  Optional Reporting Address for SPF\n   There exist cases in which an ADministrative
    Management Domain (ADMD)\n   (see [EMAIL-ARCH]) employing [SPF] for announcing
    sending practices\n   may want to know when messages are received via unauthorized
    routing.\n   Currently, there is no such method defined in conjunction with\n
    \  standardized approaches such as [ARF].  Similar information can be\n   gathered
    using a specially crafted [SPF] record and a special DNS\n   server to track [SPF]
    record lookups.\n   This document defines the following optional \"modifier\"
    (as defined\n   in Section 4.6.1 of [SPF]) to SPF records, using the form defined
    in\n   that specification:\n   ra=  Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no
    default).  MUST be a\n        local-part (see Section 3.4.1 of [MAIL]) specifying
    an e-mail\n        address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail claiming
    to\n        be from this domain (see Section 2.4 of [SPF] for a description\n
    \       of how domains are identified for SPF checks) has failed the\n        evaluation
    algorithm described in [SPF], in particular because a\n        message arrived
    via an unauthorized route.  To generate a\n        complete address to which the
    report is sent, the Verifier\n        simply appends to this value an \"@\" followed
    by the\n        SPF-compliant domain per Section 4.1 of [SPF].  ra= modifiers
    in\n        a record that was reached by following an \"include\" mechanism\n
    \       (defined in Section 5.2 of [SPF]) MUST be ignored.\n      ABNF:\n      spf-report-tag
    = \"ra=\" qp-section\n   rp=  Requested Report Percentage (plain-text; OPTIONAL;
    default is\n        \"100\").  The value is an integer from 0 to 100 inclusive
    that\n        indicates what percentage of incidents of SPF failures, selected\n
    \       at random, are to cause reports to be generated.  The report\n        generator
    SHOULD NOT issue reports for more than the requested\n        percentage of incidents.
    \ An exception to this might be some\n        out-of-band arrangement between
    two parties to override it with\n        some mutually agreed value.  Report generators
    MAY make use of\n        the \"Incidents:\" field in [ARF] to indicate that there
    are more\n        reportable incidents than there are reports.\n      ABNF:\n
    \     spf-rp-tag = \"rp=\" 1*12DIGIT \"/\" 1*12DIGIT\n   rr=  Requested Reports
    (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is \"all\").  The\n        value MUST be a colon-separated
    list of tokens representing\n        those conditions under which a report is
    desired.  See\n        Section 4.1 for a list of valid tags.\n      ABNF:\n      spf-rr-type
    = ( \"all\" / \"e\" / \"f\" / \"s\" / \"n\" )\n      spf-rr-tag = \"rr=\" spf-rr-type
    *( \":\" spf-rr-type )\n   In the absence of an \"ra=\" tag in the SPF record,
    the \"rp=\" and \"rr=\"\n   tags MUST be ignored, and the report generator MUST
    NOT issue a\n   report.\n"
