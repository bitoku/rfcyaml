  - "1.  Introduction\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] is a network-based\
    \ mobility\n   management protocol standardized by IETF.  One of the key goals\
    \ of\n   the PMIPv6 protocol is to enable a mobile node to perform handovers\n\
    \   across access networks based on different access technologies.  The\n   protocol\
    \ was also designed with the goal to allow a mobile node to\n   simultaneously\
    \ attach to different access networks and perform flow-\n   based access selection\
    \ [RFC7864].  The base protocol features\n   specified in [RFC5213] and [RFC5844]\
    \ have support for these\n   capabilities.  However, to support these features,\
    \ the mobile node is\n   required to be enabled with a specific software configuration\
    \ known\n   as logical-interface support.  The logical-interface configuration\
    \ is\n   essential for a mobile node to perform inter-access handovers without\n\
    \   impacting the IP sessions on the host.\n   A logical-interface construct is\
    \ internal to the operating system.\n   It is an approach of interface abstraction,\
    \ where a logical link-\n   layer implementation hides a variety of physical interfaces\
    \ from the\n   IP stack.  This semantic was used on a variety of operating systems\n\
    \   to implement applications such as Mobile IP client [RFC6275] and\n   IPsec\
    \ VPN client [RFC4301].  Many host operating systems have support\n   for some\
    \ form of such logical-interface construct.  But, there is no\n   specification\
    \ that documents the behavior of these logical interfaces\n   or the requirements\
    \ of a logical interface for supporting the above-\n   mentioned mobility management\
    \ features.  This specification attempts\n   to document these aspects.\n   The\
    \ rest of the document provides a functional description of a\n   logical interface\
    \ on the mobile node and the interworking between a\n   mobile node using a logical\
    \ interface and the network elements in the\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  It\
    \ also analyzes the issues involved with\n   the use of a logical interface and\
    \ characterizes the contexts in\n   which such usage is appropriate.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   All the mobility-related terms used in this document are\
    \ to be\n   interpreted as defined in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications\n \
    \  [RFC5213] and [RFC5844].  In addition, this document uses the\n   following\
    \ terms:\n   PIF (Physical Interface):  A network interface module on the host\n\
    \      that is used for connecting to an access network.  A host\n      typically\
    \ has a number of network interface modules, such as\n      Ethernet, Wireless\
    \ LAN, LTE, etc.  Each of these network\n      interfaces can support specific\
    \ link technology.\n   LIF (Logical Interface):  A virtual interface in the IP\
    \ stack.  A\n      logical interface appears to the IP stack just as any other\n\
    \      physical interface and provides similar semantics with respect to\n   \
    \   packet transmit and receive functions to the upper layers of the\n      IP\
    \ stack.  However, it is only a logical construct and is not a\n      representation\
    \ of an instance of any physical hardware.\n   SIF (Sub-Interface):  A physical\
    \ or logical interface that is part of\n      a logical-interface construct. \
    \ For example, a logical interface\n      may have been created by abstracting\
    \ two physical interfaces, LTE\n      and WLAN.  These physical interfaces, LTE\
    \ and WLAN, are referred\n      to as sub-interfaces of that logical interface.\
    \  In some cases, a\n      sub-interface can also be another logical interface,\
    \ such as an\n      IPsec tunnel interface.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Hiding Link-Layer Technologies -- Approaches and Applicability\n   There\
    \ are several techniques that allow hiding changes in access\n   technology changes\
    \ from the host layer.  These changes in access\n   technology are primarily due\
    \ to the host's movement between access\n   networks.  This section classifies\
    \ these existing techniques into a\n   set of generic approaches, according to\
    \ their most representative\n   characteristics.  Later sections of this document\
    \ analyze the\n   applicability of these solution approaches for supporting features,\n\
    \   such as inter-technology handovers and IP flow mobility support for a\n  \
    \ mobile node.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Link-Layer Abstraction -- Approaches
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Link-Layer Abstraction -- Approaches\n   The following generic mechanisms\
    \ can hide access technology changes\n   from the host IP layer:\n   o  Link-Layer\
    \ Support -- Certain link-layer technologies are able to\n      hide physical\
    \ media changes from the upper layers.  For example,\n      IEEE 802.11 is able\
    \ to seamlessly change between IEEE 802.11a/b/g\n      physical layers.  Also,\
    \ an 802.11 Station (STA) can move between\n      different access points within\
    \ the same domain without the IP\n      stack being aware of the movement.  In\
    \ this case, the IEEE 802.11\n      Media Access Control (MAC) layer takes care\
    \ of the mobility,\n      making the media change invisible to the upper layers.\
    \  Another\n      example is IEEE 802.3, which supports changing the rate from\
    \ 10\n      Mbps to 100 Mbps and to 1000 Mbps.  Another example is the\n     \
    \ situation in the 3GPP Evolved Packet System [TS23401] where the\n      User\
    \ Equipment (UE) can perform inter-access handovers between\n      three different\
    \ access technologies (2G GSM/EDGE Radio Access\n      Network (GERAN), 3G Universal\
    \ Terrestrial Radio Access Network\n      (UTRAN), and 4G Evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN))\
    \ that are invisible to the\n      IP layer at the UE.\n   o  A logical interface\
    \ denotes a mechanism that logically groups\n      several physical interfaces\
    \ so they appear to the IP layer as a\n      single interface (see Figure 1).\
    \  Depending on the type of access\n      technologies, it might be possible to\
    \ use more than one physical\n      interface at a time -- such that the node\
    \ is simultaneously\n      attached via different access technologies -- or just\
    \ perform\n      handovers across a variety of physical interfaces.  Controlling\n\
    \      the way the different access technologies are used (simultaneous,\n   \
    \   sequential attachment, etc.) is not trivial and requires\n      additional\
    \ intelligence and/or configuration within the logical-\n      interface implementation.\
    \  The configuration is typically handled\n      via a connection manager, and\
    \ it is based on a combination of user\n      preferences on one hand and operator\
    \ preferences such as those\n      provisioned by the Access Network Discovery\
    \ and Selection Function\n      (ANDSF) [TS23402] on the other hand.  The IETF\
    \ Interfaces MIB\n      specified in [RFC2863] and the YANG data model for interface\n\
    \      management specified in [RFC7223] treat a logical interface just\n    \
    \  like any other type of network interface on the host.  This\n      essentially\
    \ makes the logical interface a natural operating system\n      construct.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Link-Layer Support
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Link-Layer Support\n   Link-layer mobility support applies to cases in\
    \ which the same link-\n   layer technology is used and mobility can be fully\
    \ handled at that\n   layer.  One example is the case where several 802.11 access\
    \ points\n   are deployed in the same subnet with a common IP-layer configuration\n\
    \   (DHCP server, default router, etc.).  In this case, the handover\n   across\
    \ access points need not be hidden to the IP layer since the IP-\n   layer configuration\
    \ remains the same after a handover.  This type of\n   scenario is applicable\
    \ to cases when the different points of\n   attachment (i.e., access points) belong\
    \ to the same network domain,\n   e.g., enterprise, hotspots from same operator,\
    \ etc.\n   Since this type of link-layer technology does not typically allow for\n\
    \   simultaneous attachment to different access networks of the same\n   technology,\
    \ the logical interface would not be used to provide\n   simultaneous access for\
    \ purposes of multihoming or flow mobility.\n   Instead, the logical interface\
    \ can be used to provide inter-access\n   technology handover between this type\
    \ of link-layer technology and\n   another link-layer technology, e.g., between\
    \ IEEE 802.11 and IEEE\n   802.16.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Logical Interface
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Logical Interface\n   The use of a logical interface allows the mobile\
    \ node to provide a\n   single-interface perspective to the IP layer and its upper\
    \ layers\n   (transport and application).  Doing so allows inter-access technology\n\
    \   handovers or application flow handovers to be hidden across different\n  \
    \ physical interfaces.\n   The logical interface may support simultaneous attachment\
    \ in addition\n   to sequential attachment.  It requires additional support at\
    \ the node\n   and the network in order to benefit from simultaneous attachment.\n\
    \   For example, special mechanisms are required to enable addressing a\n   particular\
    \ interface from the network (e.g., for flow mobility).  In\n   particular, extensions\
    \ to PMIPv6 are required in order to enable the\n   network (i.e., the mobile\
    \ access gateway (MAG) and local mobility\n   anchor (LMA)) to deal with the logical\
    \ interface, instead of using\n   extensions to IP interfaces as currently specified\
    \ in RFC 5213.  RFC\n   5213 assumes that each physical interface capable of attaching\
    \ to a\n   MAG is an IP interface, while the logical-interface solution groups\n\
    \   several physical interfaces under the same IP logical interface.\n   It is\
    \ therefore clear that the logical-interface approach satisfies\n   the requirement\
    \ of multi-access technology and supports both\n   sequential and simultaneous\
    \ access.\n"
- title: 4.  Technology Use Cases
  contents:
  - "4.  Technology Use Cases\n   3GPP has defined the Evolved Packet System (EPS)\
    \ for heterogeneous\n   wireless access.  A mobile device equipped with 3GPP and\
    \ non-3GPP\n   wireless technologies can simultaneously or sequentially connect\
    \ to\n   any of the available access networks and receive IP services through\n\
    \   any of them.  This document focuses on employing a logical interface\n   for\
    \ simultaneous and sequential use of a variety of access\n   technologies.\n \
    \  As mentioned in the previous sections, the logical-interface\n   construct\
    \ is able to hide from the IP layer the specifics of each\n   technology in the\
    \ context of network-based mobility (e.g., in multi-\n   access technology networks\
    \ based on PMIPv6).  The LIF concept can be\n   used with at least the following\
    \ technologies: 3GPP access\n   technologies (3G and LTE), IEEE 802.16 access\
    \ technology, and IEEE\n   802.11 access technology.\n   In some UE implementations,\
    \ the wireless connection setup is based on\n   creation of a PPP interface between\
    \ the IP layer and the wireless\n   modem that is configured with the IP Control\
    \ Protocol (IPCP) and IPv6\n   Control Protocol (IPv6CP) [RFC5072].  In this case,\
    \ the PPP interface\n   does not have any layer 2 (L2) addresses assigned.  In\
    \ some other\n   implementations, the wireless modem is presented to the IP layer\
    \ as a\n   virtual Ethernet interface.\n"
- title: 5.  Logical-Interface Functional Details
  contents:
  - "5.  Logical-Interface Functional Details\n   This section identifies the functional\
    \ details of a logical interface\n   and provides some implementation considerations.\n\
    \   On most operating systems, a network interface is associated with a\n   physical\
    \ device that offers the services for transmitting and\n   receiving IP packets\
    \ from the network.  In some configurations, a\n   network interface can also\
    \ be implemented as a logical interface,\n   which does not have the inherent\

    \      +------+\n              Figure 1: General Overview of Logical Interface\n\
    \   From the perspective of the IP stack and the applications, a logical\n   interface\
    \ is just another interface.  In fact, the logical interface\n   is only visible\
    \ to the IP and upper layers when enabled.  A host does\n   not see any operational\
    \ difference between a logical and a physical\n   interface.  As with physical\
    \ interfaces, a logical interface is\n   represented as a software object to which\
    \ IP address configuration is\n   bound.  However, the logical interface has some\
    \ special properties\n   that are essential for enabling inter-technology handover\
    \ and flow-\n   mobility features.  Following are those properties:\n   1.  The\
    \ logical interface has a relation to a set of physical\n       interfaces (sub-interfaces)\
    \ on the host that it is abstracting.\n       These sub-interfaces can be attached\
    \ or detached from the logical\n       interface at any time.  The sub-interfaces\
    \ attached to a logical\n       interface are not visible to the IP and upper\
    \ layers.\n   2.  The logical interface may be attached to multiple access\n \
    \      technologies.\n   3.  The Transmit/Receive functions of the logical interface\
    \ are\n       mapped to the Transmit/Receive services exposed by the sub-\n  \
    \     interfaces.  This mapping is dynamic, and any change is not\n       visible\
    \ to the upper layers of the IP stack.\n   4.  The logical interface maintains\
    \ IP flow information for each of\n       its sub-interfaces.  A conceptual data\
    \ structure is maintained\n       for this purpose.  The host may populate this\
    \ information based\n       on tracking each of the sub-interfaces for the active\
    \ flows.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Configuration of a Logical Interface
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Configuration of a Logical Interface\n   A host may be statically configured\
    \ with the logical-interface\n   configuration, or an application such as a connection\
    \ manager on the\n   host may dynamically create it.  Furthermore, the set of\
    \ sub-\n   interfaces that are part of a logical-interface construct may be a\n\
    \   fixed set or may be kept dynamic, with the sub-interfaces getting\n   added\
    \ or deleted as needed.  The specific details related to these\n   configuration\
    \ aspects are implementation specific and are outside the\n   scope of this document.\n\
    \   The IP layer should be configured with a default router reachable via\n  \
    \ the logical interface.  The default router can be internal to the\n   logical\
    \ interface, i.e., it is a logical router that in turn decides\n   which physical\
    \ interface is to be used to transmit packets.\n"

  - "5.2.  Logical-Interface Conceptual Data Structures\n   Every logical interface\
    \ maintains a list of sub-interfaces that are\n   part of that logical-interface\

    \ Figure 2 shows an example LIF table\n   where logical interface LIF-1 has three\
    \ sub-interfaces, ETH-0,\n   WLAN-0, and LTE-0, and logical interface LIF-2 has\
    \ two sub-\n   interfaces, ETH-1 and WLAN-1.  For each LIF entry, the table should\n\
    \   store the associated link status and policy associated with that sub-\n  \

    \                           Figure 3: Flow Table\n   The Flow table allows the\
    \ logical interface to properly route each IP\n   flow over a specific sub-interface.\
    \  The logical interface can\n   identify the flows arriving on its sub-interfaces\
    \ and associate them\n   to those sub-interfaces.  This approach is similar to\
    \ reflective QoS\n   performed by the IP routers.  For locally generated traffic\
    \ (e.g.,\n   unicast flows), the logical interface should perform interface\n\
    \   selection based on the Flow Routing Policies.  In case traffic of an\n   existing\
    \ flow is suddenly received from the network on a different\n   sub-interface\
    \ from the one locally stored, the logical interface\n   should interpret the\
    \ event as an explicit flow mobility trigger from\n   the network, and it should\
    \ update the corresponding entry in the Flow\n   table.  Similarly, locally generated\
    \ events from the sub-interfaces\n   or configuration updates to the local policy\
    \ rules can cause updates\n   to the table and hence trigger flow mobility.\n"

- title: 6.3.  Flow Mobility Support
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Flow Mobility Support\n   To support IP flow mobility, there is a need\
    \ to support vertical\n   handoff scenarios such as transferring a subset of a\
    \ prefix(es)\n   (hence the flows associated to it/them) from one interface to\n\
    \   another.  The mobile node can support this scenario by using the\n   logical-interface\
    \ support.  This scenario is similar to the inter-\n   technology handoff scenario\
    \ defined in Section 6.2; only a subset of\n   the prefixes are moved between\
    \ interfaces.\n   Additionally, IP flow mobility in general initiates when the\
    \ LMA\n   decides to move a particular flow from its default path to a\n   different\
    \ one.  The LMA can decide the best MAG to be used to forward\n   a particular\
    \ flow when the flow is initiated (e.g., based on\n   application policy profiles)\
    \ and/or during the lifetime of the flow\n   upon receiving a network-based or\
    \ a mobile-based trigger.  However,\n   the specific details on how the LMA can\
    \ formulate such flow policy is\n   outside the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This specification explains the operational details\
    \ of a logical\n   interface on an IP host.  The logical-interface implementation\
    \ on the\n   host is not visible to the network and does not require any special\n\
    \   security considerations.\n   Different layer 2 interfaces and the access networks\
    \ to which they\n   are connected have different security properties.  For example,\
    \ the\n   layer 2 network security of a Wireless LAN network operated by an end\n\
    \   user is in the control of the home user whereas an LTE operator has\n   control\
    \ of the layer 2 security of the LTE access network.  An\n   external entity using\
    \ lawful means, or through other means, obtains\n   the security keys from the\
    \ LTE operator, but the same may not be\n   possible in the case of a Wireless\
    \ LAN network operated by a home\n   user.  Therefore, grouping interfaces with\
    \ such varying security\n   properties into one logical interface could have negative\n\
    \   consequences in some cases.  Such differences, though subtle, are\n   entirely\
    \ hidden by logical interfaces and are unknown to the upper\n   layers.\n"
