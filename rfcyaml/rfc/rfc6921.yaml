  - "1.  Introduction\n   We are approaching the time when we will be able to communicate\n\
    \   faster than the speed of light.  It is well known that as we approach\n  \
    \ the speed of light, time slows down.  Logically, it is reasonable to\n   assume\
    \ that as we go faster than the speed of light, time will\n   reverse.  The major\
    \ consequence of this for Internet protocols is\n   that packets will arrive before\
    \ they are sent.  This will have a\n   major impact on the way we design Internet\
    \ protocols.  This paper\n   outlines some of the issues and suggests some directions\
    \ for\n   additional analysis of these issues.\n   There is a lot of discussion\
    \ in the physics community about faster-\n   than-light travel and communication.\
    \  In fact, it even has a well\n   known acronym \"FTL\".  This acronym will be\
    \ used in the remainder of\n   this document.\n   FTL issues have been discussed\
    \ in the scientific literature for a\n   long time.  For example, it was discussed\
    \ in 1917 in the section\n   \"Velocities Greater than that of Light\" on page\
    \ 54 of \"The Theory of\n   the Relativity of Motion\" [Tolman].  A good overall\
    \ description of\n   the effects of FTL communication can be found in [Goldberg].\n\
    \   [Ardavan] describes a \"polarization synchrontron\", which pushes radio\n\
    \   waves faster than the speed of light.  In the paper, the author\n   explains:\n\
    \      ...though no superluminal source of electromagnetic fields can be\n   \
    \   point-like, there are no physical principles preventing extended\n      faster-than-light\
    \ sources.  The coordinated motion of aggregates\n      of subluminally-moving\
    \ charged particles can give rise to\n      macroscopic polarization currents\
    \ whose distribution patterns move\n      superluminally.  Further relevant progress\
    \ occurred with the\n      theoretical prediction that extended sources that move\
    \ faster than\n      their own waves could be responsible for the extreme properties\
    \ of\n      both the electromagnetic emission from pulsars (rapidly spinning,\n\
    \      magnetized neutron stars) and the acoustic emission by supersonic\n   \
    \   rotors and propellers.\n   This may be a viable approach for transmitting\
    \ data FTL.\n"
- title: 2.  Protocol Design Considerations for FTL Communication

  - "2.  Protocol Design Considerations for FTL Communication\n   Most, if not all,\
    \ Internet protocols were designed with the basic\n   assumption that the sender\
    \ would transmit the packet before the\n   receiver received it.  For example,\
    \ in the Transmission Control\n   Protocol (TCP) [RFC0793], protocol activity\
    \ is shown in timing\n   diagrams such as Figure 7:\n       TCP A            \
    \                                    TCP B\n   1.  CLOSED                    \
    \                           LISTEN\n   2.  SYN-SENT    --> <SEQ=100><CTL=SYN>\
    \               --> SYN-RECEIVED\n   3.  ESTABLISHED <-- <SEQ=300><ACK=101><CTL=SYN,ACK>\
    \  <-- SYN-RECEIVED\n   4.  ESTABLISHED --> <SEQ=101><ACK=301><CTL=ACK>      \
    \ --> ESTABLISHED\n   5.  ESTABLISHED --> <SEQ=101><ACK=301><CTL=ACK><DATA> -->\
    \ ESTABLISHED\n           Basic 3-Way Handshake for Connection Synchronization\n\
    \                            Figure 7 of RFC 793\n   In an FTL communication environment,\
    \ this assumption is no longer\n   true, because TCP B will receive the first\
    \ SYN before TCP A\n   transmitted it.  For example, the first part of a TCP 3-way\
    \ handshake\n   in an FTL environment will look like:\n       TCP A          \
    \                                      TCP B\n   1.  CLOSED                  \
    \                             LISTEN\n   2.                  <SEQ=100><CTL=SYN>\
    \               --> SYN-RECEIVED\n   3.  SYN-SENT    --> <SEQ=100><CTL=SYN>\n\
    \   The exact operation will depend on the difference between the\n   backward\
    \ time (i.e., from the future to the past) and the processing\n   time to process\
    \ a packet.  If the processing time is greater than the\n   backward time shift,\
    \ then even though the packets are received out of\n   order, TCP should still\
    \ work due to the TCP symmetrical 3-way\n   handshake mechanism.  If the processing\
    \ time is smaller than the\n   backward time shift, then it gets much harder,\
    \ as many packets will\n   be received before they are sent.  The faster the communication\
    \ is\n   above the speed of light, the more severe the problem becomes.\n   Assuming\
    \ the first case where the processing time is equivalent or\n   larger than the\
    \ backward time shift (i.e., after an exchange of\n   packets the backward time\
    \ offset is canceled out), the TCP 3-way\n   handshake in an FTL environment would\
    \ look like:\n       TCP A                                                TCP\
    \ B\n   1.  CLOSED                                               LISTEN\n   2.\
    \                  <SEQ=100><CTL=SYN>               --> SYN-RECEIVED\n   3.  SYN-SENT\
    \    --> <SEQ=100><CTL=SYN>\n   4.  ESTABLISHED <-- <SEQ=300><ACK=101><CTL=SYN,ACK>\
    \      SYN-RECEIVED\n   5.  ESTABLISHED     <SEQ=300><ACK=101><CTL=SYN,ACK>  <--\
    \ SYN-RECEIVED\n   6.  ESTABLISHED     <SEQ=101><ACK=301><CTL=ACK>      --> ESTABLISHED\n\
    \   7.  ESTABLISHED --> <SEQ=101><ACK=301><CTL=ACK>          ESTABLISHED\n   It\
    \ shows remarkable forethought by the inventors of the TCP protocol\n   that the\
    \ 3-way handshake works in an FTL communication environment.\n   This is due to\
    \ the symmetrical nature of the 3-way handshake and its\n   ability to deal with\
    \ dropped packets.  It should be possible to use\n   dropped packets as a way\
    \ to mimic an FTL communication environment.\n   In fact, this may provide a good\
    \ vehicle to analyze and test\n   protocols to see how they will work in an FTL\
    \ communication\n   environment.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Related Issues
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Related Issues\n   Additional work is needed to think about protocol design\n\
    \   considerations when the backward time shift is much greater than the\n   processing\
    \ time.  This would create challenges where it would be\n   necessary to have\
    \ received all of the data before the connection\n   could be established.  This\
    \ is left to future researchers.  In\n   practical terms, this scenario isn't\
    \ likely to happen for a long\n   time.  That said, FTL communication might lead\
    \ to FTL travel, where\n   we can travel into the past.  It may be necessary to\
    \ start working on\n   this yesterday.\n   There is a large amount of work that\
    \ has been done in a related area,\n   Delay-Tolerant Networks.  For example,\
    \ [RFC4838] defines an\n   architecture for Delay-Tolerant Networks.  An FTL communication\n\
    \   environment is similar to Delay-Tolerant Networks with the major\n   difference\
    \ that the packets arrive at the destination with a negative\n   delay.  Documents\
    \ that will need review include \"A One-way Delay\n   Metric for IPPM\" [RFC2679]\
    \ and \"A Delay Bound alternative revision of\n   RFC 2598\" [RFC3248].\n   Congestion\
    \ control algorithms will also need serious review --\n   specifically, how to\
    \ handle negative round-trip time (RTT) on TCP\n   congestion control or the corner\
    \ case where the RTT comes out at\n   exactly zero.  Do any of the control equations\
    \ include a divide-by-\n   RTT or sqrt(RTT)?  It should also be noted that there\
    \ may be the\n   possibility for significant advancements in congestion algorithms\n\
    \   given the properties of FTL communication.  Specifically, it maybe\n   possible\
    \ to stop network congestion before it starts.  This could be\n   an important\
    \ new approach for congestion control researchers.\n"
- title: 3.  FTL Communication Research
  contents:
  - "3.  FTL Communication Research\n   FTL communication has great potential for\
    \ the networking research\n   community.  It is clearly an exciting area for new\
    \ research and\n   considerable time could be spent working on it.  It is very\
    \ important\n   that we fully understand all of its aspects before we know how\
    \ to\n   achieve FTL communication.  Funding agencies should take this into\n\
    \   account when allocating money and make sure that all new research\n   projects\
    \ look at FTL communication environments.\n"
- title: 4.  IETF Recommendations
  contents:
  - "4.  IETF Recommendations\n   The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG),\
    \ which is the part of\n   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that manages\
    \ the standards\n   process, has area reviews as part of its review process. \
    \ For\n   example, the Security area reviews proposed protocols for security\n\
    \   issues.  The IETF Chair also has a General area that does overall\n   reviews.\n\
    \   The author recommends that the IETF create a new review group to\n   evaluate\
    \ all new Internet protocols to verify that FTL communication\n   has been taken\
    \ into consideration in the design of the protocol.\n   This would be similar\
    \ to what is done to make sure that new Internet\n   protocols are secure or are\
    \ designed to run over IPv4 and IPv6.  As\n   we look forward to FTL communication,\
    \ it is critical that all\n   Internet protocols are designed to work in this\
    \ environment.\n   Further, the author recommends that the IESG start a review\
    \ process\n   to do a detailed analysis of all existing Internet protocols to\
    \ make\n   sure they have been designed to work in FTL communication\n   environments.\
    \  For protocols that do not work in this environment,\n   the IESG should add\
    \ work items to exiting working group charters or\n   charter new working groups\
    \ to update these protocols so that they\n   will work in FTL communication environments.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   It is early to fully understand security issues\
    \ relating to FTL\n   communication.  The main issue is likely to be related to\
    \ the\n   characteristic of FTL communication that the receiver will receive a\n\
    \   packet before it is sent.  Many exploits are likely to be written to\n   take\
    \ advantage of this property.  Also, given the number of exploits\n   that are\
    \ being discovered that don't have any protections available,\n   it may be that\
    \ the malware community is already taking advantage of\n   the properties of FTL\
    \ communication.\n"
