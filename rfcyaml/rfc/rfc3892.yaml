    \  mechanism where one party (the referrer) gives a second party (the\n   referee)
    an arbitrary URI to reference.  If that URI is a SIP URI,\n   the referee will

    document extends the REFER method, allowing\n   the referrer to provide information
    about the REFER request to the\n   refer target using the referee as an intermediary.
    \ This information\n   includes the identity of the referrer and the URI to which
    the\n   referrer referred.  The mechanism utilizes S/MIME to help protect\n   this
    information from a malicious intermediary.  This protection is\n   optional, but
    a recipient may refuse to accept a request unless it is\n   present.\n"

  - "1.  Overview\n   The SIP REFER method [2] provides a mechanism where one party
    (the\n   referrer) provides a second party (the referee) with an arbitrary URI\n
    \  to reference.  If that URI is a SIP URI, the referee will send a SIP\n   request,
    often an INVITE, to that URI (the refer target).  Nothing\n   provided in [2]
    distinguishes this referenced request from any other\n   request the referee might
    have sent to the refer target.\n      Referrer           Referee            Refer

    INVITE target      |\n         |                  |------------------->|\n   There
    are applications of REFER, such as call transfer [8], where it\n   is desirable
    to provide the refer target with particular information\n   about the referrer
    and the REFER request itself.  This information\n   may include, but is not limited
    to, the referrer's identity, the\n   referred to URI, and the time of the referral.
    \ The refer target can\n   use this information when deciding whether to admit
    the referenced\n   request.  This document defines one set of mechanisms to provide
    that\n   information.\n   All of the mechanisms in this document involve placing
    information in\n   the REFER request that the referee copies into the referenced\n
    \  request.  This necessarily establishes the referee as an eavesdropper\n   and
    places the referee in a position to launch man-in-the-middle\n   attacks on that
    information.\n   At the simplest level, this document defines a mechanism for
    carrying\n   the referrer's identity, expressed as a SIP URI in a new header:\n
    \  Referred-By.  The refer target can use that information, even if it\n   has
    not been protected from the referee, at the perils and with the\n   limitations
    documented here.  The document proceeds to define an\n   S/MIME based mechanism
    for expressing the identity of the referrer\n   and capturing other information
    about the REFER request, allowing the\n   refer target to detect tampering (and
    other undesirable behaviors) by\n   the referee.\n"

  - "3.  The Referred-By Header Field\n   Referred-By is a request header field as
    defined by [5].  It can\n   appear in any request.  It carries a SIP URI representing
    the\n   identity of the referrer and, optionally, the Content-ID of a body\n   part
    (the Referred-By token) that provides a more secure statement of\n   that identity.\n
    \     Referred-By  =  (\"Referred-By\" / \"b\") HCOLON referrer-uri\n                     *(
    SEMI (referredby-id-param / generic-param) )\n      referrer-uri = ( name-addr
    / addr-spec )\n      referredby-id-param = \"cid\" EQUAL sip-clean-msg-id\n      sip-clean-msg-id
    = LDQUOT dot-atom \"@\" (dot-atom / host) RDQUOT\n      dot-atom = atom *( \".\"

    / \"+\" / \"'\" / \"`\" / \"~\"   )\n   Since the Content-ID appears as a SIP
    header parameter value which\n   must conform to the expansion of the gen-value
    defined in [5], this\n   grammar produces values in the intersection of the expansions
    of\n   gen-value and msg-id from [9].  The double-quotes surrounding the\n   sip-clean-msg-id
    MUST be replaced with left and right angle brackets\n   to derive the Content-ID
    used in the message's MIME body.  For\n   example,\n      Referred-By: sip:r@ref.example;cid=\"2UWQFN309shb3@ref.example\"\n
    \        indicates the token is in the body part containing\n           Content-ID:
    <2UWQFN309shb3@ref.example>\n   If the referrer-uri contains a comma, question
    mark, or semicolon,\n   (for example, if it contains URI parameters) the URI MUST
    be enclosed\n   in angle brackets (< and >). Any URI parameters are contained
    within\n   these brackets. If the URI is not enclosed in angle brackets, any\n
    \  semicolon-delimited parameters are header-parameters, not URI\n   parameters.\n
    \  The Referred-By header field MAY appear in any SIP request, but is\n   meaningless
    for ACK and CANCEL.  Proxies do not need to be able to\n   read Referred-By header
    field values and MUST NOT remove or modify\n   them.\n   The following row should

    Body as defined by\n   [3].  This body part MUST be identified with a MIME [6]

    copies of the\n   Refer-To, Referred-By, and Date header fields from the REFER
    request.\n   The token SHOULD NOT contain the Call-ID header field from the REFER\n
    \  request as that information is not useful to the refer target and may\n   even
    be an information leak.  The token SHOULD NOT contain the From\n   header field
    from the REFER request since the identity being claimed\n   is represented in
    the Referred-By header field.\n   The token MAY contain the To header field from
    the REFER request, but\n   it SHOULD NOT be included unless the referrer has cryptographically\n
    \  identified the referee.  Some ways this authentication can be\n   achieved
    include inspecting the certificates used in a TLS\n   association between the
    referrer and the referee or encrypting the\n   Refer-To header in the REFER request
    using the S/MIME encryption\n   techniques detailed in [5].\n   When inspecting
    the certificates used to establish TLS associations,\n   the identity asserted
    in the token's To header field URI is compared\n   to the subjectAltNames from
    the referee's certificate.  The sip and\n   sips URI schemes MUST be treated as
    equivalent for this comparison.\n   If the URI is an exact match, confidence in
    the authentication is\n   high and the To header field MAY be added to the token.
    \ If the\n   certificate subjects contain only a hostname matching the hostname\n
    \  portion of the URI, an application level warning SHOULD be issued to\n   the
    referrer agent's user seeking that user's consent before\n   including the To
    header field in the token.\n   Including the To header field in the token significantly
    strengthens\n   the claim being asserted by the token, but may have privacy\n
    \  implications as discussed in Section 6.1.\n   Additional header fields and
    body parts MAY be included in the token.\n   As described in [3], a Referred-By
    token MAY be encrypted as well as\n   signed.  The subjectAltName of the certificate

      invalid.\n   A target SHOULD verify that the request it receives matches the\n

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The mechanism defined in this specification relies
    on an intermediary\n   (the referee) to forward information from the referrer
    to the refer\n   target.  This necessarily establishes the referee as an eavesdropper\n
    \  of that information and positions him perfectly to launch man-in-\n   the-middle
    attacks using the mechanism.\n   A SIP proxy is similarly positioned.  Protecting
    SIP messaging from\n   malicious proxy implementations is discussed in [5].  In
    contrast to\n   a proxy,  the referee's agent is an endpoint.  Proxies will typically\n
    \  be managed and monitored by service providers.  Malicious behavior by\n   a
    proxy is more likely to be noticed and result in negative\n   repercussions for
    the provider than malicious behavior by an endpoint\n   would be.  The behavior
    of an endpoint can be entirely under the\n   control of a single user.  Thus,
    it is more feasible for an endpoint\n   acting as referee to behave maliciously
    than it is for a proxy being\n   operated by a service provider.\n   This specification
    uses an S/MIME based mechanism to enable the refer\n   target to detect manipulation
    of the Referred-By information by the\n   referee.  Use of this protection is
    optional!  The community has\n   asserted that there are systems where trust in
    the validity of this\n   information is either not important or can be established
    through\n   other means.  Any implementation choosing not to use this optional\n
    \  mechanism needs to provide its own defense to the following risks:\n   o  The
    Referred-By information is highly likely to influence request\n      admission
    policy.  For instance, it may be displayed to the user\n      of the agent with
    a \"This call was transferred to you by X.\n      Accept?\" prompt.  A malicious
    referee can unduly influence that\n      policy decision by providing falsified
    referred-by information.\n      This includes falsely claiming to have been referred
    in the first\n      place.  (The S/MIME mechanism protects the information with
    a\n      signature, hampering the referee's ability to inject or modify\n      information
    without knowing the key used for that signature.)\n   o  A referee is by definition
    an eavesdropper of the referred-by\n      information.  Parts of that information
    may be sensitive.  (The\n      S/MIME mechanism allows encryption.)\n   o  The
    referee may store any referred-by information it sees and\n      paste it into
    future unrelated requests.  (The S/MIME mechanism\n      allows detection of stale
    assertions by covering a timestamp with\n      the signature and allows detection
    of use in unrelated requests by\n      covering the Refer-To header field with
    the signature.)\n   The mechanisms in this specification do NOT prevent the referee
    from\n   deleting ALL referred-by information from the referenced request.  A\n
    \  refer target can not detect such deletion.  This introduces no new\n   problems
    since removing all referred-by information from a referenced\n   request transforms
    it into an ordinary SIP request as described in\n   [5].  Thus the referee gains
    no new influence over processing logic\n   at the refer target by removing the
    referred-by information.\n   Refer targets can protect themselves from the possibility
    of a\n   malicious referee removing a token (leaving an unsecured identity in\n
    \  the Referred-By header field) by using the 429 error response.\n   Applications
    using the mechanisms in this document may be able to\n   take advantage of pre-existing
    relationships between the participants\n   to mitigate the risks of its use.  In
    some transfer scenarios, A has\n   the choice of referring B to C or referring
    C to B.  If A and B have\n   a pre-existing trust relationship, leading A to have
    greater\n   confidence that B will not behave maliciously (B is A's\n   administrative
    assistant for example), referring B to C may make more\n   sense.\n   This mechanism
    involves two SIP requests between three endpoints, the\n   REFER and the referenced
    request.  The content of those messages\n   (including the referred-by information)
    is subject to the security\n   considerations and protection mechanisms documented
    in [5].\n   Proxies between the participants may collect referred-by information\n
    \  and re-insert it in future requests or make it available to hostile\n   endpoints.
    \ The end-to-end confidentiality capabilities discussed in\n   [5] can help reduce
    the risk of exposing sensitive referred-by\n   information to these proxies.  The
    abuse possibilities in subsequent\n   requests by proxies (or endpoints that they
    may leak information to)\n   between the referee and the refer target are identical
    to the abuse\n   by the referee, and the considerations discussed for a malicious\n
    \  referee applies.  The abuse possibilities in subsequent requests by\n   proxies
    (or endpoints that they may leak information to) between the\n   referrer and
    the referee are similar to those discussed for the\n   presentation of Authenticated
    Identity Bodies in [7].\n"

    - "6.1.  Identifying the Referee in the Referred-by Token\n   To a refer target,
      a Referred-By token minimally asserts \"The\n   identity expressed by this Referred-By
      header field asked at the time\n   indicated in this Date header field that
      the request indicated by\n   this Refer-To header field be sent\".  This assertion
      makes no claims\n   at all about who is being asked to send the request.  This
      is\n   sufficient to enable policies such as \"Accept any requests referred\n
      \  by Alice\", but not \"Only accept requests from Bob if he can prove\n   that
      Alice referred him to us\".  Thus, there is an opportunity for a\n   cut-and-paste
      attack.  If Mallory sees Alice refer Carol to us using\n   a minimal token,
      he can copy that token into his own request (as long\n   as it matches what
      is indicated in the embedded Refer-To header), and\n   it will appear to us
      that Alice referred Mallory to us.  This risk is\n   best mitigated by protecting
      the REFER Alice sends to Carol from\n   eavesdropping, using TLS or the S/MIME
      mechanisms detailed in [5].\n   Including the To header field from the REFER
      request in the\n   Referred-by token enables the \"Only accept requests from
      Bob if he\n   can prove that Alice referred him to us\".  Alice is constrained
      to\n   add this header to the token only if she is sure she is sending the\n
      \  REFER request to Bob.  We, in turn, ensure it was Bob that sent the\n   referenced
      request to us, in addition to validating Alice's signature\n   of the token.
      \ Mallory's earlier attack is not effective with this\n   token.\n   Including
      the To header field in the Referred-By token has privacy\n   implications, however.
      \ Carol, above, might wish to contact us\n   anonymously.  That wish would be
      defeated if Carol's identity\n   appeared in the token Alice created.  If Alice
      encrypted the token to\n   us, Carol will not even be aware of the information
      leak.  To protect\n   herself when she wishes anonymity, Carol will have to
      reject any\n   REFER requests containing a Referred-By token she can not inspect.\n"
