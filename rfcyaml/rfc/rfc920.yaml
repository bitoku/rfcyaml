  - "Status of this Memo\n   This memo is a policy statement on the requirements of\
    \ establishing a\n   new domain in the ARPA-Internet and the DARPA research community.\n\
    \   This is an official policy statement of the IAB and the DARPA.\n   Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This memo restates and refines the requirements on establishing\
    \ a\n   Domain first described in RFC-881 [1].  It adds considerable detail\n\
    \   to that discussion, and introduces the limited set of top level\n   domains.\n"
- title: The Purpose of Domains
  contents:
  - "The Purpose of Domains\n   Domains are administrative entities.  The purpose\
    \ and expected use of\n   domains is to divide the name management required of\
    \ a central\n   administration and assign it to sub-administrations.  There are\
    \ no\n   geographical, topological, or technological constraints on a domain.\n\
    \   The hosts in a domain need not have common hardware or software, nor\n   even\
    \ common protocols.  Most of the requirements and limitations on\n   domains are\
    \ designed to ensure responsible administration.\n   The domain system is a tree-structured\
    \ global name space that has a\n   few top level domains.  The top level domains\
    \ are subdivided into\n   second level domains.  The second level domains may\
    \ be subdivided\n   into third level domains, and so on.\n   The administration\
    \ of a domain requires controlling the assignment of\n   names within that domain\
    \ and providing access to the names and name\n   related information (such as\
    \ addresses) to users both inside and\n   outside the domain.\n"

  - "General Purpose Domains\n   While the initial domain name \"ARPA\" arises from\
    \ the history of the\n   development of this system and environment, in the future\
    \ most of the\n   top level names will be very general categories like \"government\"\
    ,\n   \"education\", or \"commercial\".  The motivation is to provide an\n   organization\
    \ name that is free of undesirable semantics.\n   After a short period of initial\
    \ experimentation, all current\n   ARPA-Internet hosts will select some domain\
    \ other than ARPA for their\n   future use.  The use of ARPA as a top level domain\

  - "Domain Requirements\n      If a host in a given domain somehow misbehaves in\
    \ its interactions\n      with hosts outside the domain (e.g., consistently violates\n\
    \      protocols), the responsible person for the domain must be\n      competent\
    \ and available to receive reports of problems, take\n      action on the reported\
    \ problems, and follow through to eliminate\n      the problems.\n   Domain Servers:\n\
    \      A robust and reliable domain server must be provided.  One way of\n   \
    \   meeting this requirement is to provide at least two independent\n      domain\
    \ servers for the domain.  The database can, of course, be\n      the same.  The\
    \ database can be prepared and copied to each domain\n      server.  But, the\
    \ servers should be in separate machines on\n      independent power supplies,\
    \ et cetera; basically as physically\n      independent as can be.  They should\
    \ have no common point of\n      failure.\n      Some domains may find that providing\
    \ a robust domain service can\n      most easily be done by cooperating with another\
    \ domain where each\n      domain provides an additional server for the other.\n\
    \      In other situations, it may be desirable for a domain to arrange\n    \
    \  for domain service to be provided by a third party, perhaps on\n      hosts\
    \ located outside the domain.\n      One of the difficult problems in operating\
    \ a domain server is the\n      acquisition and maintenance of the data.  In this\
    \ case, the data\n      are the host names and addresses.  In some environments\
    \ this\n      information changes fairly rapidly and keeping up-to-date data may\n\
    \      be difficult.  This is one motivation for sub-domains.  One may\n     \
    \ wish to create sub-domains until the rate of change of the data in\n      a\
    \ sub-domain domain server database is easily managed.\n      In the technical\
    \ language of the domain server implementation the\n      data is divided into\
    \ zones.  Domains and zones are not necessarily\n      one-to-one.  It may be\
    \ reasonable for two or more domains to\n      combine their data in a single\
    \ zone.\n      The responsible person or an identified technical assistant must\n\
    \      understand in detail the procedures for operating a domain server,\n  \
    \    including the management of master files and zones.\n      The operation\
    \ of a domain server should not be taken on lightly.\n      There are some difficult\
    \ problems in providing an adequate\n      service, primarily the problems in\
    \ keeping the database up to\n      date, and keeping the service operating.\n"

  - "Domain Requirements\n      The concepts and implementation details of the domain\
    \ server are\n      given in RFC-882 [2] and RFC-883 [3].\n   Minimum Size:\n\
    \      The domain must be of at least a minimum size.  There is no\n      requirement\
    \ to form a domain because some set of hosts is above\n      the minimum size.\n\
    \      Top level domains must be specially authorized.  In general, they\n   \
    \   will only be authorized for domains expected to have over 500\n      hosts.\n\
    \      The general guideline for a second level domain is that it have\n     \
    \ over 50 hosts.  This is a very soft \"requirement\".  It makes sense\n     \
    \ that any major organization, such as a university or corporation,\n      be\
    \ allowed as a second level domain -- even if it has just a few\n      hosts.\n\
    \   Registration:\n      Top level domains must be specially authorized and registered\
    \ with\n      the NIC domain registrar.\n      The administrator of a level N\
    \ domain must register with the\n      registrar (or responsible person) of the\
    \ level N-1 domain.  This\n      upper level authority must be satisfied that\
    \ the requirements are\n      met before authorization for the domain is granted.\n\
    \      The registration procedure involves answering specific questions\n    \
    \  about the prospective domain.  A prototype of what the NIC Domain\n      Registrar\
    \ may ask for the registration of a second level domain is\n      shown below.\
    \  These questions may change from time to time.  It is\n      the responsibility\
    \ of domain administrators to keep this\n      information current.\n      The\
    \ administrator of a domain is required to make sure that host\n      and sub-domain\
    \ names within that jurisdiction conform to the\n      standard name conventions\
    \ and are unique within that domain.\n      If sub-domains are set up, the administrator\
    \ may wish to pass\n      along some of his authority and responsibility to a\
    \ sub-domain\n      administrator.  Even if sub-domains are established, the\n\
    \      responsible person for the top-level domain is ultimately\n      responsible\

  - "Domain Requirements\n   administrator of a domain may decide which hosts to accept\
    \ into his\n   domain.  Thus the owner of a host and a domain administrator must\n\
    \   come to an understanding about the host being in the domain.  This is\n  \
    \ the foundation of responsible administration.\n      For example, a host \"\
    XYZ\" at MIT might possible be considered as a\n      candidate for becoming any\
    \ of XYZ.ARPA.ORG, XYZ.CSNET, or\n      XYZ.MIT.EDU.\n         The owner of host\
    \ XYZ may choose which domain to join,\n         depending on which domain administrators\
    \ are willing to have\n         him.\n   The domain is part of the host name.\
    \  Thus if USC-ISIA.ARPA changes\n   its domain affiliation to DDN.MIL to become\
    \ USC-ISIA.DDN.MIL, it has\n   changed its name.  This means that any previous\
    \ references to\n   USC-ISIA.ARPA are now out of date.  Such old references may\
    \ include\n   private host name to address tables, and any recorded information\n\
    \   about mailboxes such as mailing lists, the headers of old messages,\n   printed\
    \ directories, and peoples' memories.\n   The experience of the DARPA community\
    \ suggests that changing the name\n   of a host is somewhat painful.  It is recommended\
    \ that careful\n   thought be given to choosing a new name for a host - which\
    \ includes\n   selecting its place in the domain hierarchy.\n"

  - "The Roles of the Network Information Center\n   The NIC plays two types of roles\
    \ in the administration of domains.\n   First,  the NIC is the registrar of all\
    \ top level domains.  Second\n   the NIC is the administrator of several top level\
    \ domains (and the\n   registrar for second level domains in these).\n   Top Level\
    \ Domain Registrar\n      As the registrar for top level domains, the NIC is the\
    \ contact\n      point for investigating the possibility of establishing a new\
    \ top\n      level domain.\n   Top Level Domain Administrator\n      For the top\
    \ level domains designated so far, the NIC is the\n      administrator of each\
    \ of these domains.  This means the NIC is\n      responsible for the management\
    \ of these domains and the\n      registration of the second level domains or\
    \ hosts (if at the\n      second level) in these domains.\n"
