- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating\n\
    \   documented examples to deployed systems, an IPv6 unicast address\n   prefix\
    \ is reserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation,\n   and the like.\
    \  Since site-local and link-local unicast addresses have\n   special meaning\
    \ in IPv6, these addresses cannot be used in many\n   example situations.  The\
    \ document describes the use of the IPv6\n   address prefix 2001:DB8::/32 as a\
    \ reserved prefix for use in\n   documentation.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The address architecture for IPv6 [1] does not specifically\
    \ allocate\n   an IPv6 address prefix for use for documentation purposes.\n  \
    \ Documentation material is currently using address prefixes drawn from\n   address\
    \ blocks already allocated or assigned to existing\n   organizations or to well\
    \ known ISPs, or drawn from the currently\n   unallocated address pool.  Such\
    \ use conflicts with existing or future\n   allocations or assignments of IPv6\
    \ address space.\n   The problems such conflicts may cause have already been encountered\n\
    \   with IPv4 where literal use of documented examples in a production\n   environment\
    \ causes address and routing conflicts with existing\n   services.  In making\
    \ an explicit allocation of a documentation\n   address prefix, it is intended\
    \ that such operational problems may be\n   avoided for IPv6.\n   Similar, but\
    \ different, discussion also applies to top level domain\n   names and some have\
    \ been reserved for similar purposes [2].\n"
- title: 2.  Documentation IPv6 Address Prefix
  contents:
  - "2.  Documentation IPv6 Address Prefix\n   To allow documentation to accurately\
    \ describe deployment examples,\n   the use of site local or link local addresses\
    \ is inappropriate, and a\n   unicast address block is required.  All IPv6 unicast\
    \ address space is\n   currently marked as reserved, unassigned or has been assigned\
    \ to the\n   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for further redistribution\n\
    \   to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) [1], but no unicast\n   address\
    \ space has been specifically nominated for the purposes of use\n   in documented\
    \ examples.\n   Following acceptance within the Asia Pacific regional addressing\n\
    \   community of a proposal for a block of IPv6 address space to be\n   reserved\
    \ for documentation purposes, the Asia Pacific Network\n   Information Centre\
    \ (APNIC) allocated a unicast address prefix for\n   documentation purposes. \
    \ The address block is within the range of a\n   conventional allocation size,\
    \ so that documentation can accurately\n   match deployment scenarios.\n   The\
    \ documentation prefix described in this memo can also be used to\n   generate\
    \ multicast addresses for documentation, using the Unicast\n   prefix-based proposal\
    \ [3].  Representing other kinds of multicast\n   addresses in documentation is\
    \ outside the scope of this memo.\n   The prefix allocated for documentation purposes\
    \ is 2001:DB8::/32\n"
- title: 3.  Operational Implications
  contents:
  - "3.  Operational Implications\n   This assignment implies that IPv6 network operators\
    \ should add this\n   address prefix to the list of non-routeable IPv6 address\
    \ space, and\n   if packet filters are deployed, then this address prefix should\
    \ be\n   added to packet filters.\n   This is not a local-use address prefix,\
    \ and the filters may be used\n   in both local and public contexts.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA is to record the allocation of the IPv6 global\
    \ unicast address\n   prefix  2001:DB8::/32 as a documentation-only prefix  in\
    \ the IPv6\n   address registry.  No end party is to be assigned this address.\n"

    \ impact on Internet\n   infrastructure security.\n"
