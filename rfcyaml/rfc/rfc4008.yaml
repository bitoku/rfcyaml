  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for devices implementing NAT function.  This MIB module may be\
    \ used\n   for configuration and monitoring of a device capable of NAT function.\n\
    \   NAT types and their characteristics are defined in[RFC2663].\n   Traditional\
    \ NAT function, in particular is defined in [RFC3022].\n   This MIB does not address\
    \ the firewall functions and must not be used\n   for configuring or monitoring\
    \ these.  Section 2 provides references\n   to the SNMP management framework,\
    \ which was used as the basis for the\n   MIB module definition.  Section 3 describes\
    \ the terms used throughout\n   the document.  Section 4 provides an overview\
    \ of the key objects,\n   their inter-relationship, and how the MIB module may\
    \ be used to\n   configure and monitor a NAT device.  Lastly, section 5 has the\n\
    \   complete NAT MIB definition.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"

  - "2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\

    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\

- title: 3.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "3.  Terminology\n   Definitions for a majority of the terms used throughout the\
    \ document\n   may be found in RFC 2663 [RFC2663].  Additional terms that further\n\
    \   classify NAPT implementations are defined in RFC 3489 [RFC3489].\n   Listed\
    \ below are terms used in this document.\n   Address realm - An address realm\
    \ is a realm of unique network\n   addresses that are routable within the realm.\
    \  For example, an\n   enterprise address realm could be constituted of private\
    \ IP addresses\n   in the ranges specified in RFC 1918 [RFC1918], which are routable\n\
    \   within the enterprise, but not across the Internet.  A public realm\n   is\
    \ constituted of globally unique network addresses.\n   Symmetric NAT - Symmetric\
    \ NAT, as defined in RFC 3489 [RFC3489], is a\n   variation of Network Address\
    \ Port Translator (NAPT).  Symmetric NAT\n   does not use port bind for translation\
    \ across all sessions\n   originating from the same private host.  Instead, it\
    \ assigns a new\n   public port to each new session, irrespective of whether the\
    \ new\n   session used the same private end-point as before.\n   Bind or Binding\
    \ - Several variations of the term 'Bind' (or\n   'Binding') are used throughout\
    \ the document.  Address Bind (or\n   Address Binding) is a tuple of (Private\
    \ IP address, Public IP\n   Address) used for translating an IP address end-point\
    \ in IP packets.\n   Port Bind (or, Port Binding, or Address Port Bind, or Address\
    \ Port\n   Binding) is a tuple of (transport protocol, Private IP address,\n \
    \  Private port, Public IP Address, Public port) used for translating a\n   port\
    \ end-point tuple of (transport protocol, IP address, port).  Bind\n   is used\
    \ to refer to either Address Bind or Port Bind.  Bind Mode\n   identifies whether\
    \ a bind is Address Bind or Port Bind.\n   NAT Session - A NAT session is an association\
    \ between a session as\n   seen in the private realm and a session as seen in\
    \ the public realm,\n   by virtue of NAT translation.  If a session in the private\
    \ realm were\n   to be represented as (PrivateSrcAddr, PrivateDstAddr,\n   TransportProtocol,\
    \ PrivateSrcPort, PrivateDstPort) and the same\n   session in the public realm\
    \ were to be represented as (PublicSrcAddr,\n   PublicDstAddr, TransportProtocol,\
    \ PublicSrcPort, PublicDstPort), the\n   NAT session will provide the translation\
    \ glue between the two session\n   representations.  NAT sessions in the document\
    \ are restricted to\n   sessions based on TCP and UDP only.  In the future, NAT\
    \ sessions may\n   be extended to be based on other transport protocols such as\
    \ SCTP,\n   UDP-lite and DCCP.\n   The terms 'local' and 'private' are used interchangeably\
    \ throughout\n   the document when referring to private networks, IP addresses,\
    \ and\n   ports.  Likewise, the terms 'global' and 'public' are used\n   interchangeably\
    \ when referring to public networks, IP addresses, and\n   ports.\n"
- title: 4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview\n   NAT MIB is configurable on a per-interface basis and depends\
    \ in\n   several parts on the IF-MIB [RFC2863].\n   NAT MIB requires that an interface\
    \ for which NAT is configured be\n   connected to either a private or a public\
    \ realm.  The realm\n   association of the interface plays an important role in\
    \ the\n   definition of address maps for the interface.  An address map entry\n\
    \   identifies the orientation of the session (inbound or outbound to the\n  \
    \ interface) for which the entry may be used for NAT translation.  The\n   address\
    \ map entry also identifies the end-point of the session that\n   must be subject\
    \ to translation.  An SNMP Textual-Convention\n   'NatTranslationEntity' is defined\
    \ to capture this important\n   characteristic that combines session orientation\
    \ and applicable\n   session endpoint for translation.\n   An address map may\
    \ consist of static or dynamic entries.  NAT creates\n   static binds from a static\
    \ address map entry.  Each static bind has a\n   direct one-to-one relationship\
    \ with a static address map entry.  NAT\n   creates dynamic binds from a dynamic\
    \ address map entry upon seeing\n   the first packet of a new session.\n   The\
    \ following subsections define the key objects used in NAT MIB,\n   their inter-relationship,\
    \ and how to configure a NAT device using the\n   MIB module.\n"
- title: 4.1.  natInterfaceTable
  contents:
  - "4.1.  natInterfaceTable\n   natInterfaceTable is defined in the MIB module to\
    \ configure interface\n   specific realm type and the NAT services enabled for\
    \ the interface.\n   natInterfaceTable is indexed by ifIndex and also includes\
    \ interface\n   specific NAT statistics.\n   The first step for an operator in\
    \ configuring a NAT device is\n   determining the interface over which NAT service\
    \ is to be configured.\n   When NAT service is operational, translated packets\
    \ traverse the NAT\n   device by ingressing on a private interface and egressing\
    \ on a public\n   interface or vice versa.  An operator may configure the NAT\
    \ service\n   on either the public interface or the private interface in the\n\
    \   traversal path.\n   As the next step, the operator must identify the NAT service(s)\n\
    \   desired for the interface.  The operator may configure one or more\n   NAT\
    \ services on the same interface.  The MIB module identifies four\n   types of\
    \ NAT services: Basic NAT, NAPT, twice NAT and bidirectional\n   NAT.  These are\
    \ NAT varieties as defined in RFC 2663 [RFC2663].  Note\n   that RFC 3489 [RFC3489]\
    \ further classifies NAPT implementations based\n   on the behavior exhibited\
    \ by the NAPT devices from different vendors.\n   However, the MIB module does\
    \ not explicitly distinguish between the\n   NAPT implementations.  NAPT implementations\
    \ may be distinguished\n   between one another by monitoring the BIND and NAT\
    \ Session objects\n   generated by the NAT device as described in section 4.6.\n"
- title: 4.2.  natAddrMapTable
  contents:
  - "4.2.  natAddrMapTable\n   natAddrMapTable is defined in the MIB module to configure\
    \ address\n   maps on a per-interface basis.  natAddrMapTable is indexed by the\n\
    \   tuple of (ifIndex, natAddrMapIndex).  The same table is also used to\n   collect\
    \ Statistics for the address map entries.  Address maps are key\n   to NAT configuration.\
    \  An operator may configure one or more address\n   map entries per interface.\
    \  NAT looks up address map entries in the\n   order in which they are defined\
    \ to determine the translation function\n   at the start of each new session traversing\
    \ the interface.  An\n   address map may consist of static or dynamic entries.\
    \  A static\n   address map entry has a direct one-to-one relationship with binds.\n\
    \   NAT will dynamically create binds from a dynamic address map entry.\n   The\
    \ operator must be careful in selecting address map entries for an\n   interface\
    \ based on the interface realm-type and the type of NAT\n   service desired. \
    \ The operator can be amiss in the selection of\n   address map entries when not\
    \ paying attention to the associated\n   interface characteristics defined in\
    \ natInterfaceTable (described in\n   section 4.1).  For example, say the operator\
    \ wishes to configure a\n   NAPT map entry on an interface of a NAT device.  If\
    \ the operator\n   chooses to configure the NAPT map entry on a public interface\
    \ (i.e.,\n   interface realm-type is public), the operator should set the\n  \
    \ TranslationEntity of the NAPT address map entry to be\n   outboundSrcEndPoint.\
    \  On the other hand, if the operator chooses to\n   configure the NAPT map entry\
    \ on a private interface (i.e., interface\n   realm-type is private), the operator\
    \ should set the TranslationEntity\n   of the NAPT address map entry to be InboundSrcEndPoint.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3.  Default Timeouts, Protocol Table, and Other Scalars\n   DefTimeouts is\
    \ defined in the MIB module to configure idle Bind\n   timeout and IP protocol\
    \ specific idle NAT session timeouts.  The\n   timeouts defined are global to\
    \ the system and are not interface\n   specific.\n   Protocol specific statistics\
    \ are maintained in natProtocolTable,\n   which is indexed by the protocol type.\n\
    \   The scalars natAddrBindNumberOfEntries and\n   natAddrPortBindNumberOfEntries\
    \ hold the number of entries that\n   currently exist in the Address Bind and\
    \ the Address Port Bind tables,\n   respectively.\n   The generation of natPacketDiscard\
    \ notifications can be configured by\n   using the natNotifThrottlingInterval\
    \ scalar MIB object.\n"
- title: 4.4.  natAddrBindTable and natAddrPortBindTable
  contents:
  - "4.4.  natAddrBindTable and natAddrPortBindTable\n   Two Bind tables, natAddrBindTable\
    \ and natAddrPortBindTable, are\n   defined to hold the bind entries.  Entries\
    \ are derived from the\n   address map table and are not configurable.  natAddrBindTable\n\
    \   contains Address Binds, and natAddrPortBindTable contains Address\n   Port\
    \ Binds.  natAddrBindTable is indexed by the tuple of (ifIndex,\n   LocalAddrType,\
    \ LocalAddr).  natAddrPortBindTable is indexed by the\n   tuple of (ifIndex, LocalAddrType,\
    \ LocalAddr, LocalPort, Protocol).\n   These tables also maintain bind specific\
    \ statistics.  A Symmetric NAT\n   will have no entries in the Bind tables.\n"
- title: 4.5.  natSessionTable
  contents:
  - "4.5.  natSessionTable\n   natSessionTable is defined to hold NAT session entries.\
    \  NAT session\n   entries are derived from NAT Binds (except in the case of Symmetric\n\
    \   NAT) and are not configurable.\n   The NAT session provides the necessary\
    \ translation glue between two\n   session representations of the same end-to-end\
    \ session; that is, a\n   session as seen in the private realm and in the public\
    \ realm.\n   Session orientation (inbound or outbound) is determined from the\n\
    \   orientation of the first packet traversing the NAT interface.\n   Address\
    \ map entries and bind entries on the interface determine\n   whether a session\
    \ is subject to NAT translation.  One or both\n   endpoints of a session may be\
    \ subject to translation.\n   With the exception of symmetric NAT, all other NAT\
    \ functions use\n   end-point specific bind to perform individual end-point translations.\n\
    \   Multiple NAT sessions would use the same bind as long as they share\n   the\
    \ same endpoint.  Symmetric NAT does not retain a consistent port\n   bind across\
    \ multiple sessions using the same endpoint.  For this\n   reason, the bind identifier\
    \ for a NAT session in symmetric NAT is set\n   to zero.  natSessionTable is indexed\
    \ by the tuple of (ifIndex,\n   natSessionIndex).  Statistics for NAT sessions\
    \ are also maintained in\n   the same table.\n"
- title: 4.6.  RFC 3489 NAPT Variations, NAT Session and Bind Tables
  contents:
  - "4.6.  RFC 3489 NAPT Variations, NAT Session and Bind Tables\n   [RFC3489] defines\
    \ four variations of NAPT - Full Cone, Restricted\n   Cone, Port Restricted Cone,\
    \ and Symmetric NAT.  These can be\n   differentiated in the NAT MIB based on\
    \ different values for the\n   objects in the session and the bind tables, as\
    \ indicated below.\n   In a Port Restricted Cone NAT, NAT Session objects will\
    \ contain a\n   non-zero PrivateSrcEPBindId object.  Further, all address and\
    \ port\n   objects within a NAT session will have non-zero values (i.e., no\n\
    \   wildcard matches).\n   An Address Restricted Cone NAT may have been implemented\
    \ in the same\n   way as a Port Restricted Cone NAT, except that the UDP NAT Sessions\n\
    \   may use ANY match on PrivateDstPort and PublicDstPort objects; i.e.,\n   PrivateDstPort\
    \ and PublicDstPort objects within a NAT session may be\n   set to zero.\n   A\
    \ Full Cone NAT may have also been implemented in the same way as a\n   Port Restricted\
    \ Cone NAT, except that the UDP NAT Sessions may use\n   ANY match on PrivateDstAddr,\
    \ PrivateDstPort, PublicDstAddr, and\n   PublicDstPort objects.  Within a NAT\
    \ Session, all four of these\n   objects may be set to zero.  Alternately, all\
    \ address and port\n   objects within a NAT Session may have non-zero values,\
    \ yet the\n   TranslationEntity of the PrivateSrcEPBindId for the NAT Sessions\
    \ may\n   be set bi-directionally, i.e., as a bit mask of (outboundSrcEndPoint\n\
    \   and inboundDstEndPoint) or (inboundSrcEndPoint and\n   outboundDstEndPoint),\
    \ depending on the interface realm type.  Lastly,\n   a Symmetric NAT does not\
    \ maintain Port Bindings.  As such, the NAT\n   Session objects will have the\
    \ PrivateSrcEPBindId set to zero.\n"

- title: 4.9.  Configuration via the MIB
  contents:
  - "4.9.  Configuration via the MIB\n   Sections 4.1 and 4.2 and part of section\
    \ 4.3 refer to objects that\n   are configurable on a NAT device.  NAT derives\
    \ Address Bind and\n   Address Port Bind entries from the Address Map table. \
    \ Hence, an\n   Address Bind or an Address Port Bind entry must not exist without\
    \ an\n   associated entry in the Address Map table.\n   Further, NAT derives NAT\
    \ session entries from NAT Binds, except in\n   the case of symmetric NAT, which\
    \ derives translation parameters for a\n   NAT session directly from an address\
    \ map entry.  Hence, with the\n   exception of Symmetric NAT, a NAT session entry\
    \ must not exist in the\n   NAT Session table without a corresponding bind.\n\
    \   A Management station may use the following steps to configure entries\n  \
    \ in the NAT-MIB:\n   -  Create an entry in the natInterfaceTable specifying the\
    \ value of\n      ifIndex as the interface index of the interface on which NAT\
    \ is\n      being configured.  Specify appropriate values, as applicable, for\n\
    \      the other objects (e.g., natInterfaceRealm,\n      natInterfaceServiceType)\
    \ in the table (refer to Section 4.1).\n   -  Create one or more address map entries\
    \ sequentially in reduced\n      order of priority in the natAddrMapTable, specifying\
    \ the value of\n      ifIndex to be the same for all entries.  The ifIndex specified\n\
    \      would be the same as that specified for natInterfaceTable (refer\n    \
    \  to Section 4.2).\n   -  Configure the maximum permitted idle time duration\

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   It is clear that this MIB can potentially be\
    \ useful for\n   configuration.  Unauthorized access to the write-able objects\
    \ could\n   cause a denial of service and/or widespread network disturbance.\n\
    \   Hence, the support for SET operations in a non-secure environment\n   without\
    \ proper protection can have a negative effect on network\n   operations.\n  \
    \ At this writing, no security holes have been identified beyond those\n   that\
    \ SNMP Security is itself intended to address.  These relate\n   primarily to\
    \ controlled access to sensitive information and the\n   ability to configure\
    \ a device - or which might result from operator\n   error, which is beyond the\
    \ scope of any security architecture.\n   There are a number of managed objects\
    \ in this MIB that may contain\n   information that may be sensitive from a business\
    \ perspective, in\n   that they may represent NAT bind and session information.\
    \  The NAT\n   bind and session objects reveal the identity of private hosts that\n\
    \   are engaged in a session with external end nodes.  A curious outsider\n  \
    \ could monitor these two objects to assess the number of private hosts\n   being\
    \ supported by the NAT device.  Further, a disgruntled former\n   employee of\
    \ an enterprise could use the NAT bind and session\n   information to break into\
    \ specific private hosts by intercepting the\n   existing sessions or originating\
    \ new sessions into the host.  There\n   are no objects that are sensitive in\
    \ their own right, such as\n   passwords or monetary amounts.  It may even be\
    \ important to control\n   GET access to these objects and possibly to encrypt\
    \ the values of\n   these objects when they are sent over the network via SNMP.\
    \  Not all\n   versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.\n\
    \   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even\
    \ if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then,\
    \ there is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access\
    \ and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB.\n   It\
    \ is recommended that the implementers consider the security\n   features as provided\
    \ by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section\n   8), including full support\
    \ for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms\n   (for authentication and privacy).\n\
    \   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.\
    \  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic\
    \ security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to ensure that\
    \ the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module is properly\
    \ configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals (users)\
    \ that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
