- title: 4. Motivation for the Option
  contents:
  - "4. Motivation for the Option\n   This option allows a telnet server to determine\
    \ the type of terminal\n   connected to a user telnet program.  The transmission\
    \ of such\n   information does not immediately imply any change of processing.\n\
    \   However, the information may be passed to a process, which may alter\n   the\
    \ data it sends to suit the particular characteristics of the\n   terminal. For\
    \ example, some operating systems have a terminal driver\n   that accepts a code\
    \ indicating the type of terminal being driven.\n   Using the TERMINAL TYPE and\
    \ BINARY options, a telnet server program\n   on such a system could arrange to\
    \ have terminals driven as if they\n   were directly connected, including such\
    \ special functions as cursor\n   addressing, multiple colors, etc., not included\
    \ in the Network\n   Virtual Terminal specification.  This option fits into the\
    \ normal\n   structure of TELNET options by deferring the actual transfer of\n\
    \   status information to the SB command.\n"
- title: 5. Description of the Option
  contents:
  - "5. Description of the Option\n   WILL and DO are used only to obtain and grant\
    \ permission for future\n   discussion. The actual exchange of status information\
    \ occurs within\n   option subcommands (IAC SB TERMINAL-TYPE...).\n   Once the\
    \ two hosts have exchanged a WILL and a DO, the sender of the\n   WILL TERMINAL-TYPE\
    \ is free to transmit type information, spontan-\n   eously or in response to\
    \ a request from the sender of the DO.  At\n   worst, this may lead to transmitting\
    \ the information twice. Only the\n   sender of the DO may send requests (IAC\
    \ SB TERMINAL-TYPE SEND IAC SE)\n   and only the sender of the WILL may transmit\
    \ actual type information\n   (within an IAC SB TERMINAL-TYPE IS ... IAC SE command).\n\
    \   The terminal type information is an NVT ASCII string.  Within this\n   string,\
    \ upper and lower case are considered equivalent.  A few\n   terminal type names\
    \ useful in the context of IBM systems are listed\n   below.  It is anticipated\
    \ that additional names will be added in the\n   future.  The complete list of\
    \ valid terminal types will be found in\n   the latest \"Assigned Numbers\" RFC.\n"

    \ The following is an example of use of the option:\n      Host1: IAC DO TERMINAL-TYPE\n\
    \      Host2: IAC WILL TERMINAL-TYPE\n         (Host2 is now free to send status\
    \ information at any time.\n         Solicitations from Host1 are NOT necessary.\
    \ This should not\n         produce any dangerous race conditions. At worst, two\
    \ IS's will\n         be sent.)\n      Host1 (perhaps): IAC SB TERMINAL-TYPE SEND\

- title: 6.  Implementation Suggestions
  contents:
  - "6.  Implementation Suggestions\n   The \"terminal type\" information may be any\
    \ NVT ASCII string meaning-\n   ful to both ends of the negotiation.  The list\
    \ of suggestions below\n   is intended to minimize confusion caused by alternative\
    \ \"spellings\"\n   of the terminal type.  For example, confusion would arise\
    \ if one\n   party were to call a terminal \"IBM3278-2\" while the other called\
    \ it\n   \"IBM-3278/2\".  There is no negative acknowledgement for a terminal\n\
    \   type that is not understood, but certain other options (such as\n   switching\
    \ to BINARY mode) may be refused if a valid terminal type\n   name has not been\
    \ specified.  In some cases, a particular terminal\n   may be known by more than\
    \ one name, for example a specific type and a\n   more generic type.  In such\
    \ cases, the sender of the TERMINAL-TYPE IS\n   command should reply to successive\
    \ TERMINAL-TYPE SEND commands with\n   the various names, from most to least specific.\
    \  In this way, a\n   telnet server that does not understand the first response\
    \ can prompt\n   for alternatives.  However, it should cease sending TERMINAL-TYPE\n\
    \   SEND commands after receiving the same response two consecutive\n   times.\
    \  Similarly, a sender should indicate it has sent all available\n   names by\
    \ repeating the last one sent.\n   Here are a few terminal types useful in the\
    \ IBM environment:\n      IBM-3275-2\n      IBM-3276-2\n      IBM-3276-3\n   \
