  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5440] describes Path Computation Element Communication
    Protocol\n   (PCEP) for communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC)
    and\n   a PCE or between a pair of PCEs as per [RFC4655].  A PCE computes\n   paths
    for MPLS-TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs) based on various\n   constraints and optimization
    criteria.\n   Stateful PCE [RFC8231] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to\n
    \  enable stateful control of paths such as MPLS-TE LSPs between and\n   across
    PCEP sessions in compliance with [RFC4657].  It includes\n   mechanisms to affect
    LSP state synchronization between PCCs and PCEs,\n   delegation of control of
    LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and\n   sequence of path computations
    within and across PCEP sessions.  The\n   focus is on a model where LSPs are configured
    on the PCC, and control\n   over them is delegated to the stateful PCE.  Furthermore,
    [RFC8281]\n   specifies a mechanism to dynamically instantiate LSPs on a PCC based\n
    \  on the requests from a stateful PCE or a controller using stateful\n   PCE.\n
    \  Path protection [RFC4427] refers to a paradigm in which the working\n   LSP
    is protected by one or more protection LSP(s).  When the working\n   LSP fails,
    protection LSP(s) is/are activated.  When the working LSPs\n   are computed and
    controlled by the PCE, there is benefit in a mode of\n   operation where protection
    LSPs are also computed and controlled by\n   the same PCE.  [RFC8051] describes
    the applicability of path\n   protection in PCE deployments.\n   This document
    specifies a stateful PCEP extension to associate two or\n   more LSPs for the
    purpose of setting up path protection.  The\n   extension defined in this document
    covers the following scenarios:\n   *  A PCC initiates a protection LSP and retains
    the control of the\n      LSP.  The PCC computes the path itself or makes a request
    for path\n      computation to a PCE.  After the path setup, it reports the\n
    \     information and state of the path to the PCE.  This includes the\n      association
    group identifying the working and protection LSPs.\n      This is the passive
    stateful mode [RFC8051].\n   *  A PCC initiates a protection LSP and delegates
    the control of the\n      LSP to a stateful PCE.  During delegation, the association
    group\n      identifying the working and protection LSPs is included.  The PCE\n
    \     computes the path for the protection LSP and updates the PCC with\n      the
    information about the path as long as it controls the LSP.\n      This is the
    active stateful mode [RFC8051].\n   *  A protection LSP could be initiated by
    a stateful PCE, which\n      retains the control of the LSP.  The PCE is responsible
    for\n      computing the path of the LSP and updating to the PCC with the\n      information
    about the path.  This is the PCE-Initiated mode\n      [RFC8281].\n   Note that
    a protection LSP can be established (signaled) before the\n   failure (in which
    case the LSP is said to be either in standby mode\n   [RFC4427] or a primary LSP
    [RFC4872]) or after failure of the\n   corresponding working LSP (known as a secondary
    LSP [RFC4872]).\n   Whether to establish it before or after failure is according
    to\n   operator choice or policy.\n   [RFC8697] introduces a generic mechanism
    to create a grouping of\n   LSPs, which can then be used to define associations
    between a set of\n   LSPs.  The mechanism is equally applicable to stateful PCE
    (active\n   and passive modes) and stateless PCE.\n   This document specifies
    a PCEP extension to associate one working LSP\n   with one or more protection
    LSPs using the generic association\n   mechanism.\n   This document describes
    a PCEP extension to associate protection LSPs\n   by creating the Path Protection
    Association Group (PPAG) and encoding\n   this association in PCEP messages for
    stateful PCEP sessions.\n"

      by listing the other LSPs\n   with which they interact but, rather, by making
      them belong to an\n   association group.  All LSPs join an association group
      individually.\n   The generic ASSOCIATION object is used to associate two or
      more LSPs\n   as specified in [RFC8697].  This document defines a new Association\n
      \  type called \"Path Protection Association Type\" of value 1 and a \"Path\n
      \  Protection Association Group\" (PPAG).  A member LSP of a PPAG can\n   take
      the role of working or protection LSP.  A PPAG can have one\n   working LSP
      and/or one or more protection LSPs.  The source,\n   destination, Tunnel ID
      (as carried in LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV [RFC8231],\n   with description as per [RFC3209]),
      and Protection Type (PT) (in Path\n   Protection Association TLV) of all LSPs
      within a PPAG MUST be the\n   same.  As per [RFC3209], a TE tunnel is used to
      associate a set of\n   LSPs during reroute or to spread a traffic trunk over
      multiple paths.\n   The format of the ASSOCIATION object used for PPAG is specified
      in\n   [RFC8697].\n   [RFC8697] specifies the mechanism for the capability advertisement
      of\n   the Association types supported by a PCEP speaker by defining an\n   ASSOC-Type-List
      TLV to be carried within an OPEN object.  This\n   capability exchange for the
      Association type described in this\n   document (i.e., Path Protection Association
      Type) MAY be done before\n   using this association, i.e., the PCEP speaker
      MAY include the Path\n   Protection Association Type (1) in the ASSOC-Type-List
      TLV before\n   using the PPAG in the PCEP messages.\n   This Association type
      is dynamic in nature and created by the PCC or\n   PCE for the LSPs belonging
      to the same TE tunnel (as described in\n   [RFC3209]) originating at the same
      head node and terminating at the\n   same destination.  These associations are
      conveyed via PCEP messages\n   to the PCEP peer.  As per [RFC8697], the association
      source is set to\n   the local PCEP speaker address that created the association
      unless\n   local policy dictates otherwise.  Operator-configured Association\n
      \  Range MUST NOT be set for this Association type and MUST be ignored.\n"

      a PCEP speaker attempts to add or update an LSP\n   to a PPAG and the Tunnel
      ID (as carried in the LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV\n   [RFC8231], with a description
      as per [RFC3209]) or source or\n   destination of the LSP is different from

      send PCErr with Error-Type 26 (Association Error)\n   [RFC8697] and Error-Value
      11 (Protection type is not supported).\n   A given LSP MAY belong to more than

      the protection type is set to 1+1 (i.e., protection type=0x08 or\n   0x10),
      there MUST be at maximum only one working LSP and one\n   protection LSP within

      Protection Association).\n   During the make-before-break (MBB) procedure, two
      paths will briefly\n   coexist.  The error handling related to the number of

  - "5.  Other Considerations\n   The working and protection LSPs are typically resource
    disjoint\n   (e.g., node, Shared Risk Link Group [SRLG] disjoint).  This ensures\n
    \  that a single failure will not affect both the working and protection\n   LSPs.
    \ The disjoint requirement for a group of LSPs is handled via\n   another Association
    type called \"Disjointness Association\" as\n   described in [PCEP-LSP-EXT].  The
    diversity requirements for the\n   protection LSP are also handled by including
    both ASSOCIATION objects\n   identifying both the protection association group

    and mechanisms to support the\n   association of one LSP to another LSP across
    different RSVP Traffic\n   Engineering (RSVP-TE) sessions using the ASSOCIATION
    and PROTECTION\n   object.  The information in the Path Protection Association
    TLV in\n   PCEP as received from the PCE is used to trigger the signaling of the\n

    [RFC8281], and\n   [RFC5440] apply to the extensions described in this document
    as well.\n   Additional considerations related to associations where a malicious\n
    \  PCEP speaker could be spoofed and could be used as an attack vector\n   by
    creating associations are described in [RFC8697].  Adding a\n   spurious protection
    LSP to the Path Protection Association group\n   could give a false sense of network
    reliability, which leads to\n   issues when the working LSP is down and the protection
    LSP fails as\n   well.  Thus, securing the PCEP session using Transport Layer
    Security\n   (TLS) [RFC8253], as per the recommendations and best current\n   practices
    in BCP 195 [RFC7525], is RECOMMENDED.\n"
