  - "these are:\n      a) The \"information separators\" (transaction type B4) which\
    \ are\n      available in both \"transparent block\" transfers and \"descriptor\n\
    \      and counts\" transfers, and\n      b) The \"sequence numbers\" which can\
    \ be used with the \"descriptor\n      and counts\" transfer mode.\n   After some\
    \ discussion, we seemed to agree that the \"information\n   separators\" (as they\
    \ would be used in \"transparent block\" transfer\n   mode, i.e., without \"sequence\
    \ numbers\") were unlikely to serve as\n   UNAMBIGUOUS restart location marker,\
    \ and therefore we suggest the use\n   of \"sequence numbers\" as markers.  We\
    \ were aware of the fact that\n   this choice might exclude TIPs and other Hosts\
    \ which do not use\n   sequence numbering from the type of recovery under discussion;\
    \ we\n   believe, however, that our suggestion eliminates at least some of\n \
    \  this problem.\n   Imagine that some site, which we will call the \"user site\"\
    \ or \"user\",\n   has initiated a connection from its own file transfer process\
    \ to a\n   file transfer process at some other site, which we will call the\n\
    \   \"server site\" or \"server\".  After the appropriate exchanges of\n   information,\
    \ a file transfer (using the File Transfer Protocol)\n   begins over the path\
    \ between these two sites.  After some information\n   is transferred, the path\
    \ between the user and server is broken.  At\n   some later time the user initiates\
    \ a new connection between the file\n   transfer processes at user and server,\
    \ establishes relevant access\n   privileges, and wishes to resume the transmission\
    \ which was in\n   progress when the path was broken.  First we describe four\
    \ new op-\n   codes for the File Transfer Protocol:\n   Hex        Operation\n\
    \   ---        ---------\n   10         Append at sequence number\n          \
    \    This command is essentially the same as any of the \"Store\"\n          \
    \    or \"Append...\" commands except that a 16-bit sequence\n              number\
    \ immediately follows the op-code (before the\n              pathname).\n   11\
    \         Retrieve at sequence number\n              This is the same as the \"\
    Retrieve\"command except that a\n              16-bit sequence number immediately\
    \ follows the op-code\n              (before the pathname).\n   12         Resume\
    \ Retrieve\n              To be used when the user wishes the server to choose\
    \ the\n              sequence number; in other respects this is identical to\n\
    \              the \"Retrieve\" command.\n   13         Use the sequence number\n\
    \              This command contains only the op-code and a 16-bit\n         \
    \     sequence number.  It is intended as a denial of the\n              ability\
    \ to locate the sequence number given in an \"Append\n              at sequence\
    \ number\" or \"Retrieve at sequence number\"\n              command and, simultaneously,\
    \ to suggest another number\n              which can be located.\n   There are\
    \ several possible cases which are shown below.  The user\n   site is always presumed\

    \ care about the exact sequence number (for\n   example, if the user site is sending\
    \ the file to a printer, some\n   duplicate pages are probably acceptable and\
