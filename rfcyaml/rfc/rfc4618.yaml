    \  The PW terminates at a logical port within the PE, defined at point B\n   in
    the above diagram.  This port provides an HDLC Native Service\n   Processing function
    that will deliver each PPP/HDLC packet that is\n   received at point A, unaltered,
    to the point A in the corresponding\n   PE at the other end of the PW.\n   The
    Native Service Processing (NSP) function includes packet\n   processing that is
    required for the PPP/HDLC packets that are\n   forwarded to the PW termination
    point.  Such functions may include\n   bit stuffing, PW-PW bridging, L2 encapsulation,
    shaping, and\n   policing.  These functions are specific to the native packet\n
    \  technology and may not be required for the PW emulation service.\n   The points
    to the left of B, including the physical layer between the\n   CE and PE, and
    any adaptation (NSP) functions between it and the PW\n   terminations, are outside
    of the scope of PWE3 and are not defined\n   here.\n   \"PW Termination\", between
    A and B, represents the operations for\n   setting up and maintaining the PW,
    and for encapsulating and\n   decapsulating the PPP/HDLC packets as necessary
    to transmit them\n   across the MPLS network.\n"
  title: 2.  Specification of Requirements
- contents:
  - "3.  Applicability Statement\n   PPP/HDLC transport over PW service is not intended
    to emulate the\n   traditional PPP or HDLC service perfectly, but it can be used
    for\n   some applications that require PPP or HDLC transport service.\n   The
    applicability statements in [RFC4619] also apply to the Frame\n   Relay port mode
    PW described in this document.\n   The following are notable differences between
    traditional PPP/HDLC\n   service, and the protocol described in this document:\n
    \  - Packet ordering can be preserved using the OPTIONAL sequence field\n     in
    the control word; however, implementations are not required to\n     support this
    feature.\n   - The Quality of Service model for traditional PPP/HDLC links can
    be\n     emulated, however this is outside the scope of this document.\n   - A
    Frame Relay Port mode PW, or HDLC PW, does not process any frame\n     relay status
    messages or alarms as described in [Q922] [Q933].\n   - The HDLC Flags are processed
    locally in the PE connected to the\n     attachment circuit.\n   The HDLC mode
    is suitable for port-to-port transport of Frame Relay\n   User Network Interface
    (UNI) or Network Node Interface (NNI) traffic.\n   Since all packets are passed
    in a largely transparent manner over the\n   HDLC PW, any protocol that has HDLC-like
    framing may use the HDLC PW\n   mode, including PPP, Frame-Relay, and X.25.  Exceptions
    include cases\n   where direct access to the HDLC interface is required, or modes
    that\n   operate on the flags, Frame Check Sequence (FCS), or bit/byte\n   unstuffing
    that is performed before sending the HDLC PDU over the PW.\n   An example of this
    is PPP Asynchronous-Control-Character-Map (ACCM)\n   negotiation.\n   For PPP,
    since media-specific framing is not carried, the following\n   options will not
    operate correctly if the PPP peers attempt to\n   negotiate them:\n   - Frame
    Check Sequence (FCS) Alternatives\n   - Address-and-Control-Field-Compression
    (ACFC)\n   - Asynchronous-Control-Character-Map (ACCM)\n   Note, also, that PW
    LSP Interface MTU negotiation, as specified in\n   [RFC4447], is not affected
    by PPP Maximum Receive Unit (MRU)\n   advertisement.  Thus, if a PPP peer sends
    a PDU with a length in\n   excess of that negotiated for the PW tunnel, that PDU
    will be\n   discarded by the ingress router.\n"

    \    Figure 3.  General format for PPP/HDLC encapsulation over PSNs\n   The PSN
    Transport Header depends on the particular tunneling\n   technology in use.  This
    header is used to transport the encapsulated\n   PPP/HDLC information through
    the packet-switched core.\n   The Pseudowire Header identifies a particular PPP/HDLC
    service on a\n   tunnel.  In case the of MPLS, the Pseudowire Header is the MPLS
    label\n   at the bottom of the MPLS label stack.\n   The Control Word is inserted
    before the PPP/HDLC service payload.  It\n   may contain a length and sequence
    number.\n"
  - contents:
    - "4.1.  The Control Word\n   There are four requirements that may need to be
      satisfied when\n   transporting layer 2 protocols over an MPLS PSN:\n   i.    Sequentiality
      may need to be preserved.\n   ii.   Small packets may need to be padded in order
      to be transmitted\n         on a medium where the minimum transport unit is
      larger than the\n         actual packet size.\n   iii.  Control bits carried
      in the header of the layer 2 packet may\n         need to be transported.\n
      \  iv.   Creating an in-band associated channel for operation and\n         maintenance
      communications.\n   The Control Word defined in this section is based on the
      Generic PW\n   MPLS Control Word, as defined in [RFC4385].  It provides the
      ability\n   to sequence individual packets on the PW and avoidance of equal-cost\n
      \  multiple-path load-balancing (ECMP) [RFC2992] and enables Operations\n   and
      Management (OAM) mechanisms, including [VCCV].\n   [RFC4385] states, \"If a
      PW is sensitive to packet mis-ordering and is\n   being carried over an MPLS
      PSN that uses the contents of the MPLS\n   payload to select the ECMP path,
      it MUST employ a mechanism which\n   prevents packet mis-ordering.\"  This is
      necessary because ECMP\n   implementations may examine the first nibble after
      the MPLS label\n   stack to determine whether the content of the labeled packet
      is IP.\n   Thus, if the PPP protocol number of a PPP packet carried over the
      PW\n   without a control word present begins with 0x4 or 0x6, it could be\n
      \  mistaken for an IPv4 or IPv6 packet.  This could, depending on the\n   configuration
      and topology of the MPLS network, lead to a situation\n   where all packets
      for a given PW do not follow the same path.  This\n   may increase out-of-order
      packets on a given PW or cause OAM packets\n   to follow a different path from
      that of actual traffic.\n   The features that the control word provides may
      not be needed for a\n   given PPP/HDLC PW.  For example, ECMP may not be present
      or active on\n   a given MPLS network, and strict packet sequencing may not
      be\n   required.  If this is the case, the control word provides little\n   value
      and is therefore optional.  Early PPP/HDLC PW implementations\n   have been
      deployed that do not include a control word or the ability\n   to process one
      if present.  To aid in backwards compatibility, future\n   implementations MUST
      be able to send and receive packets without the\n   control word.\n   In all
      cases, the egress PE MUST be aware of whether the ingress PE\n   will send a
      control word over a specific PW.  This may be achieved by\n   configuration
      of the PEs, or by signaling, as defined in [RFC4447].\n   The control word is
      defined as follows:\n    0                   1                   2                   3\n

      the first 4 bits are set to 0 in indicate a CW\n   [RFC4385].\n   The next 4
      bits provide space for carrying protocol-specific flags.\n   These are not used
      for HDLC/PPP, and they MUST be set to 0 for\n   transmitting and MUST be ignored
      upon receipt.\n   The next 2 bits are defined in [RFC4623].\n   The next 6 bits
      provide a length field, which is used as follows: If\n   the packet's length
      (defined as the length of the layer 2 payload\n   plus the length of the control
      word) is less than 64 bytes, the\n   length field MUST be set to the packet's
      length.  Otherwise, the\n   length field MUST be set to zero.  The value of
      the length field, if\n   not zero, is used to remove any padding that may have
      been added by\n   the MPLS network.  If the control word is used and padding
      was added\n   to the packet in transit on the MPLS network, then when the packet\n
      \  reaches the egress PE the padding MUST be removed before forwarding\n   the
      packet.\n   The next 16 bits provide a sequence number that can be used to\n
      \  guarantee ordered packet delivery.  The processing of the sequence\n   number
      field is OPTIONAL.[RFC4385]\n   The sequence number space is a 16-bit, unsigned
      circular space.  The\n   sequence number value 0 is used to indicate an unsequenced\n
      \  packet.[RFC4385]\n   The procedures described in Section 4 of [RFC4385] MUST
      be followed\n   to process the sequence number field.\n"

    - "4.2.  MTU Requirements\n   The network MUST be configured with an MTU that
      is sufficient to\n   transport the largest encapsulation packets.  When MPLS
      is used as\n   the tunneling protocol, for example, this is likely to be 12
      or more\n   bytes greater than the largest packet size.  The methodology\n   described
      in [RFC4623] MAY be used to fragment encapsulated packets\n   that exceed the
      PSN MTU.  However, if [RFC4623] is not used, then if\n   the ingress router
      determines that an encapsulated layer 2 PDU\n   exceeds the MTU of the PSN tunnel
      through which it must be sent, the\n   PDU MUST be dropped.\n   If a packet
      is received on the attachment circuit that exceeds the\n   interface MTU subTLV
      value [RFC4447], it MUST be dropped.  It is also\n   RECOMMENDED that PPP devices
      be configured to not negotiate PPP MRUs\n   larger than that of the AC MTU.\n"

      FR VCs\n           Figure 5b.  Pseudowires replacing the FR interface\n   FR
      VCs are not visible individually to a PE; there is no\n   configuration of individual
      FR VC in a PE.  A PE processes the set of\n   FR VCs assigned to a port as an
      aggregate.\n   FR port mode provides transport between two PEs of a complete
      FR\n   frame using the same encapsulation as described above for HDLC mode.\n
      \  Although frame relay port mode shares the same encapsulation as HDLC\n   mode,
      a different PW type is allocated in [RFC4446]: 0x000F Frame-\n   Relay Port
      mode.\n   All other aspects of this PW type are identical to the HDLC PW\n   encapsulation
      described above.\n"

    - "5.3.  PPP\n   PPP mode provides point-to-point transport of PPP-encapsulated\n
      \  traffic, as specified in [RFC1661].  The PPP PDU is transported in\n   its
      entirety, including the protocol field (whether compressed using\n   Protocol
      Field Compression or not), but excluding any media-specific\n   framing information,
      such as HDLC address and control fields or FCS.\n   If the OPTIONAL control
      word is used, then the flag bits in the\n   control word are not used and MUST
      be set to 0 for transmitting and\n   MUST be ignored upon receipt.\n   When
      the PE detects a status change in the attachment circuit (AC)\n   status, such
      as an attachment circuit physical link failure, or if\n   the AC is administratively
      disabled, the PE MUST send the appropriate\n   PW status notification message
      that corresponds to the PPP AC status.\n   Note that PPP negotiation status
      is transparent to the PW and MUST\n   NOT be communicated to the remote MPLS
      PE.  In a similar manner, the\n   local PW status MUST also be reflected in
      a respective PW status\n   notification message, as described in [RFC4447].\n
      \  A PW of type 0x0007 \"PPP\" will be used to transport PPP packets.\n   The
      IANA allocation registry of \"Pseudowire Type\" is defined in the\n   IANA allocation
      document for PWs [RFC4446] along with initial\n   allocated values.\n"

  - "6.  Using an MPLS Label as the Demultiplexer Field\n   To use an MPLS label as
    the demultiplexer field, a 32-bit label stack\n   entry [RFC3032] is simply prepended
    to the emulated PW encapsulation\n   and thus appears as the bottom label of an
    MPLS label stack.  This\n   label may be called the \"PW label\".  The particular
    emulated PW\n   identified by a particular label value must be agreed by the ingress\n
    \  and egress LSRs, either by signaling (e.g., via the methods of\n   [RFC4447])
    or by configuration.  Other fields of the label stack\n   entry are set as described
    below.\n"

    - "6.1.  MPLS Shim EXP Bit Values\n   If it is desired to carry Quality of Service
      information, the Quality\n   of Service information SHOULD be represented in
      the EXP field of the\n   PW label.  If more than one MPLS label is imposed by
      the ingress LSR,\n   the EXP field of any labels higher in the stack MUST also
      carry the\n   same value.\n"

      of the stack.\n"

  - "7.  Congestion Control\n   As explained in [RFC3985], the PSN carrying the PW
    may be subject to\n   congestion, the characteristics of which are dependent upon
    PSN type,\n   network architecture, configuration, and loading.  During congestion,\n
    \  the PSN may exhibit packet loss that will impact the service carried\n   by
    the PPP/HLDC PW.  In addition, since PPP/HDLC PWs carry an\n   unspecified type
    of services across the PSN, they cannot behave in a\n   TCP-friendly manner prescribed
    by [RFC2914].  In the presence of\n   services that reduce transmission rate,
    PPP/HDLC PWs will thus\n   consume more than their fair share and SHOULD be halted.\n
    \  Whenever possible, PPP/HDLC PWs should be run over traffic-engineered\n   PSNs
    providing bandwidth allocation and admission control mechanisms.\n   IntServ-enabled
    domains providing the Guaranteed Service (GS) or\n   DiffServ-enabled domains
    using EF (expedited forwarding) are examples\n   of traffic-engineered PSNs.  Such
    PSNs will minimize loss and delay\n   while providing some degree of isolation
    of the PPP/HDLC PW's effects\n   from neighboring streams.\n   The PEs SHOULD
    monitor for congestion (by using explicit congestion\n   notification, [VCCV],
    or by measuring packet loss) in order to ensure\n   that the service using the
    PPP/HDLC PW may be maintained.  When\n   significant congestion is detected, the
    PPP/HDLC PW SHOULD be\n   administratively disabled.  If the PW has been set up
    using the\n   protocol defined in [RFC4447], then procedures specified in [RFC4447]\n
    \  for status notification can be used to disable packet transmission on\n   the
    ingress PE from the egress PE.  The PW may be restarted by manual\n   intervention,
    or by automatic means after an appropriate waiting\n   time.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   The PPP and HDLC pseudowire type is subject to
    all the general\n   security considerations discussed in [RFC3985][RFC4447].  This\n
    \  document specifies only encapsulations, and not the protocols that\n   may
    be used to carry the encapsulated packets across the MPLS\n   network.  Each such
    protocol may have its own set of security issues,\n   but those issues are not
    affected by the encapsulations specified\n   herein.\n"
