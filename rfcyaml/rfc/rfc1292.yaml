    \t\t\t\t Editors\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    January 1992\n\t     A Catalog of Available\
    \ X.500 Implementations\nStatus of this Memo\n   This\tmemo provides information\
    \ for the Internet community.  It does\n   not specify an Internet standard. \
    \ Distribution of this memo\tis\n   unlimited.\nAbstract\n   The goal of this\
    \ document is\tto provide information regarding the\n   availability\tand capability\
    \ of implementations of X.500.  Comments\n   and critiques of this document, and\
    \ new or updated descriptions of\n   X.500 implementations are welcome.  Send\
    \ them to the\tDirectory\n   Information Services\tInfrastructure (DISI) Working\
    \ Group\n   (disi@merit.edu) or to the editors.\n1.  Introduction\n   This\tdocument\
    \ catalogs currently available implementations of X.500,\n   including commercial\t\
    products and openly available offerings.  It\n   contains descriptions of Directory\
    \ System Agents (DSA), Directory\n   User\tAgents (DUA), and DUA client applications.\
    \  The\tlatter can\n   include such\tapplications as\tbrowsers, DSA management\
    \ tools,\tor\n   lightweight DUAs that employ\tan application-level protocol to\n\
    \   communicate with a DUA (which then in turn communicates with\ta DSA)\n   to\
    \ support user service.  Section 2 of this document\tcontains a\n   listing of\
    \ implementations cross referenced by keyword.  This list\n   will\taid in identifying\
    \ particular implementations that meet\tyour\n   criteria.\n   To compile this\
    \ catalog, the\tDISI Working Group solicited input from\n   the X.500 community\
    \ by surveying several Internet mailing lists,\n   including: iso@nic.ddn.mil,\
    \ isode@nic.ddn.mil, osi-ds@cs.ucl.ac.uk,\n   and disi@merit.edu.\n   Readers\
    \ are encouraged to submit comments regarding both the\tform and\n   content \
    \ of\tthis  memo.  New submissions are always\twelcome.  Please\n   direct input\t\
    to the parties as described in the Status of  this  Memo\n   section.  DISI will\
    \ produce new versions of this document when a suf-\n   ficient number of changes\
    \ have been received.  This\twill  be  deter-\n   mined subjectively by the DISI\
    \ chairperson.\n1.1  Purpose\n   The growth of existing X.500\tpilot activities\
    \ (e.g.,\tWhite Pages\n   Pilot Project) and the advent of new\tpilots (e.g.,\
    \ ARRNet Directory\n   Services Project, NIST/GSA Pilot Project) are signals that\
    \ X.500 is a\n   viable directory service mechanism for the Internet community.\
    \  A\n   goal\tof DISI\tis to enable the continued growth of X.500 by lowering\n\
    \   the lack-of-information barrier.  This document takes one step toward\n  \
    \ that\tgoal by\tproviding an easily accessible source of information on\n   X.500\
    \ implementations.\n1.2  Scope\n   This\tdocument contains descriptions of either\
    \ commercially or freely\n   available X.500 implementations.  It\tdoes not provide\
    \ instructions on\n   how to install, run,\tor manage these\timplementations.\
    \  Because the\n   needs and computing environments of each organization differ\t\
    vastly,\n   no recommendations are given.  The descriptions and indices are\n\
    \   provided to make the\treaders\taware of existing options and to enable\n \
    \  more\tinformed choices.\n1.3 Disclaimer\n   Implementation descriptions were\
    \ written by implementors and\tvendors,\n   and not by the members of DISI.  Although\
    \ DISI has worked with the\n   description authors to ensure readability, no guarantees\
    \ can\tbe made\n   regarding the validity of descriptions or the value of said\n\
    \   implementations.  Caveat emptor.\n1.4  Overview\n   Section 1 contains introductory\
    \ information.\n   Section 2 contains a\tlist of\tkeywords, their\tdefinitions,\
    \ and a cross\n   reference of\tthe X.500 implementations by these keywords.\n\
    \   Section 3 contains the X.500\timplementation descriptions.\n   Section 4 lists\
    \ the editors'\taddresses.\n1.5  Acknowledgments\n   The creation\tof this\tcatalog\t\
    would not have been possible without the\n   efforts of the description authors\
    \ and the members of the DISI\n   Working Group.  The editors thank you for your\
    \ hard work and\n   constructive\tfeedback.  A special thanks is also extended\
    \ to\tthe\n   members of the NOCTools Working Group.  The \"Network\tManagement\
    \ Tool\n   Catalog\" (RFC-1147) served as a valuable example.  Bob Stine\tand\
    \ Bob\n   Enger made key suggestions that enabled us to learn from their\n   experiences.\n\
    \   The efforts of the editors were sponsored by\tDefense\tAdvanced\n   Research\
    \ Projects Agency Contract Number DACA76-89-D-0002 (Field\n   Operational X.500\
    \ Project), and U. S. Department of Energy Contract\n   Number DE-AC03-76SF00098.\n\
    2.  Keywords\n   Keywords are\tabbreviated attributes of the X.500 implementations.\n\
    \   The list of keywords\tdefined\tbelow was derived from the\n   implementation\
    \ descriptions themselves.  Implementations were indexed\n   by a\tkeyword\teither\
    \ as a result of: 1) explicit, not\timplied,\n   reference to\ta particular capability\t\
    in the implementation\n   description text, or\t2) input from the implementation\
    \ description\n   author(s).\n2.1  Keyword Definitions\n   This\tsection\tcontains\

    DSA/DUA, HP, IBM (Non-PC and RISC),\n   MIPS, Macintosh, Multiple Vendor Platforms,\
    \ OSI Transport, RFC-1006,\n   Sun\nABSTRACT\n   Alliance OSI\tincludes XDS (API),\
    \ DUA, DSA and DIB all as separate\n   components.\n   Touch's X.500 products\
    \ have been designed for complete portability to\n   any operating system\tor\
    \ hardware environment.  The protocols\tinclude\n   DAP and DSP of the OSI X.500\t\
    specification along with the required\n   XDS,\tDUA, DSA and DIB components. \
    \ In addition to X.500, Touch sup-\n   plies other OSI protocol layers including:\
    \ ROSE, ACSE, Presentation,\n   Session and any of the OSI lower layers (Transport,\
    \ Network along\n   with\tRFC-1006).  Touch also supplies\tother application layer\t\
    proto-\n   cols\tsuch as\tX.400, FTAM, CMIP (and general network management),\
    \ etc.\n   The Alliance\tOSI X.500 is compliant with the\tCCITT X.500 1988 Recom-\n\
    \   mendations. The ROSE/ACSE/Presentation/Session stack\tcan be option-\n   ally\t\
    provided by Touch.\n   The DUA may represent a single user,\tor may represent\
    \ a group of\n   users.  It may be attached to a given DSA within the\tsame system\
    \ but\n   is also capable of invoking operations in Touch's or\tany other\n  \
    \ vendor's compliant DSA on a remote system.  The binding operation\n   requires\
    \ the\tuser to\tgive a distinguished name and password in order\n   for the Directory\
    \ to\tidentify the user.  Once an association\tis esta-\n   blished the user may\t\
    invoke the following operations: READ, COMPARE,\n   ABANDON, LIST, SEARCH, ADD_ENTRY,\
    \ REMOVE_ENTRY, MODIFY_ENTRY,\n   MODIFY_RDN.\n   Due to the fact that\taccess\
    \ to the physical disk is in most\tcases  a\n   blocking  operation\t(synchronous)\
    \  Touch  has separated the\tdatabase\n   processing (I/O process) from the DSA\
    \ protocol entity.  This\t separa-\n   tion\tallows the DSA entity to continue\
    \ processing during the\tfrequent\n   database accesses from the DSA. The DSA\
    \ supports  all  the  Directory\n   operations  as specified in the CCITT X.500\
    \ specification.  Chaining,\n   Referral and\tMulticasting are provided and supported\t\
    in the\tAlliance\n   OSI\tDSA.   The DSA supports\tall the\tservice\tcontrol\t\
    options\tincluded\n   in the operation command arguments.\tFiltering  conditions\
    \  are  sup-\n   ported via the FILTER in the\tSEARCH operation.\n   The Alliance\t\
    OSI X.500 product supports all the NIST\tdefined\tmanda-\n   tory\tX.500 and X.400\t\
    object classes and attributes.\n   Alliance OSI\tX.500 supports all the mandatory\
    \ Directory attribute\n   types (and their associated abstract\tsyntaxes) in the\
    \ NIST Directory\n   implementation profile. Touch has extended the Directory\
    \ and\tallows\n   users to define private attributes.\tThis means that\ta user\
    \ can util-\n   ize the Alliance OSI\tDirectory for a\tgeneral\tpurpose, user\
    \ defined\n   database activity.\n   Touch provides a full set of\tadministration\
    \ and Directory management\n   facilities.\n   Touch is in the process of integrating\
    \ the X.500 product with the\n   Worldtalk 400 product. Worldtalk 400\tis Touch's\
    \ end user X.400 mes-\n   sage\tswitch,\tproviding gateways between proprietary\
    \ mail systems\n   (SMTP, Microsoft Mail, MHS, cc:mail,\tetc.) and X.400.  X.500\t\
    is a key\n   component for a messaging network.\nCOMPLETENESS\n   Strong Authentication\

    \ API,\tDSA/DUA, Free, Limited Functionality, Multiple Vendor Platforms,\n   Requires\
    \ ISODE, OSI Transport, RFC-1006, Sun, UNIX\nABSTRACT\n   The implementation consists\
    \ of a set\tDUA library routines, a\tterminal\n   interface, and a DSA. The implementation\
    \ was\tdeveloped in C on Sun 3\n   workstations\tunder the UNIX operating system.\
    \ All underlying\tservices\n   are provided\tby the ISODE development package.\
    \ The development pack-\n   age is also used for\tencoding and decoding ASN.1\
    \ data as well as for\n   other data manipulation services. Using the ISODE package\
    \ the imple-\n   mentation can be run\tover both OSI and TCP/IP protocols.\n \
    \  The DSA provides full support for both DAP and DSP protocols, confor-\n   mant\t\
    with ISO 9594/CCITT X.500 standards. The DIB is\tmaintained using\n   a locally\
    \ developed relational database system. The interface to the\n   database system\
    \ consists of a set of\tSQL-like C functions.  These are\n   designed to allow\
    \ straightforward replacement of the\tlocal database\n   system with a more powerful\
    \ commercial system. To achieve better per-\n   formance several options are\t\
    supported that permit loading of\n   selected portions of\tthe database into core.\t\
    When these options are\n   selected data can be\tretrieved more quickly from in-core\
    \ tables; all\n   modifications to the\tDIB are\tdirectly reflected in the in-core\
    \ tables\n   and the database.\nCOMPLETENESS\n   To date the Read, Compare, List,\
    \ Add\tEntry, and Remove Entry\topera-\n   tions have been implemented and are\
    \ supported over both DAP and DSP;\n   aliasing and\treplication are\talso supported.\t\
    \ The version under\n   current development (available January '92) includes\t\
    simple authenti-\n   cation, access control, and the Search operation. The modify\t\
    opera-\n   tions and Abandon are not supported and there is no support for\n \
    \  schema checking.\nINTEROPERABILITY\n   Have\tsuccessfully interoperated with\t\
    QUIPU and OSIWARE over the DAP.\n   No DSP interoperability testing has been done.\n\
    PILOT CONNECTIVITY\n   Not tested.\nBUGS\n   Some\ttesting\tin the near term future\t\
    will be\tdone to\ttry to identify\n   these, but presently\tit's not possible\
    \ to give an accurate list of\n   bugs.\nCAVEATS\tAND GENERAL LIMITATIONS\n  \
    \ No limitations on file sizes, etc. The only side effects to creating\n   large\
    \ files should be in the\tarea of\tperformance. Specifically,\n   optimization\t\
    requires loading parts of the DIB in core so greater\n   memory requirements will\
    \ be necessary for achieving better perfor-\n   mance with a\tlarge database.\t\
    \ Any platform the implementation can be\n   ported to (generally\tany platform\
    \ ISODE can be ported to) should sup-\n   port\tall features.\nINTERNETWORKING\t\
    ENVIRONMENT\n   RFC-1006; TP4/CLNP (SunLink OSI) over 802 and X.25 (SunLink X.25).\n\
    HARDWARE PLATFORMS\n   It has been run on Sun-3, but there are no known reasons\
    \ why\tit\n   should not run on any hardware running the ISODE software.\nSOFTWARE\
    \ PLATFORMS\n   It requires UNIX and\tthe ISODE software package.  It's been developed\n\

    \   DE (Directory Enquiries) is intended\tto be a\tsimple-to-use interface,\n\
    \   suitable for\tthe naive user,\tand suitable for running as a public\n   access\
    \ dua to provide lowest\tcommon denominator access to the Direc-\n   tory.  It\
    \ is\ta scrolling interface and will thus run\ton dumb\ttermi-\n   nals, even\
    \ teletypes!  The user is asked to fill in up to 4 questions\n   per query: person's\
    \ name; department; organization; country.\t The\n   prompts are very verbose\
    \ -- the intention is\tthat the user should not\n   be able get stuck, and information\
    \ on how to\tget into the help system\n   should always be on the screen.  The\t\
    help screens (of which there are\n   15) are aimed at the\tnon-technical user.\
    \  Whilst the\toutwards appear-\n   ance\tof the interface is simple, a lot of\
    \ attention has being given\n   to mapping the strings the user enters onto X.500\
    \ operations\tin such\n   a way that the interface seems to do\tthe \"right thing\"\
    .  An important\n   characteristic is the way the interface tries a series of\
    \ searches,\n   gradually relaxing the matching criteria from exact (in some\t\
    sense),\n   to good, through to \"fuzzy\".\t A considerable\tamount of configuration\n\
    \   is possible to present the results in locally acceptable formats.\n   DE was\

    \ public access dua.\tYou can\ttest the software by telnet to\n   128.86.8.56\
    \ and logging in as dua --\tno password required.\nCOMPLETENESS\n   The interface\
    \ is a querying engine only.\nINTEROPERABILITY\n   DE is built with the\tISODE\
    \ software (release\t7.0).  Its interopera-\n   bility relies on the\tcorrectness\

    \ COSINE Central DUA Service, and is\n   used\tby a number of UK institutions\
    \ as a public access dua (usually\n   over\tX.29).\tIt is able to query entries\
    \ in pilots throughout the\n   world.  It is not able to query for entries which\
    \ are in organiza-\n   tions beneath locality entries under\tcountry\tentries.\
    \  It is\tnot pos-\n   sible to query for people who do not\twork for organizations.\t\

    \ Free, Source, UNIX, Mul-\n   tiple Vendor\tPlatform, Needs\tISODE\nABSTRACT\n\
    \   The DIXIE protocol is used to give X.500 access to platforms\tthat\n   have\t\
    only TCP/IP access.  The DIXIE server is an intermediate proto-\n   col server\
    \ that communicates\twith Internet clients on one side using\n   a text-based\t\
    UDP/TCP\tprotocol and an\tX.500 DSA on the other side\n   using DAP.  The protocol\
    \ is fully described in RFC 1246.  A subset of\n   the X.500 DAP is exported to\t\
    the clients through the\tDIXIE protocol.\n   There is a DIXIE API\tprovided in\
    \ the\tform of\ta library of C-callable\n   routines.\n   The DIXIE protocol and\
    \ server are being used\tby the following\n   products/projects:\n     UD, a simple\
    \ command line white pages DUA for Unix\tmachines (dis-\n     tributed with the\
    \ DIXIE server)\n     maX.500, a\twhite pages DUA\tfor the\tMacintosh (available\
    \ from the\n     same place\tas the DIXIE server)\n     Network monitoring\tof\
    \ DSAs\tby our Network Operations Center\n     Lookup and\tdisplay\tof caller\
    \ identification based on telephone\n     caller ID (using ISDN).\nCOMPLETENESS\n\
    \   The DIXIE protocol does not support access to all X.500 features and\n   operations.\t\
    All DAP\toperations except Abandon are supported.  Gen-\n   eral\tsearches (including\
    \ multiple component searches) are supported.\n   The DIXIE protocol supports\
    \ none and\tsimple authentication.\tA subset\n   of the service controls are supported.\n\
    INTEROPERABILITY\n   The current implementation of the DIXIE server works\twith\
    \ the QUIPU\n   DSA and DAP library.\nPILOT CONNECTIVITY\n   The DIXIE server\
    \ has\tbeen tested in the Internet and\tPARADISE pilots.\n   It provides full\
    \ DUA\tConnectivity subject to\tthe limitations\tdis-\n   cussed above\tunder\
    \ completeness.\nBUGS\n   There are no\tknown outstanding bugs.\t But reports\
    \ should be sent to\n   x500@umich.edu.\nCAVEATS\tAND GENERAL LIMITATIONS\n  \
    \ None, aside from those mentioned above under\tcompleteness.\nINTERNETWORKING\t\
    ENVIRONMENT\n   DIXIE clients use TCP or UDP\tto communicate with the\tDIXIE server.\n\
    \   The DIXIE server uses RFC-1006 with TCP/IP to communicate with the\n   DSA,\t\
    though other transport mechanisms for DSA communication\tshould\n   be possible.\n\
    HARDWARE PLATFORMS\n   The DIXIE server is known to\trun on Sun 3, Sun 4, and\
    \ DEC 3100 plat-\n   forms.  It should run on any\tUNIX platform.\tThe DIXIE library\
    \ is\n   known to run\ton the same platforms, and also\ton the Macintosh.\nSOFTWARE\
    \ PLATFORMS\n   The DIXIE server and\tlibrary\tis known to run\tunder SunOS 3.5,\
    \ SunOS\n   4.1.1, Ultrix 4.1 and 4.2.  The DIXIE library also runs on the Macin-\n\
    \   tosh\tSystem Software\t6 or later.\nAVAILABILITY\n   This\tsoftware is openly\

    \ Directory Services for UNIX\tSystem V and\n   DS-521 X.500\tDirectory User Agent\
    \ (DUA) for UNIX System V form an\n   integral part of the\tRetix OSI Networking\
    \ Products family.  Designed\n   for systems vendors,\tpublic carriers, and other\
    \ OEMs, DS-520\tis a\n   complete high-performance implementation of X.500 in\t\
    source code\n   form, including a DUA, DSA Manager (DSAM), and DSA.\tDS-521\n\
    \   represents a\tsubset of this product offering. It provides the DUA\n   portal\
    \ into the directory, which, for example, meets\tthe needs of\n   software vendors\
    \ who\tplan to\tprovide\tapplication packages with X.500\n   Directory interaction\
    \ capabilities. Within these two\tofferings, the\n   DUA possesses two forms of\
    \ interface. The first form, the DUA with\n   User\tInterface, provides an interactive\
    \ character-based user\tinter-\n   face\tfor users of Directory services.  The\
    \ user agent provides access\n   to the Directory via\tbasic Directory\tservice\t\
    requests. The second\n   form, the DUA with Programmatic Interface provides a\t\
    standardized\n   programmatic\tinterface to application programs that must access\n\
    \   Directory information. The interface\tis conformant to the X/Open\n   Object\
    \ Management (XOM) and X/Open Directory\tServices (XDS) stan-\n   dards. This\
    \ component provides all functionality related to Directory\n   access and general\
    \ OSI services down\tto the session layer. The DSAM\n   provides an interactive\
    \ character oriented user interface to\ta Direc-\n   tory\tadministrator.\tThe\
    \ DSAM provides management functions either\n   local to or remote from a DSA.\
    \ Both the DUA and the DSAM are\tuseful\n   in the training, management,\tand\
    \ manipulation of Directory entries\n   maintaining operational and user attribute\
    \ information. The DSA main-\n   tains Directory database information\tand provides\
    \ users the ability\n   to read/compare, modify, search, and\tmanage entries within\
    \ the data-\n   base. It maintains all or fragments of the Directory\tInformation\
    \ Base\n   (DIB) and provides abstract service ports for DUAs and DSAs over DAP\n\
    \   and DSP protocols respectively.\nCOMPLETENESS\n   DS-520 represents a complete\t\
    implementation of the 1988 X.500 Recom-\n   mendations with the exception of strong\
    \ authentication as outlined in\n   X.509. It is\tconformant to NIST, EWOS, and\
    \ UK GOSIP Directory pro-\n   files. It provides session through application layer\t\
    protocol support\n   and hence incorporates ROSE,\tACSE, Presentation, and\tSession\t\
    within\n   its product stack. In addition to including all the attribute types,\n\
    \   syntaxes, and object\tclasses\tdefined\tin X.520 and X.521, the\tDS-520\n\
    \   includes support for\tthose specified\tin the 1988 X.400 Recommendation\n\
    \   X.402, Annex\tA. Remote on-line management of\tthe DSA\tis supported by\n\
    \   means of Network Management Forum CMIP.\n   DS-521 represents a complete\t\
    implementation of the X/Open Object\n   Management (OM) and X/Open Directory\t\
    Services (XDS) standards. It\n   also\tincorporates session through application\
    \ layer protocol\tsupport\n   and thus includes ROSE, ACSE, Presentation, and\
    \ Session within its\n   product stack.\nINTEROPERABILITY\n   The DS-520 has been\
    \ tested to interoperate with Banyan (DAP), CDC\n   (DSP), IBM, ICL, OSIWare,\
    \ Nixdorff, Unisys (DSP), Wollongong\t(DAP),\n   and 3-Com (DSP).\n   The DS-521\
    \ subset has undergone no separate interoperability\ttesting.\nPILOT CONNECTIVITY\n\
    \   DSA Connectivity provided by\tthe DS-520: The\tDSA provides complete\n   support\
    \ for the X.511 Abstract Service Definition, the directoryAc-\n   cessAC and the\
    \ directorySystemAC defined in the X.519 Protocol\n   Specifications, and the\
    \ Distributed Directory defined in the\tX.518\n   Procedures for the Distributed\
    \ Directory. It\tsupports all the object\n   classes, attribute types, and attribute\
    \ syntaxes defined in X.520 and\n   X.521. It does not support the Internet DSP\
    \ however.\n   DUA Connectivity provided by\tboth the DS-520\tand DS-521: The\t\
    DUA pro-\n   vides complete support for the X.511\tAbstract Service Definition\
    \ and\n   the directoryAccessAC defined in the\tX.519 Protocol Specifications.\n\
    \   The DUA with\tUser Interface supports\tonly a subset of the X.500\n   attributes\
    \ and object classes defined in X.520 and X.521. The DUA\n   with\tProgrammatic\
    \ Interface,\thowever, does support all the object\n   classes, attribute types,\
    \ and attribute syntaxes defined in these two\n   recommendations.\nBUGS\n   Product\
    \ Action Requests (PARs) stemming externally from customers and\n   internally\
    \ from customer service and\tquality\tassurance engineers are\n   generated and\

    CAVEATS\tAND GENERAL LIMITATIONS\n   DS-520 and DS-521 are source\tcode products\
    \ ported to\tUNIX System V\n   Release 3 and 4. Makefiles to generate the system\
    \ are provided for\n   the AT&T System V, SCO, and Interactive UNIX\tsystems.\n\
    INTERNETWORKING\tENVIRONMENT\n   DS-520 and DS-521 offer two main compile time\
    \ configuration options\n   and hence internetworking configurations. In\tthe\
    \ first of these, they\n   interface to\tthe UNIX System\tV Transport Library\
    \ Interface (TLI).\n   The TLI provides a path between the session layer of\t\
    a UNIX OSI\n   application process and an OSI transport provider installed in\
    \ the\n   UNIX\tkernel.\tThe latter transport provider may take the form\tof a\n\
    \   Retix Unix LAN (LT-610) or WAN (WT-325) transport product. The second\n  \
    \ main\toption utilizes\tthe UNIX System\tV ACSE/Presentation Library\n   interface\
    \ (APLI and the A/P Library), which provides\tOSI ACSE and\n   Presentation\t\
    layer services.\tThe Retix AP-240 Presentation syntax\n   manager product serves\
    \ to map the standard Retix Presentation layer\n   interface to\tthe AT&T APLI.\
    \ The APLI\tupper layers services may be\n   provided by the Retix UL-220\tproduct.\
    \ UL-220\tis the Retix implementa-\n   tion\tof the AT&T Open Networking Platform\
    \ Upper Layer Services module\n   and includes\tthe A/P\tlibrary, as well as the\t\
    OSI ACSE, Presentation,\n   and Session services.\n   DS-520 and DS-521 may also\
    \ run on top of the\tTCP/IP stack by\tmeans of\n   the Retix MP-120 product. MP-120\
    \ is a STREAMS based driver that\n   implements RFC-1006 and thus\tallows OSI\
    \ applications\tto run over a\n   network based on the\tInternet suite of protocols\
    \ (TCP/IP). Its main\n   function provides a conversion between the TCP stream\
    \ to the\tdata\n   packets required by OSI Transport Class 0 protocol and vice\
    \ versa. As\n   part\tof this\tprocess, it converts TCP/IP 32-bit addresses to\t\
    hex\n   values for use with OSI applications.\nHARDWARE PLATFORMS\n   Being source\t\
    code products ported to\tthe UNIX System\tV Release 3  and\n   4  operating\t\
    system environment, DS-520 and DS-521 are hardware plat-\n   form\tindependent.\

    \   maX.500 is a\tMacintosh X.500\tdirectory application useful for\n   displaying\
    \ and modifying white pages\tinformation about people.  It\n   runs\ton top of\
    \ the DIXIE protocol (described\tin RFC 1246).  maX.500\n   is currently\tin production\
    \ release 1.1 within the University\tof\n   Michigan and\tseveral\tother places.\n\
    \   Features include the\tability\tto display and modify the following\n   attributes:\
    \ title, description, commonName, uid, mail, postalAddress,\n   homePostalAddress,\
    \ telephoneNumber, facsimileTelephoneNumber, home-\n   Phone.  Photos can also\
    \ be displayed.  The software also provides\n   access to the finger\tprotocol.\
    \  Various preferences are user-\n   tailorable, including caching.\nCOMPLETENESS\n\
    \   maX.500 uses\tthe DIXIE protocol to access X.500 and thus is subject\n   to\
    \ the same completeness restrictions as DIXIE.  It provides\tRead,\n   Search,\
    \ and Modify capabilities.\nINTEROPERABILITY\n   Works with the DIXIE\tserver,\t\
    which works with the QUIPU DSA and DAP\n   library.\nPILOT CONNECTIVITY\n   It\
    \ has been tested (in conjunction with the DIXIE server) in\tboth the\n   Internet\
    \ and\tPARADISE pilots.\nBUGS\n   No outstanding bugs are known.  But reports\
    \ should be sent to\n   x500@itd.umich.edu.\nCAVEATS\tAND GENERAL LIMITATIONS\n\
    \   maX.500 is heavily oriented to white\tpages information and thus gen-\n  \
    \ eral\taccess to the DIXIE protocol is\tnot provided.\nINTERNETWORKING\tENVIRONMENT\n\

    \ part of the\tISODE which is an openly available implementa-\n   tion\tof the\
    \ upper layers of OSI.  QUIPU provides a X.500 Directory\n   System Agent\t(DSA)\
    \ and a set\tof Directory User Agents (DUA) aimed at\n   different terminal types\
    \ and\tmodes of interaction\n   QUIPU was first publicly demonstrated at ESPRIT\
    \ in November 1988.\n   QUIPU is being used extensively in the European PARADISE\
    \ project, the\n   White Pages Pilot Project and the Australian\tpilot.\tA QUIPU\t\
    DSA is\n   being used at the ROOT node of the Pilot DIT\tand is being used as\n\
    \   most\tcountry\tlevel DSAs.\n   QUIPU provides its own solutions to area not\t\
    specified by the 1988\n   standards such as replication and access control.\n\
    COMPLETENESS\n   QUIPU is aligned to the 1988\tISO IS and the NIST OIW\tDirectory\
    \ Imple-\n   mentors Guide Version 1, with the following exceptions:\n       Strong\
    \ authentication is\tnot implemented.\n       QUIPU does not enforce the bounds\
    \ constraints on\tattributes,\n       filters or APDU size.\n       T.61 string\
    \ formatting characters are not rejected.\n       If a DN is supplied with\tno\
    \ password in an unprotected simple\n       bind, QUIPU does\tnot always check\
    \ to see\tif the DN exists.  If\n       the DSA connected to can\tsay authoritatively\
    \ the\tDN does\tnot\n       exist, the association is rejected.  However, if\t\
    a chain\topera-\n       tion is required\tto check the DN, the bind IS allowed.\n\
    \       When comparing attributes of UTCtime syntax, if the seconds field\n  \
    \     is omitted, QUIPU does not perform the match correctly (i.e., the\n    \
    \   seconds field in\tthe attribute values should be ignored,\tbut  are\n    \
    \   not).\n       QUIPU always supplies the optional Chaining argument ``origina-\n\
    \       tor'' even if the CommonArgument\t``requestor'' is used.\n       QUIPU\
    \ always supplies the optional Chaining argument ``target''\n       even if the\
    \ base\tobject in the DAP arguments is the same.\n       The object class\t``without\
    \ an assigned object identifier'' is not\n       recognized unless the ``alias''\
    \ object class is also present.\n       Non Specific Subordinate\tReferences are\
    \ never followed by a QUIPU\n       DSA, but\tthey are passed\ton correctly to\t\
    the client if generated.\nINTEROPERABILITY\n   QUIPU has interworked with a\t\
    number of other\timplementations, and has\n   no know problems in such interworking.\n\
    PILOT CONNECTIVITY\n   QUIPU is in use in many directory pilots, certainly including\
    \ PARAD-\n   ISE and the White Pages Pilot Project.\nBUGS\n   Problems should\
    \ be reported to quipu-support@cs.ucl.ac.uk.\nCAVEATS\tAND GENERAL LIMITATIONS\n\
    \   None.\nINTERNETWORKING\tENVIRONMENT\n   QUIPU users TP0 over\tX.25, CONS and\
    \ TCP (using RFC-1006) or TP4 over\n   SunLink OSI.\n   The DSA knows about the\
    \ problems of unconnected networks and\tmakes\n   chain/refer choices based on\t\
    the network connectivity.  Using this an\n   X.25\tonly DSA can access data from\
    \ an Internet only DSA by chaining\n   operations through a\tDSA connected to\
    \ both networks.\nHARDWARE PLATFORMS\n   [No information provided--Ed.]\nSOFTWARE\
    \ PLATFORMS\n   The ISODE and QUIPU runs on native Berkeley (4.2, 4.3) and AT&T\
    \ Sys-\n   tem V, in addition to various other UNIX-like operating systems.  No\n\
    \   kernel modifications\tare required.\nAVAILABILITY\n   The ISODE is\tnot proprietary,\
    \ but it\tis not in the public domain.\n   This\twas necessary to include a \"\
    hold harmless\" clause in the\n   release.  The upshot\tof all this is that anyone\
    \ can get a copy of the\n   release and do anything they\twant with it, but no\
    \ one takes any\n   responsibility whatsoever for any (mis)use.\nDISTRIBUTION\
    \ SITES\n   The FTP or FTAM distributions of ISODE-7.0 consists of 3 files. The\n\
    \   source and main ISODE-7.0 distribution is in\tthe file isode-7.tar.Z\n   which\
    \ is approximately 4.7MB\tin size.\n   LaTeX source\tfor the\tentire document\t\

    \ Agent\t(DSA), a directory\n   access API, and a set of Directory User Agents\
    \ (DUAs) for different\n   terminal types. UCOM.X 500 is a commercial product\
    \ based on PIZARRO,\n   the research\tprototype developed at INRIA by\tChristian\
    \ Huitema's\n   team.\n   Some\tcharacteristics\tof the DSA are:\n       - The\
    \ DAP and DSP protocols are provided\tconformant with\tthe 1988\n       CCITT\
    \ X.500 recommendations.\n       - The DIB is maintained in ASN.1\tencoded\tformat\
    \ in the Unix file\n       system. Utilities are provided to load and dump the\
    \ DIB from and\n       to ASCII\ttext files.\n       - The DIT structure is held\
    \ in main memory. Additionally, fre-\n       quently used attributes may be held\
    \ in inverted tables in memory\n       to speed\tup searches.\n       - Knowledge\
    \ management: knowledge on managed domains is stored in\n       UCOM.X specific\
    \ attributes of the DSA entries.\n       - All X.500 (88)\tas well\tas some\t\
    X.400 (88) object classes,\n       attributes and syntaxes are supported. Users\
    \ may\tdefine their own\n       classes and attribute types.\n       - Schema\t\
    management: object class and attribute definitions are\n       enforced.\n   \
    \    - Simple\tauthentication is provided; strong authentication is not\n    \
    \   currently supported.\n       - Access\tcontrol: private mechanisms are\tprovided\
    \ to allow access\n       control lists to\tbe specified for parts of the DIT,\
    \ to control\n       modifications, and to specify access restrictions on attributes.\n\
    \   The UCOM.X 500 API provides the DAP protocol\tto applications\taccess-\n \
    \  ing the Directory. It is a synchronous API which automatically\n   manages\
    \ referrals. Several DUAs using the API, are available. These\n   include command\
    \ line\tand full screen\tinterfaces for users with ordi-\n   nary\tterminals,\
    \ and an X-Windows user interface (12/91). An X/Open\n   XDS API will\tbe offered\
    \ shortly.\n   UCOM.X 500 is used by French\tresearch centers involved in PARADISE,\
    \ a\n   COSINE project. A distributed application to\tcontrol\tdocument\n   transfer\
    \ in a large French hospital,\thas been built on the UCOM.X 500\n   API.\tIt is\
    \ being used for distributed applications management in the\n   French Post Office.\n\
    COMPLETENESS\n   UCOM.X 500 conforms to 1988 X.500 series of recommendations,\t\
    as\n   specified in\tparagraph 9 of X.519, with the exception of strong\n   authentication.\n\
    INTEROPERABILITY\n   Interoperability tests with other implementations, e.g. QUIPU,\
    \ have\n   been\tmade in\tthe PARADISE project. UCOM.X 500 is used in the\tFrench\n\
    \   PARADISE pilot.\nPILOT CONNECTIVITY\n   DSA and DUA connectivity to the PARADISE\
    \ pilots.  See caveats.\nBUGS\n   UCOM.X 500 is a commercial product. As such,\t\
    it is supported\tand bugs\n   are fixed when detected. Bug\treports\tcan be sent\
    \ to our support team\n   via electronic mail.\nCAVEATS\tAND GENERAL LIMITATIONS\n\
    \   The DIT structure is\tstored in main memory which means that the order\n \
    \  of magnitude\tof the number of objects supported per DSA is 10,000. By\n  \
    \ 1992\t100,000\tobjects\twill be\tsupported.\n   Not all syntaxes defined in\

    based directory\tapplication useful for display-\n   ing and modifying white pages\
    \ information about people.  It runs on\n   top of the DIXIE protocol (described\t\
    in RFC 1246).  ud was developed\n   to run under\tUnix and is currently in beta\
    \ release within U-M staff\n   and a few other places that have heard of it.\n\
    \   Features include the\tability\tto display and modify the following\n   attributes:\
    \ title, description, commonName, uid, mail, postalAddress,\n   homePostalAddress,\

    ABSTRACT\n   VTT X.500 contains a\tfull distributed DSA and a subroutine call\
    \ to\n   dua ( call_dua(parameters)).\tThis subroutine\tis linked to user's pro-\n\
    \   cess.  There\tare two\tways for dua to\tcommunicate with our DSA called\n\
    \   dsacvops: a fast communication through shared memory\tfor dua\tand dsa\n \
    \  in the same computer\tand a complete OSI-stack for communicating in\n   DAP-protocol\t\
    with remote dsa's which\tcan be any implementation of\n   X.500 dsa, not necessarily\
    \ dsacvops.\t DSA communicates with other\n   dsas\tthrough\ta full OSI-stack\
    \ with protocol DSP or with a shorter\n   stack when both dsas\tare dsacvops-processes.\t\
    \ dsacvops contains a\n   special purpose database DIB. VTT X500 contains caching\
    \ of read and\n   search results, access controls (as in Annex\tF of X.501), object\n\
    \   classes and attribute types as in X.520 and X.521 and simple\tauthen-\n  \
    \ tication with unprotected passwords in bind.\tThe network level can be\n   X.25\t\
    or TCP/IP. There are test duas,\tduacvops, duauser, with\ta simple\n   user\t\
    interface. Certificates\tfor strong authentication are included\n   to x509dua\
    \ and x509duacvops.\tVTT X500 is realized with program\n   development tools CVOPS\
    \ and CASN, the code is in C-language and uses\n   UNIX\tSystem V. The code is\
    \ fairly easy to port to other operating\n   systems.  VTT X500 was made for Smail\
    \ e-mail\tproduct\tof Nokia Data\n   Systems.\nCOMPLETENESS\n   Complete DAP\t\
    and DSP\tof 1988\tX.500 Recommendations are implemented.\n   There are the following\
    \ omissions: multicasting is not implemented,\n   strong authentication of calls\
    \ to dsa (optional signing of DAP and\n   DSP-calls, strong authentication in\
    \ bind, security error, security\n   parameters in common\targuments), T61\talternative\
    \ in CASE IGNORE and\n   CASE\tEXACT STRING, Criteria-syntax, TeletexTerminalIdentifier\
    \ syntax.\nINTEROPERABILITY\n   Interoperability with ISODE QUIPU 6.0 has been\
    \ tested, no formal test\n   suite was used.\nPILOT CONNECTIVITY\n   Not tested:\
    \ It should work in principle, but\thas not\tbeen tested.\nBUGS\n   No known bugs\

    \ DUA Only, Multiple Vendor Platforms, X\n   Window System, X.25,\t3Com\nABSTRACT\n\
    \   The DUA process runs\ton 3Com's dual-stack OSI/TCP terminal server,\n   scheduled\
    \ to\tbe released in mid-June\t1991.  It provides Presentation\n   Address resolution\
    \ for names, on behalf of the VTP application: when\n   the user attempts an\t\
    outgoing connection (\"VTP <name>\" or \"connect\n   <name>\"), <name> gets mapped\t\
    to its Presentation Address.\n   The DUA process supports the\tAddEntry, RemoveEntry,\
    \ and Search opera-\n   tions.  Via a menu-driven command, the system administrator\
    \ can con-\n   figure any of these operations, then\tsend the request to the\t\
    DSA.  He\n   would use the AddEntry operation to enter a resource\tname and its\n\
    \   corresponding physical address in the DIB, the DeleteEntry operation\n   to\
    \ remove the name and its physical address,\tand the\tSearch operation\n   (with\
    \ \"filter\" as an\toption)\tfor a display of all registered\tnames\n   or, given\
    \ a name, a display of the name's physical address.\n   Regarding unbinding from\
    \ a DSA, the system administrator could use an\n   UnbindDSA command or\tset a\
    \ timer which, once\texpired, would automati-\n   cally perform the unbinding.\t\
    \ The binding to\ta DSA, on the other\n   hand, is transparent, provided the system\
    \ administrator has set a DSA\n   address.  The binding is triggered by either\t\
    an outgoing connection\n   attempt or an operation request sent\tto the DSA.\n\
    \   The schema supported\tby the DUA consists of the following sequence of\n \
    \  object classes: Country, Organization, OrganizationalUnit (up to 3\n   levels\
    \ of OrganizationalUnits are allowed), ApplicationProcess, and\n   ApplicationEntity.\
    \  Their respective\tattributes are CountryName,\n   OrganizationName, OrganizationUnitName,\
    \ CommonName, and Presenta-\n   tionAddress.\t The CommonName\tof the ApplicationEntity\
    \ is always \"vt\"\n   for VTP and is transparent to the system administrator.\n\
    COMPLETENESS\n   Compliance with the ISO/IEC 9594 standards.\n   Handling referrals\
    \ not yet implemented.\n   Schema supported: Country, Organization, OrganizationalUnit,\n\
    \t\t     ApplicationProcess, and ApplicationEntity.\n   Authentication not supported.\n\
    INTEROPERABILITY\n   Interoperability with the ISODE QUIPU Directory Service and\
    \ any DSA\n   which strictly meets\tthe ISO/IEC 9495 standards.\nBUGS\n   [No\
    \ information provided--Ed.]\nCAVEATS\tAND GENERAL LIMITATIONS\n   Deleting an\
    \ entry will fail if the DUA is interacting with a\t6.0\n   based version of QUIPU.\
    \  This is a bug in QUIPU, and\tversion\t7.0\n   release will\thave it\tfixed.\n\
    \   Adding a CountryName\tis disallowed if the DUA is bound to QUIPU.\n   This\t\
    decision was made because to add a country in QUIPU, one needs\n   to bind as\
    \ the manager of the DSA holding the root EDB file,\tand such\n   information\
    \ may not always be available to the system administrator.\n   Also, our binding\
    \ is\tdone transparently.\nINTERNETWORKING\tENVIRONMENT\n   OSI environments with\

    \   July, 1991\nKEYWORDS\n   Free, IBM PC, Multiple Vendor Platforms, Needs ISODE,\
    \ UNIX, X Window\n   System\nABSTRACT\n   The xwp program is a\tsimple browser\
    \ for the QUIPU/X.500 directory.\n   It uses OSF/Motif and the X Window System\
    \ to\tprovide\ta convenient\n   user\tinterface.\n   The user interface consists\
    \ of five different top-level windows: the\n   main\twindow,\tthe search window,\
    \ and three option windows.  The main\n   window appears when the program is executed\
    \ and all others are\n   reached through its menus.  The main\twindow contains\t\
    Current\tLoca-\n   tion, Current Descendents, Descendent Filter, Current Information,\n\
    \   and Directory Status\tsubwindows.  The contents of these subwindows\n   show\t\
    information about the current location of the browser in the\n   directory tree.\
    \  The\tsearch window contains Search Area, Search\n   Filter, and Search Results\
    \ subwindows.\n   The mouse pointer may be used in the\tmain window to change\
    \ the\n   current location of the browser in the directory tree.  We can des-\n\
    \   cend\tdeeper into the\ttree by\tclicking the mouse when\tit points to a\n\
    \   member of the Current Descendents list.  Doing this \"moves\" the\n   browser\
    \ to this new (one level deeper) location in the directory\n   tree.  This causes\
    \ the main window to be updated as follows:\t(1) the\n   selected descendent becomes\
    \ the new Current Location, (2) its descen-\n   dents are listed in Current Descendents,\
    \ and\t(3) its\tcontents are\n   displayed in\tCurrent\tInformation.  Any problems\
    \ and messages\tfrom the\n   directory are displayed in the Directory Status portion\
    \ of the main\n   window.  To move the\tbrowser\tup the directory tree (i.e. towards\
    \ the\n   root), click\tthe mouse pointer on one of the\tcomponents of the\n \
    \  Current Location.  In this way it is\tpossible to move the browser to\n   any\
    \ location\tabove its current position (i.e. to any\tancestor) in one\n   mouse\
    \ click.\t Doing this causes the main window to be updated as dis-\n   cussed\
    \ above.  Due to directory-imposed limits, it may not always be\n   possible to\
    \ display all the descendents of the current position.  In\n   such\tcases (and\
    \ others) it may be useful to impose a\tfilter on the\n   descendents to be listed.\
    \  To do this, position the mouse pointer in\n   the Descendent Filter box and\
    \ use the keyboard to type in the desired\n   filter expression.  Typing <RETURN>\
    \ in this box causes the Current\n   Descendents list to be updated using\tthe\
    \ new\tfilter.\n   xwp was developed at\tthe University of Wisconsin - Madison\
    \ Computer\n   Sciences Department.\tIt is used in conjunction with the ECI mail\
    \ user\n   agent project.  xwp was written by Robert Lazarus, III.\nCOMPLETENESS\n\
