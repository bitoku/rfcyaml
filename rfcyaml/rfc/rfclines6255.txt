IANA Registries Abstract The Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) Research Group research group has defined many protocols such as the Bundle Protocol and Licklider Transmission Protocol.
The specifications of these protocols contain fields that are subject to a registry.
For the purpose of its research work, the group created ad hoc registries.
As the specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.
This document describes the actions executed by IANA.
The DTNRG research group has defined many protocols relevant to the DTN architecture [RFC4838] such as the Bundle Protocol [RFC5050] and Licklider Transmission Protocol [RFC5326].
The specifications of these protocols contain fields that are subject to a registry.
For the purpose of its research work, the group created ad hoc registries (http://www.dtnrg.org/wiki/AssignedNamesAndNumbers).
As the specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.
This document describes the actions executed by IANA.
Treatment of Flag Fields Encoded Using SDNVs
The DTN protocols use several extensible bit flag fields that are encoded as Self Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) as defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC5050].
For these fields, the registry specifies the allocation and usage of bit positions within the unencoded field.
The SDNV encoding treats the ensemble of bits in the unencoded value as a numeric value to be encoded on transmission and decoded on reception as described in [RFC5050].
Processing of SDNV encoded flags is discussed in [RFC6256].
Section 4.1 of [RFC5050] specifies that implementations are not required to handle SDNVs with more than 64 bits in their unencoded value.
Accordingly, SDNV encoded flag fields should be limited to 64 bit positions.
IANA registry policies and wording used in this document are described in [RFC5226].
The Bundle Protocol (BP) [RFC5050] has fields requiring a registry managed by IANA.
The Bundle Protocol has a Bundle Block Type code field (Section 4.5.2) [RFC5050].
An IANA registry has been set up as follows.
The registration policy for this registry is: 0 191:
Specification Required 192 255: Private or experimental use.
The Value range is: unsigned 8 bit integer.
The value "0" was not defined in any document or in the ad hoc registry.
As per consensus by the DTNRG research group, it is reserved per this document.
The Bundle Protocol has a version field (see Section 4.5.1 of [RFC5050]).
An IANA registry has been set up as follows.
The registration policy for this registry is: RFC Required
The Value range is: unsigned 8 bit integer.
Primary Bundle Protocol Version Registry
The value "0 5" was not defined in any document or in the ad hoc registry.
As per consensus by the DTNRG research group, it is reserved per this document.
The Bundle Protocol has a Bundle Processing Control Flags field (see Section 4.2 of [RFC5050]) encoded as an SDNV (see Section 2).
An IANA registry has been set up as follows.
The registration policy for this registry is: Specification Required The Value range is: Variable length.
1   Application data unit is
18   Request reporting of bundle
The Bundle Protocol has a Block Processing Control Flags field (see Section 4.3 of [RFC5050]).
An IANA registry has been set up as follows.
The registration policy for this registry is: Specification Required The Value range is: Variable length.
Delete bundle if block can't be
The Bundle Protocol has a Status Report Status Flag field (see Section 6.1.1 of [RFC5050]).
An IANA registry has been set up as follows.
The registration policy for this registry is: RFC Required
The Value range is: 8 bits.
Bundle Status Report Flags Registry
The value "00000000" was not defined in any document or in the ad hoc registry.
As per consensus by the DTNRG research group, it is reserved per this document.
Bundle Status Report Reason Codes
The Bundle Protocol has a Bundle Status Report Reason Codes field (see Section 6.1.1 of [RFC5050]).
An IANA registry has been set up as follows.
The registration policy for this registry is: Specification Required The Value range is: unsigned 8 bit integer.
No known route to destination from here
No timely contact with next node on route
As per consensus by the DTNRG research group, it is reserved per this document.
Bundle Custody Signal Reason Codes
The Bundle Protocol has a Bundle Custody Signal Reason Codes field (see Section 6.1.2 of [RFC5050]).
An IANA registry has been set up as follows.
The registration policy for this registry is: Specification Required The Value range is: unsigned 7 bit integer.
Bundle Custody Signal Reason Codes Registry
The value "127" was not defined in any document or in the ad hoc registry.
As per consensus by the DTNRG research group, it is reserved per this document.
This document requests the creation of registries managed by IANA.
There are no security issues involved.
Refer to the Security Considerations section of the referenced protocols.
IANA Considerations IANA has created the registries as described in the previous sections.
