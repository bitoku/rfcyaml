- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The \"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process:\n\
    \   Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees\" document [RFC3777]\n \
    \  defines the nominating committee process.  On the nominating\n   committee,\
    \ it is important to include people who have the experience\n   necessary to understand\
    \ the IETF process: those individuals can bring\n   a broader perspective to the\
    \ nominating committee and will help\n   ensure that the people it selects are\
    \ better prepared to fulfill the\n   roles.  That said, one of the key points\
    \ in the process and in the\n   selection of the nominating committee is that\
    \ the IETF wants to avoid\n   having the IAB and the IESG be self-selecting. \
    \ The selection of the\n   nominating committee, therefore, excludes individuals\
    \ who currently\n   serve on the bodies to which the nominating committee selects\
    \ seats.\n   RFC 3777 specifies that \"sitting members\" of the IAB and IESG \"\
    may\n   not volunteer to serve on the nominating committee\".  Since the time\n\
    \   that document was written, the IETF Administrative Oversight\n   Committee\
    \ (IAOC) was formed.  Some IAOC members are selected by the\n   nominating committee\
    \ (see [RFC4071], Section 4), and that body is not\n   covered by RFC 3777.  There\
    \ is also ambiguity in RFC 3777 about\n   whether ex officio members, liaisons,\
    \ and such are included as\n   \"sitting members\".  This document updates RFC\
    \ 3777 to clarify the\n   rules as they apply to members of the IAB, the IESG,\
    \ and the IAOC,\n   with the understanding of the intent of RFC 3777 as outlined\
    \ above.\n   RFC 3777 does not exclude participation by working group chairs,\
    \ IRTF\n   research group chairs, members of directorates and special review\n\
    \   teams, or members of other advisory bodies.  This document makes no\n   changes\
    \ in that regard.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Replacement of RFC 3777, Section 4, Rule 15\n   The following paragraph replaces\
    \ RFC 3777, Section 4, rule 15 in its\n   entirety.\n   15.  Any person who serves\
    \ on any of the Internet Society Board of\n   Trustees, the IAB, the IESG, or\
    \ the IAOC, including those who serve\n   on these bodies in ex officio positions,\
    \ may not volunteer to serve\n   as voting members of the nominating committee.\
    \  Liaisons to these\n   bodies from other bodies or organizations are not excluded\
    \ by this\n   rule.\n"
