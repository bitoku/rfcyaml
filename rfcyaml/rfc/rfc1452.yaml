    \          RFC 1452    Coexistence between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2   April 1993\n  \
    \        1.  Introduction\n          The purpose of this document is to describe\
    \ coexistence\n          between version 2 of the Internet-standard Network Management\n\
    \          Framework, termed the SNMP version 2 framework (SNMPv2) [1],\n    \
    \      and the original Internet-standard Network Management\n          Framework\
    \ (SNMPv1), which consists of these three documents:\n               RFC 1155\
    \ [2] which defines the Structure of Management\n               Information (SMI),\
    \ the mechanisms used for describing and\n               naming objects for the\
    \ purpose of management.\n               RFC 1212 [3] which defines a more concise\
    \ description\n               mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.\n\
    \               RFC 1157 [4] which defines the Simple Network Management\n   \
    \            Protocol (SNMP), the protocol used for network access to\n      \
    \         managed objects.\n          RFC 1452    Coexistence between SNMPv1 and\
    \ SNMPv2   April 1993\n          2.  Management Information\n          The SNMPv2\
    \ approach towards describing collections of managed\n          objects is nearly\
    \ a proper superset of the approach defined in\n          the Internet-standard\
    \ Network Management Framework.  For\n          example, both approaches use ASN.1\
    \ [5] as the basis for a\n          formal descriptive notation.  Indeed, one\
    \ might note that the\n          SNMPv2 approach largely codifies the existing\
    \ practice for\n          defining MIB modules, based on extensive experience\
    \ with the\n          current framework.\n          The SNMPv2 documents which\
    \ deal with information modules are:\n               Structure of Management Information\
    \ for SNMPv2 [6], which\n               defines concise notations for describing\
    \ information\n               modules, managed objects and notifications;\n  \
    \             Textual Conventions for SNMPv2 [7], which defines a\n          \
    \     concise notation for describing textual conventions, and\n             \
    \  also defines some initial conventions; and,\n               Conformance Statements\
    \ for SNMPv2 [8], which defines\n               concise notation for describing\
    \ compliance and\n               capabilities statements.\n          The following\
    \ sections consider the three areas: MIB modules,\n          compliance statements,\
    \ and capabilities statements.\n          MIB modules defined using the current\
    \ framework may continue\n          to be used with the SNMPv2 protocol.  However,\
    \ for the MIB\n          modules to conform to the SNMPv2 framework, the following\n\
    \          changes are required:\n          2.1.  Object Definitions\n       \
    \   In general, conversion of a MIB module does not require the\n          deprecation\
    \ of the objects contained therein.  Only if the\n          semantics of an object\
    \ truly changes should deprecation be\n          performed.\n          (1)  The\
    \ IMPORTS statement must reference SNMPv2-SMI, instead\n               of RFC1155-SMI\
    \ and RFC-1212.\n          RFC 1452    Coexistence between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 \
    \  April 1993\n          (2)  The MODULE-IDENTITY macro must be invoked immediately\n\
    \               after any IMPORTs or EXPORTs statement.\n          (3)  For any\
    \ descriptor which contains the hyphen character,\n               the hyphen character\
    \ is removed.\n          (4)  For any object with an integer-valued SYNTAX clause,\
    \ in\n               which the corresponding INTEGER does not have a range\n \
    \              restriction (i.e., the INTEGER has neither a defined set\n    \
    \           of named-number enumerations nor an assignment of lower-\n       \
    \        and upper-bounds on its value), the object must have the\n          \
    \     value of its SYNTAX clause changed to Integer32.\n          (5)  For any\
    \ object with a SYNTAX clause value of an\n               enumerated INTEGER,\
    \ the hyphen character is removed from\n               any named-number labels\
    \ which contain the hyphen\n               character.\n          (6)  For any\
    \ object with a SYNTAX clause value of Counter, the\n               object must\
    \ have the value of its SYNTAX clause changed\n               to Counter32.\n\
    \          (7)  For any object with a SYNTAX clause value of Gauge, the\n    \
    \           object must have the value of its SYNTAX clause changed\n        \
    \       to Gauge32.\n          (8)  For all objects, the ACCESS clause must be\
    \ replaced by a\n               MAX-ACCESS clause.  The value of the MAX-ACCESS\
    \ clause is\n               the same as that of the ACCESS clause unless some\
    \ other\n               value makes \"protocol sense\" as the maximal level of\n\
    \               access for the object.  In particular, object types for\n    \
    \           which instances can be explicitly created by a protocol\n        \
    \       set operation, will have a MAX-ACCESS clause of \"read-\n            \
    \   create\".  If the value of the ACCESS clause is \"write-\n               only\"\
    , then the value of the MAX-ACCESS clause is \"read-\n               write\",\
    \ and the DESCRIPTION clause notes that reading\n               this object will\
    \ result implementation-specific results.\n          (9)  For any columnar object\
    \ which is used solely for instance\n               identification in a conceptual\
    \ row, the object must have\n               the value of its MAX-ACCESS clause\
    \ set to \"not-\n               accessible\", unless all columnar objects of the\n\
    \               conceptual row are used for instance identification, in\n    \
    \           which case, the MAX-ACCESS clause for one of them must be\n      \
    \         something other than \"not-accessible\".\n          RFC 1452    Coexistence\
    \ between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2   April 1993\n          (10) For all objects, if the\
    \ value of the STATUS clause is\n               \"mandatory\", the value must\
    \ be replaced with \"current\".\n          (11) For all objects, if the value\
    \ of the STATUS clause is\n               \"optional\", the value must be replaced\
    \ with \"obsolete\".\n          (12) For any object not containing a DESCRIPTION\
    \ clause, the\n               object must have a DESCRIPTION clause defined.\n\
    \          (13) For any object corresponding to a conceptual row which\n     \
    \          does not have an INDEX clause, the object must have\n             \
    \  either an INDEX clause or an AUGMENTS clause defined.\n          (14) For any\
    \ object with an INDEX clause that references an\n               object with a\
    \ syntax of NetworkAddress, the value of the\n               STATUS clause of\
    \ the both objects is changed to\n               \"obsolete\".\n          (15)\
    \ For any object containing a DEFVAL clause with an OBJECT\n               IDENTIFIER\
    \ value which is expressed as a collection of\n               sub-identifiers,\
    \ change the value to reference a single\n               ASN.1 identifier.\n \
    \         Other changes are desirable, but not necessary:\n          (1)  Creation\
    \ and deletion of conceptual rows is inconsistent\n               using the current\
    \ framework.  The SNMPv2 framework\n               corrects this.  As such, if\
    \ the MIB module undergoes\n               review early in its lifetime, and it\
    \ contains conceptual\n               tables which allow creation and deletion\
    \ of conceptual\n               rows, then it may be worthwhile to deprecate the\
    \ objects\n               relating to those tables and replacing them with objects\n\
    \               defined using the new approach.\n          (2)  For any object\
    \ with a string-valued SYNTAX clause, in\n               which the corresponding\
    \ OCTET STRING does not have a size\n               restriction (i.e., the OCTET\
    \ STRING has no assignment of\n               lower- and upper-bounds on its length),\
    \ one might\n               consider defining the bounds for the size of the object.\n\
    \          (3)  For all textual conventions informally defined in the MIB\n  \
    \             module, one might consider redefining those conventions\n      \
    \         using the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro.  Such a change would\n         \
    \      not necessitate deprecating objects previously defined\n              \
    \ using an informal textual convention.\n          RFC 1452    Coexistence between\
    \ SNMPv1 and SNMPv2   April 1993\n          (4)  For any object which represents\
    \ a measurement in some\n               kind of units, one might consider adding\
    \ a UNITS clause\n               to the definition of that object.\n         \
    \ (5)  For any conceptual row which is an extension of another\n             \
    \  conceptual row, i.e., for which subordinate columnar\n               objects\
    \ both exist and are identified via the same\n               semantics as the\
    \ other conceptual row, one might consider\n               using an AUGMENTS clause\
    \ in place of the INDEX clause for\n               the object corresponding to\
    \ the conceptual row which is\n               an extension.\n          Finally,\
    \ when encountering common errors in SNMPv1 MIB\n          modules:\n        \
    \  (1)  For any object with a SYNTAX clause value of an\n               enumerated\
    \ INTEGER, if a named-number enumeration is\n               present with a value\
    \ of zero, the value of the STATUS\n               clause of that object is changed\
    \ to \"obsolete\".\n          (2)  For any non-columnar object that is instanced\
    \ as if it\n               were immediately subordinate to a conceptual row, the\n\
    \               value of the STATUS clause of that object is changed to\n    \
    \           \"obsolete\".\n          (3)  For any conceptual row object that is\
    \ not contained\n               immediately subordinate to a conceptual table,\
    \ the value\n               of the STATUS clause of that object (and all subordinate\n\
    \               objects) is changed to \"obsolete\".\n          2.2.  Trap Definitions\n\
    \          If a MIB module is changed to conform to the SNMPv2 framework,\n  \
    \        then each occurrence of the TRAP-TYPE macro must be changed to\n    \
    \      a corresponding invocation of the NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro:\n          (1)\
    \  The IMPORTS statement must not reference RFC-1215.\n          (2)  The ENTERPRISES\
    \ clause must be removed.\n          (3)  The VARIABLES clause must be renamed\
    \ to the OBJECTS\n               clause.\n          RFC 1452    Coexistence between\
    \ SNMPv1 and SNMPv2   April 1993\n          (4)  The STATUS clause must be added.\n\
    \          (5)  The value of an invocation of the NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro\n  \
    \             is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, not an INTEGER, and must be\n         \
    \      changed accordingly.\n          2.3.  Compliance Statements\n         \
    \ For those information modules which are \"standard\", a\n          corresponding\
    \ invocation of the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro must\n          be included within\
    \ the information module (or in a companion\n          information module), and\
    \ any commentary text in the\n          information module which relates to compliance\
    \ must be\n          removed.  Typically this editing can occur when the\n   \
    \       information module undergoes review.\n          2.4.  Capabilities Statements\n\
    \          In the current framework, the informational document [9] uses\n   \
    \       the MODULE-CONFORMANCE macro to describe an agent's\n          capabilities\
    \ with respect to one or more MIB modules.\n          Converting such a description\
    \ for use with the SNMPv2\n          framework requires these changes:\n     \
    \     (1)  Use the macro name AGENT-CAPABILITIES instead of MODULE-\n        \
    \       CONFORMANCE.\n          (2)  The STATUS clause must be added.\n      \
    \    (3)  For all occurrences of the CREATION-REQUIRES clause, note\n        \
    \       the slight change in semantics, and omit this clause if\n            \
    \   appropriate.\n          RFC 1452    Coexistence between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2\
    \   April 1993\n          3.  Protocol Operations\n          The SNMPv2 documents\
    \ which deal with protocol operations are:\n               Protocol Operations\
    \ for SNMPv2 [10], which defines the\n               syntax and semantics of the\
    \ operations conveyed by the\n               protocol; and,\n               Transport\
    \ Mappings for SNMPv2 [11], which defines how the\n               protocol operations\
    \ are carried over different transport\n               services.\n          The\
    \ following section considers two areas: the proxy behavior\n          between\
    \ a SNMPv2 entity and a SNMPv1 agent; and, the behavior\n          of \"bi-lingual\"\
    \ protocol entities acting in a manager role.\n          3.1.  Proxy Agent Behavior\n\
    \          To achieve coexistence at the protocol-level, a proxy\n          mechanism\
    \ may be used.  A SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent\n          role may be implemented\
    \ and configured to act in the role of a\n          proxy agent.\n          3.1.1.\
    \  SNMPv2 -> SNMPv1\n          When converting requests from a SNMPv2 entity acting\
    \ in a\n          manager role into requests sent to a SNMPv1 entity acting in\n\
    \          an agent role:\n          (1)  If a GetRequest-PDU, GetNextRequest-PDU,\
    \ or SetRequest-\n               PDU is received, then it is passed unaltered\
    \ by the proxy\n               agent.\n          (2)  If a GetBulkRequest-PDU\
    \ is received, the proxy agent sets\n               the non-repeaters and max-repetitions\
    \ fields to zero, and\n               sets the tag of the PDU to GetNextRequest-PDU.\n\
    \          3.1.2.  SNMPv1 -> SNMPv2\n          When converting responses received\
    \ from a SNMPv1 entity acting\n          in an agent role into responses sent\
    \ to a SNMPv2 entity acting\n          in a manager role:\n          RFC 1452\
    \    Coexistence between SNMPv1 and SNMPv2   April 1993\n          (1)  If a GetResponse-PDU\
    \ is received, then it is passed\n               unaltered by the proxy agent.\
    \  Note that even though a\n               SNMPv2 entity will never generate a\
    \ Response-PDU with a\n               error-status field having a value of `noSuchName',\n\
    \               `badValue', or `readOnly', the proxy agent must not\n        \
    \       change this field.  This allows the SNMPv2 entity acting\n           \
    \    in a manager role to interpret the response correctly.\n               If\
    \ a GetResponse-PDU is received with an error-status\n               field having\
    \ a value of `tooBig', the proxy agent will\n               remove the contents\
    \ of the variable-bindings field before\n               propagating the response.\
    \  Note that even though a SNMPv2\n               entity will never generate a\
    \ `tooBig' in response to a\n               GetBulkRequestPDU, the proxy agent\
    \ must propagate such a\n               response.\n          (2)  If a Trap-PDU\
    \ is received, then it is mapped into a\n               SNMPv2-Trap-PDU.  This\
    \ is done by prepending onto the\n               variable-bindings field two new\
    \ bindings: sysUpTime.0\n               [12], which takes its value from the timestamp\
    \ field of\n               the Trap-PDU; and, snmpTrapOID.0 [13], which is\n \
    \              calculated thusly: if the value of generic-trap field is\n    \
    \           `enterpriseSpecific', then the value used is the\n               concatenation\
    \ of the enterprise field from the Trap-PDU\n               with two additional\
    \ sub-identifiers, `0', and the value\n               of the specific-trap field;\
    \ otherwise, the value of the\n               corresponding trap defined in [13]\
    \ is used.  (For\n               example, if the value of the generic-trap field\
    \ is\n               `coldStart', then the coldStart trap [13] is used.) Then,\n\
    \               one new binding is appended onto the variable-bindings\n     \
    \          field: snmpTrapEnterpriseOID.0 [13], which takes its\n            \
    \   value from the enterprise field of the Trap-PDU.  To\n               determine\
    \ the destinations for the SNMPv2-Trap-PDU, the\n               proxy agent applies\
    \ the procedures defined in Section\n               4.2.6 of [10], with the exception\
    \ that no check is made\n               to see if the instances associated with\
    \ this trap are\n               present in the proxy agent's view.\n         \

    \  Bi-lingual Manager Behavior\n          To achieve coexistence at the protocol-level,\
    \ a protocol\n          entity acting in a manager role might support both SNMPv1\
    \ and\n          SNMPv2.  When a management application needs to contact a\n \
    \         protocol entity acting in an agent role, the entity acting in\n    \
    \      a manager role consults a local database to select the correct\n      \
    \    management protocol to use.\n          In order to provide transparency to\
    \ management applications,\n          the entity acting in a manager role must\
    \ map operations as if\n          it were acting as a proxy agent.\n         \
