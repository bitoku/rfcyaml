  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IEEE 802.1 Provider Backbone Bridges specification [PBB]\
    \ defines\n   an architecture and bridge protocols for interconnection of multiple\n\
    \   Provider Bridged Networks (PBNs).  PBB can be used to attain better\n   scalability\
    \ than Provider Bridges [PB] in terms of the number of\n   customer Media Access\
    \ Control (MAC) addresses and the number of\n   service instances that can be\
    \ supported.  PBB provides a data-plane\n   hierarchy and new addressing designed\
    \ to achieve such better\n   scalability in Provider Backbone Networks.  A number\
    \ of Ethernet\n   control-plane protocols, such as the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol\n\
    \   (RSTP), the Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP), and Shortest Path\n  \
    \ Bridging (SPB), could be deployed as the core control plane for loop\n   avoidance\
    \ and load balancing for PBB.  The applicability of these\n   control protocols\
    \ is out of scope for this document.\n   The Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)\
    \ provides a solution for\n   extending Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling\
    \ capabilities,\n   through a routed MPLS backbone without requiring the use of\
    \ a native\n   Ethernet control-plane protocol across the backbone.  VPLS use\
    \ of\n   the structured FEC 129 [RFC4762] also allows for inter-domain,\n   inter-provider\
    \ connectivity and enables auto-discovery options across\n   the network, improving\
    \ the service delivery options.\n   A hierarchical solution for VPLS was introduced\
    \ in [RFC4761] and\n   [RFC4762] to provide improved scalability and efficient\
    \ handling of\n   packet replication.  These improvements are achieved by reducing\
    \ the\n   number of Provider Edge (PE) devices connected in a full-mesh\n   topology\
    \ through the creation of two-tier PEs.  A User-facing PE\n   (U-PE) aggregates\
    \ all the Customer Edge (CE) devices in a lower-tier\n   access network and then\
    \ connects to the Network-facing PE (N-PE)\n   device(s) deployed around the core\
    \ domain.  In VPLS, Media Access\n   Control (MAC) address learning and forwarding\
    \ are done based on\n   Customer MAC addresses (C-MACs); this poses scalability\
    \ issues on the\n   N-PE devices as the number of VPLS instances (and thus C-MACs)\n\
    \   increases.  Furthermore, since a set of pseudowires (PWs) is\n   maintained\
    \ on a \"per customer service instance\" basis, the number of\n   PWs required\
    \ at N-PE devices is proportional to the number of\n   customer service instances\
    \ multiplied by the number of N-PE devices\n   in the full-mesh set.  This can\
    \ result in scalability issues (in\n   terms of PW manageability and troubleshooting)\
    \ as the number of\n   customer service instances grows.\n   This document describes\
    \ how PBB can be integrated with VPLS to allow\n   for useful PBB capabilities\
    \ while continuing to avoid the use of MSTP\n   in the backbone.  The combined\
    \ solution referred to in this document\n   as PBB-VPLS results in better scalability\
    \ in terms of the number of\n   service instances, PWs, and C-MACs that need to\
    \ be handled in the\n   VPLS PEs.\n   Section 2 provides a quick terminology reference.\
    \  Section 3 covers\n   the reference model for PBB VPLS PEs.  Section 4 describes\
    \ the packet\n   walkthrough.  Sections 5 through 7 discuss the PBB-VPLS usage\
    \ of\n   existing VPLS mechanisms -- the control plane; efficient packet\n   replication;\
    \ and Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).\n"

    \               Figure 1: PBB Bridge Model\n   Provider Backbone Bridges (PBBs)\
    \ [PBB] offer a scalable solution for\n   service providers to build large bridged\
    \ networks.  The focus of PBB\n   is primarily on improving two main areas with\
    \ provider Ethernet\n   bridged networks:\n     - MAC-address table scalability\n\
    \     - Service instance scalability\n   To obviate the above two limitations,\
    \ PBB introduces a hierarchical\n   network architecture with associated new frame\
    \ formats that extend\n   the work completed by Provider Bridges (PBs).  In the\
    \ PBBN\n   architecture, customer networks (using PBs) are aggregated into\n \
    \  PBBNs, which utilize the IEEE PBB frame format.  The frame format\n   employs\
    \ a MAC tunneling encapsulation scheme for tunneling customer\n   Ethernet frames\
    \ within provider Ethernet frames across the PBBN.  A\n   VLAN identifier (B-VID)\
    \ is used to segregate the backbone into\n   broadcast domains, and a new 24-bit\
    \ service identifier (I-SID) is\n   defined and used to associate a given customer\
    \ MAC frame with a\n   provider service instance (also called the service delimiter).\
    \  It\n   should be noted that in [PBB] there is a clear segregation between\n\
    \   provider service instances (represented by I-SIDs) and provider VLANs\n  \
    \ (represented by B-VIDs), which was not the case for PBs.\n   As shown in Figure\
    \ 1, a PBB bridge may consist of a single\n   B-component and one or more I-components.\
    \  In simple terms, the\n   B-component provides bridging in the provider space\
    \ (B-MAC, B-VLAN),\n   and the I-component provides bridging in the customer space\
    \ (C-MAC,\n   S-VLAN).  The customer frame is first encapsulated with the provider\n\
    \   backbone header (B-MAC, B-tag, I-tag); then, the bridging is\n   performed\
    \ in the provider backbone space (B-MAC, B-VLAN) through the\n   network till\
    \ the frame arrives at the destination BEB, where it gets\n   decapsulated and\
    \ passed to the CE.  If a PBB bridge consists of both\n   I-components and B-components,\
    \ then it is called an IB-BEB, and if it\n   only consists of either B-components\
    \ or I-components, then it is\n   called a B-BEB or an I-BEB, respectively.  The\
    \ interface between an\n   I-BEB or IB-BEB and a CE is called an S-tagged service\
    \ interface, and\n   the interface between an I-BEB and a B-BEB (or between two\
    \ B-BEBs) is\n   called an I-tagged service interface.  The interface between\
    \ a B-BEB\n   or IB-BEB and a Backbone Core Bridge (BCB) is called a B-tagged\n\
    \   service interface.\n   To accommodate the PBB components, the VPLS model defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC4664] is extended as depicted in Figure 2.\n        +----------------------------------------+\n\

    \   The PBB module as defined in the [PBB] specification is expanded to\n   interact\
    \ with VPLS Forwarders.  The VPLS Forwarders are used in\n   [RFC4762] to build\
    \ a PW mesh or a set of spoke PWs (Hierarchical VPLS\n   (H-VPLS) topologies).\
    \  The VPLS instances are represented externally\n   in the MPLS context by a\
    \ Layer 2 Forwarding Equivalence Class (L2FEC)\n   that binds related VPLS instances\
    \ together.  VPLS Signaling\n   advertises the mapping between the L2FEC and the\
    \ PW labels and\n   implicitly associates the VPLS bridging instance to the VPLS\n\
    \   Forwarders [RFC4762].\n   In the PBB-VPLS case, the backbone service instance\
    \ in the\n   B-component space (B-VID) is represented in the backbone MPLS network\n\
    \   using a VPLS instance.  In the same way as for the regular VPLS case,\n  \
    \ existing signaling procedures are used to generate through PW labels\n   the\
    \ linkage between VPLS Forwarders and the backbone service\n   instance.\n   Similarly,\
    \ with the regular H-VPLS, another L2FEC may be used to\n   identify the customer\
    \ service instance in the I-component space.\n   This will be useful, for example,\
    \ to address the PBB-VPLS N-PE case\n   where H-VPLS spokes are connecting the\
    \ PBB-VPLS N-PE to a VPLS U-PE.\n   It is important to note that the PBB-VPLS\
    \ solution inherits the PBB\n   service aggregation capability where multiple\
    \ customer service\n   instances may be mapped to a backbone service instance.\
    \  In the\n   PBB-VPLS case, this means multiple customer VPNs can be transported\n\
    \   using a single VPLS instance corresponding to the backbone service\n   instance,\
    \ thus substantially reducing resource consumption in the\n   VPLS core.\n"

  - "4.  Packet Walkthrough\n   Since the PBB bridge module inherently performs forwarding,\
    \ the PE\n   reference model of Figure 2 can be expanded as shown in Figure 3.\n\
    \   Furthermore, the B-component is connected via several virtual\n   interfaces\
    \ to the PW Forwarder module.  The function of the PW\n   Forwarder is defined\
    \ in [RFC3985].  In this context, the PW Forwarder\n   simply performs the mapping\
    \ of the PWs to the virtual interface on\n   the B-component, without the need\
    \ for any MAC lookup.\n   This simplified model takes full advantage of the PBB\

    \ 3: Packet Walkthrough for PBB VPLS PE\n   In order to better understand the\
    \ data-plane walkthrough, let us\n   consider the example of a PBB packet arriving\
    \ over a Backbone\n   pseudowire (B-PW).  The PSN header is used to carry the\
    \ PBB\n   encapsulated frame over the backbone while the PW label will point to\n\
    \   the related Backbone Service Instance (B-SI), in the same way as for\n   regular\
    \ VPLS.  The PW label has in this case an equivalent role with\n   the backbone\
    \ VLAN identifier on the PBB B-tagged interface.\n   An example of the PBB packet\
    \ for the regular Ethernet PW is depicted\n   on the right-hand side of Figure\
    \ 3.  The MPLS packet from the MPLS\n   core network is received by the PBB-VPLS\
    \ PE.  The PW Forwarder\n   function of the PE uses the PW label to derive the\
    \ virtual\n   interface-id on the B-component, and then, after removing the PSN\
    \ and\n   PW encapsulation, it passes the packet to the B-component.  From\n \
    \  there on, the processing and forwarding are performed according to\n   [PBB],\
    \ where bridging based on the Backbone MAC (B-MAC) Destination\n   Address (DA)\
    \ is performed.  This scenario results in one of the\n   following outcomes:\n\
    \   1. The packet is forwarded to a physical interface on the\n      B-component.\
    \  In this case, the PBB Ethernet frame is forwarded\n      as is.\n   2. The\
    \ packet is forwarded to a virtual interface on the B-component.\n      This is\
    \ not typically the case, because of a single split-horizon\n      group within\
    \ a VPLS instance; however, if there is more than one\n      split-horizon group,\
    \ then such forwarding takes place.  In this\n      case, the PW Forwarder module\
    \ adds the PSN and PW labels before\n      sending the packet out.\n   3. The\
    \ packet is forwarded toward the access side via one of the\n      I-tagged service\
    \ interfaces connected to the corresponding\n      I-components.  In this case,\
    \ the I-component removes the B-MAC\n      header according to [PBB] and bridges\
    \ the packet using the\n      C-MAC DA.\n   If the destination B-MAC is an unknown\
    \ MAC address or a Group MAC\n   address (multicast or broadcast), then the B-component\
    \ floods the\n   packet to one or more of the three destinations described above.\n"

  - "5.  Control Plane\n   The control-plane procedures described in [RFC6074], [RFC4761],\
    \ and\n   [RFC4762] can be reused in a PBB-VPLS to set up the PW infrastructure\n\
    \   in the service provider and/or customer bridging space.  This allows\n   porting\
    \ the existing control-plane procedures (e.g., BGP\n   Auto-Discovery (BGP-AD),\
    \ PW setup, VPLS MAC flushing, PW OAM) for\n   each domain.\n"

  - "6.  Efficient Packet Replication in PBB VPLS\n   The PBB VPLS architecture takes\
    \ advantage of the existing VPLS\n   features addressing packet replication efficiency.\
    \  The H-VPLS\n   hierarchy may be used in both customer and backbone service\
    \ instances\n   to reduce the redundant distribution of packets over the core.\
    \  IGMP\n   and PIM snooping may be applied on a \"per customer service instance\"\
    \n   basis to control the distribution of the multicast traffic to\n   non-member\
    \ sites.\n   [IEEE-802.1Q] specifies the use of the Multiple MAC Registration\n\
    \   Protocol (MMRP) for flood containment in the backbone instances.  The\n  \
    \ same solution can be ported in the PBB-VPLS solution.\n   Further optimizations\
    \ of the packet replication in PBB-VPLS are out\n   of the scope of this document.\n"
