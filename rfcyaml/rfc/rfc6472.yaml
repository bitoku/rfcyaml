  - "Abstract\n   This document recommends against the use of the AS_SET and\n   AS_CONFED_SET\
    \ types of the AS_PATH in BGPv4.  This is done to\n   simplify the design and\
    \ implementation of BGP and to make the\n   semantics of the originator of a route\
    \ more clear.  This will also\n   simplify the design, implementation, and deployment\
    \ of ongoing work\n   in the Secure Inter-Domain Routing Working Group.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH attribute (Sections\
    \ 4.3\n   and 5.1.2 of [RFC4271]) is created by a router that is performing\n\
    \   route aggregation and contains an unordered set of Autonomous Systems\n  \
    \ (ASes) that the update has traversed.  The AS_CONFED_SET path type\n   ([RFC5065])\
    \ of the AS_PATH attribute is created by a router that is\n   performing route\
    \ aggregation and contains an unordered set of Member\n   AS Numbers in the local\
    \ confederation that the update has traversed.\n   It is very similar to AS_SETs\
    \ but is used within a confederation.\n   By performing aggregation, a router\
    \ is, in essence, combining\n   multiple existing routes into a single new route.\
    \  This type of\n   aggregation blurs the semantics of what it means to originate\
    \ a\n   route.  Said aggregation can therefore cause operational issues, such\n\
    \   as not being able to authenticate a route origin for the aggregate\n   prefix\
    \ in new BGP security technologies (such as those that take\n   advantage of the\
    \ \"X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS\n   Identifiers\" [RFC3779]).  This\
    \ in turn would result in reachability\n   problems for the aggregated prefix\
    \ and its components (i.e., more\n   specifics).  Said aggregation also creates\
    \ traffic engineering\n   issues, because the precise path information for the\
    \ component\n   prefixes is not preserved.\n   From analysis of past Internet\
    \ routing data, it is apparent that\n   aggregation that involves AS_SETs is very\
    \ seldom used in practice on\n   the public network [Analysis] and, when it is\
    \ used, it is usually\n   used incorrectly -- reserved AS numbers ([RFC1930])\
    \ and/or only a\n   single AS in the AS_SET are by far the most common case. \
    \ Because the\n   aggregation involving AS_SETs is very rarely used, the reduction\
    \ in\n   table size provided by said aggregation is extremely small, and any\n\
    \   advantage thereof is outweighed by additional complexity in BGP.  As\n   noted\
    \ above, said aggregation also poses impediments to\n   implementation of said\
    \ new BGP security technologies.\n   In the past, AS_SET had been used in a few\
    \ rare cases to allow route\n   aggregation where two or more providers could\
    \ form the same prefix,\n   using the exact match of the other's prefix in some\
    \ advertisement and\n   configuring the aggregation differently elsewhere.  The\
    \ key to\n   configuring this correctly was to form the aggregate at the border\
    \ in\n   the outbound BGP policy and omit prefixes from the AS that the\n   aggregate\
    \ was being advertised to.  The AS_SET therefore allowed this\n   practice without\
    \ the loss of BGP's AS_PATH loop protection.  This use\n   of AS_SET served a\
    \ purpose that fell in line with the original\n   intended use.  Without the use\
    \ of AS_SET, aggregates must always\n   contain only less specific prefixes (not\
    \ less than or equal to), and\n   must never aggregate an exact match.\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Recommendation to Network Operators
  contents:
  - "3.  Recommendation to Network Operators\n   It is RECOMMENDED that operators\
    \ not generate any new announcements\n   containing AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs.\
    \  If they have already announced\n   routes with AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs in\
    \ them, then they SHOULD\n   withdraw those routes and re-announce routes for\
    \ the component\n   prefixes (i.e., the additional specifics of the previously\
    \ aggregated\n   prefix) without AS_SETs in the updates.  This involves undoing\
    \ the\n   aggregation that was previously performed (with AS_SETs), and\n   announcing\
    \ more specifics (without AS_SETs).  Route aggregation that\n   was previously\
    \ performed by proxy aggregation (i.e., without the use\n   of AS_SETs) is still\
    \ possible under some conditions.  As with any\n   change, the operator should\
    \ understand the full implications of the\n   change.\n   It is worth noting that\
    \ new technologies (such as those that take\n   advantage of the \"X.509 Extensions\
    \ for IP Addresses and AS\n   Identifiers\" [RFC3779]) might not support routes\
    \ with AS_SETs/\n   AS_CONFED_SETs in them, and may treat as infeasible routes\
    \ containing\n   them.  Future BGP implementations may also do the same.  It is\n\
    \   expected that, even before the deployment of these new or future\n   technologies,\
    \ operators may filter routes with AS_SETs/AS_CONFED_SETs\n   in them.  Other\
    \ than making that observation, this document is not\n   intended to make any\
    \ recommendation for how an operator should behave\n   when receiving a route\
    \ with AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET in it.  This\n   document's focus is entirely on\
    \ the sender side, as discussed in the\n   preceding paragraph.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document discourages the use of aggregation\
    \ techniques that\n   create AS_SETs.  Future work may update the protocol to\
    \ remove\n   support for the AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH attribute.\n\
    \   This future work will remove complexity and code that are not\n   exercised\
    \ very often, thereby decreasing the attack surface.  This\n   future work will\
    \ also simplify the design and implementation of the\n   Resource Public Key Infrastructure\
    \ (RPKI) and systems that will\n   rely on it.\n"
