  - "Host Address Changes Involving RAND and ISI\n   This week the RAND IMP was temporarily\
    \ removed from the\n   Network and a new IMP was installed at ISI.  Some of the\n\
    \   people and computers from RAND have moved to ISI, in\n   particular the RAND\
    \ TENEX is now the ISI TENEX.  The address\n   of the ISI IMP is 86 (decimal)\
    \ and the TENEX at ISI is Host\n   number one; thus the \"Network Address\" of\
    \ the ISI TENEX is 86.\n   Sometime early next week the RAND IMP will be re-installed.\n\
    \   It will still be IMP number 7, and the IBM 360/65 at RAND will\n   still be\
    \ \"Network Address\" 7.\n    [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for\
    \ entry ]\n    [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n   \
