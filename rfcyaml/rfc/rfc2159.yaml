  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document contains the definitions, originally contained
    in RFC\n   1494, on how to carry CCITT G3Fax in MIME, and how to translate it
    to\n   its X.400 representation.\n   NOTE: At the moment, this format does not
    seem appropriate for a\n   \"general purpose image format for the Internet\",
    if such a beast can\n   exist. It exists only to carry information that is already
    in G3 Fax\n   format, and may be usefully converted to other formats when used
    in\n   specific contexts.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction

  - "2.  The image/g3fax content-type\n   This content-type is defined to carry G3
    Facsimile byte streams.\n   In general, a G3Fax image contains 3 pieces of information:\n
    \    (1)   A set of flags indicating the particular coding scheme.\n           CCITT
    Recommendation T.30 defines how the flags are\n           transmitted over telephones.
    \ In this medium, the flags are\n           carried as parameters in the MIME
    content-type header\n           field.\n     (2)   A structure that divides the
    bits into pages.  CCITT\n           recommendation T.4 describes a \"return to
    command mode\"\n           string; this is used here to indicate page breaks.\n
    \    (3)   For each page, a sequence of bits that form the encoding of\n           the
    image.  CCITT recommendation T.4 defines the bit image\n           format.  This
    is used without change.  The highest bit of\n           the first byte is the
    first bit of the T.4 bitstream.\n"

    - "2.1.  G3Fax Parameters\n   The following parameters are defined:\n      (1)
      \  page-length - possible values: A4, B4 and Unlimited\n      (2)   page-width
      - possible values: A3, A4, B4\n      (3)   encoding - possible values: 1-dimensional,
      2-dimensional,\n            Uncompressed\n      (4)   resolution - possible
      values: Fine, Coarse\n      (5)   DCS - a bit string, represented in Base64.\n
      \     (6)   pages - an integer, giving the number of pages in the\n            document\n
      \  If nothing is specified, the default parameter settings are:\n      page-length=A4\n
      \     page-width=A4\n      encoding=1-dimensional\n      resolution=Coarse\n
      \  It is possible (but misleading) to view the representation of these\n   values
      as single-bit flags. They correspond to the following bits of\n   the T.30 control
      string and X.400 G3FacsimileParameters:\n       Parameter               T.30
      bit        X.400 bit\n       page-length=A4             no bit set\n       page-length=B4
      \         19              21\n       page-length=Unlimited   20              20\n
      \      page-width=A4              no bit set\n       page-width=A3           18
      \             22\n       page-width=B4           17              23\n       encoding=1-dimensional
      \    no bit set\n       encoding=2-dimensional  16              8\n       encoding=Uncompressed
      \  26              30\n       resolution=Coarse          no bit set\n       resolution=Fine
      \        15              9\n   The reason for the different bit numbers is that
      X.400 counts bits in\n   an octet from the MSB down to the LSB, while T.30 uses
      the opposite\n   numbering scheme.\n   If any bit but these are set in the Device
      Control String, the DCS\n   parameter should be supplied.\n"

    - "2.2.  Content Encoding\n   X.400 defines the g3-facsimile data stream as a
      SEQUENCE of BIT\n   STRINGs. Each BIT STRING is a page of facsimile image data,
      encoded\n   as defined by Recommendation T.4.  The following content encoding
      is\n   reversible between MIME and X.400 and ensures that page breaks are\n
      \  honored in the MIME representation.\n   An EOL is defined as a bit sequence
      of\n       000000000001 (eleven zeroes and a one).\n   Each page of the message
      is delimited by a sequence of six (6) EOLs\n   that MUST start on a byte boundary.
      \ The image bit stream is padded\n   with zeroes as needed to achieve this alignment.\n
      \  Searching for the boundary is a matter of searching for the byte\n   sequence
      (HEX) 00 10 01 00 10 01 00 10 01, which cannot occur inside\n   the image.\n
      \  See Section 7.5 for the algorithm on conversion between this encoding\n   and
      the X.400 encoding.\n   The Base64 content-transfer-encoding is appropriate
      for carrying this\n   content-type.\n"

    image/g3fax\n   Conversion Type: nearly Byte copy\n   Comments:\n   The Parameters
    of the X.400 G3Fax body part are mapped to the\n   corresponding Parameters on
    the MIME Image/G3Fax body part and vice\n   versa.  Note that:\n      (1)   If
    fineResolution is not specified, pixels will be twice as\n            tall as
    they are wide\n      (2)   If any bit not corresponding to a specially named option
    is\n            set in the G3Fax NonBasicParameters, the \"DCS\" parameter\n            must
    be used.\n      (3)   Interworking is not guaranteed if any bit apart from those\n
    \           specially named are used in the NonBasicParameters\n   From X.400
    to G3Fax, the body is created in the following way:\n      (1)   Any trailing
    EOL markers on each bitstring is removed. The\n            bit order is changed
    to conform to the most common Internet\n            encoding (highest bit of first
    byte = first bit of the\n            G3Fax). The bitstring is padded to a byte
    boundary.\n      (2)   6 consecutive EOL markers are appended to each bitstring.\n
    \     (3)   The padded bitstrings are concatenated together\n   An EOL marker
    is the bit sequence 000000000001 (11 zeroes and a\n   one).\n   From G3Fax to
    X.400, the body is created in the following way:\n      (1)   The body is split
    into bitstrings at each occurrence of 6\n            consecutive EOL markers.
    Trailing EOLs must NOT be removed,\n            since the X.400 Implementor Guide
    recommends that each page\n            should end with 6 consecutive EOLs.  (This
    is a change from\n            RFC 1494).\n      (2)   Each bitstring is made into
    an ASN.1 BITSTRING, reversing\n            the order of bits within each byte
    to conforom to the X.400\n            Implementors Guide recommendation for bit
    order in the\n            G3Fax body part.\n      (3)   The bitstrings are made
    into an ASN.1 SEQUENCE, which forms\n            the body of the G3Fax body part.\n"

  - "4.  Usability of G3Fax body parts\n   This section is not part of the proposed
    standard, but is intended as\n   guidance for people implementing G3Fax handling,
    so that they know a\n   little about what to expect.\n   The DCS bitstring is
    a LONG thing; the T.30 Recommendation (1993)\n   gives 67 bits with specific functions,
    SG8 Report R33 extends this to\n   75 bits, and Report R41 (approved in 1995)
    extends it to 79 bits.\n   (For curiosity - bit 68 says that the coding is JPEG;
    bit 27 is\n   \"error correcting mode). No sane implementor will send such things\n
    \  without being able to negotiate them down if the recipient doesn't\n   support
    it, but there is no guarantee that messages with such bits\n   set in the DCS
    won't arrive through X.400.\n   The ISO P2 profile from 1995 [PROFILE] says that
    the profile makes\n   support for reception of two-dimensional and fine-resolution\n
    \  mandatory if g3-facsimile is supported at all. Research by Andrew\n   Gordon
    of Net-Tel indicates that it is easy for an access unit to\n   support fine resolution,
    unlimited length and B4 length, while\n   support for B4 width is nearly impossible,
    and A3 width is hard.\n   Another interesting point is that some fax machines
    have trouble if\n   the scan lines do not contain exactly the declared number
    of pixels\n   on each scan line, so \"omitting right-hand white space\" is likely
    to\n   give trouble.\n"
