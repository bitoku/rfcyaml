  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobile IPv6 Fast Handover protocol (FMIPv6) [RFC5268] was\
    \ proposed to\n   complement the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC3775] by reducing the\
    \ handover\n   latency for the real-time traffic.  FMIPv6 assumes the support\
    \ from\n   the link-layer technology; however, the specific link-layer\n   information\
    \ available and its available timing differs according to\n   the particular link-layer\
    \ technology in use, as pointed out in\n   [RFC4260], which provides an FMIPv6\
    \ solution for the IEEE 802.11\n   networks.  So, this document is proposed to\
    \ provide an informational\n   guide to the developers about how to optimize the\
    \ FMIPv6 handover\n   procedures, specifically in the IEEE 802.16e networks\n\
    \   [IEEE802.16][IEEE802.16e].\n   The proposed scheme achieves seamless handover\
    \ by exploiting the\n   link-layer handover indicators and designing an efficient\n\
    \   interleaving scheme of the 802.16e and the FMIPv6 handover\n   procedures.\
    \  The scheme targets a hard handover, which is the default\n   handover type\
    \ of IEEE 802.16e.  For the other handover types, i.e.,\n   the Macro Diversity\
    \ Handover (MDHO) and Fast Base Station Switching\n   (FBSS), the base stations\
    \ in the same diversity set are likely to\n   belong to the same subnet for diversity,\
    \ and FMIPv6 might not be\n   needed.  Regarding the MDHO and the FBSS deployment\
    \ with FMIPv6,\n   further discussion will be needed and is not in the scope of\
    \ this\n   document.\n   We begin with a summary of handover procedures of [IEEE802.16e]\
    \ and\n   then present the optimized complete FMIPv6 handover procedures by\n\
    \   using the link-layer handover indicators.  The examples of handover\n   scenarios\
    \ are described for both the predictive mode and reactive\n   mode.\n"

- title: 3.  IEEE 802.16e Handover Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  IEEE 802.16e Handover Overview\n   Compared with the handover in the WLAN\
    \ (Wireless Local Area Network),\n   the IEEE 802.16e handover mechanism consists\
    \ of more steps since the\n   802.16e embraces the functionality for elaborate\
    \ parameter adjustment\n   and procedural flexibility.\n   When a mobile node\
    \ (MN) stays in a link, it listens to the Layer 2\n   neighbor advertisement messages,\
    \ named MOB_NBR-ADV, from its serving\n   base station (BS).  A BS broadcasts\
    \ them periodically to identify the\n   network and announce the characteristics\
    \ of neighbor BSs.  Receiving\n   this, the MN decodes this message to find out\
    \ information about the\n   parameters of neighbor BSs for its future handover.\
    \  With the\n   provided information in a MOB_NBR-ADV, the MN may minimize the\n\
    \   handover latency by obtaining the channel number of neighbors and\n   reducing\
    \ the scanning time, or may select the better target BS based\n   on the signal\
    \ strength, Quality-of-Service (QoS) level, service\n   price, etc.\n   The handover\
    \ procedure is conceptually divided into two steps:\n   \"handover preparation\"\
    \ and \"handover execution\" [SH802.16e].  The\n   handover preparation can be\
    \ initiated by either an MN or a BS.\n   During this period, neighbors are compared\
    \ by the metrics such as\n   signal strength or QoS parameters, and a target BS\
    \ is selected among\n   them.  If necessary, the MN may try to associate (initial\
    \ ranging)\n   with candidate BSs to expedite a future handover.  Once the MN\n\
    \   decides to handover, it notifies its intent by sending a MOB_MSHO-REQ\n  \
    \ message to the serving BS (s-BS).  The BS then replies with a\n   MOB_BSHO-RSP\
    \ containing the recommended BSs to the MN after\n   negotiating with candidates.\
    \  Optionally, it may confirm handover to\n   the target BS (t-BS) over backbone\
    \ when the target is decided.\n   Alternatively, the BS may trigger handover with\
    \ a MOB_BSHO-REQ\n   message.\n   After handover preparation, handover execution\
    \ starts.  The MN sends\n   a MOB_HO-IND message to the serving BS as a final\
    \ indication of its\n   handover.  Once it makes a new attachment, it conducts\
    \ 802.16e\n   ranging through which it can acquire physical parameters from the\n\
    \   target BS, tuning its parameters to the target BS.  After ranging\n   with\
    \ the target BS successfully, the MN negotiates basic capabilities\n   such as\
    \ maximum transmit power and modulator/demodulator type.  It\n   then performs\
    \ authentication and key exchange procedures, and finally\n   registers with the\
    \ target BS.  If the target BS has already learned\n   some contexts such as authentication\
    \ or capability parameters through\n   backbone, it may omit the corresponding\
    \ procedures.  For the details\n   of the 802.16 handover procedures, refer to\
    \ Section 6.3.22 of\n   [IEEE802.16e].  After completing registration, the target\
    \ BS starts\n   to serve the MN and communication via target BS is available.\n\
    \   However, in case the MN moves to a different subnet, it should\n   reconfigure\
    \ a new IP address and reestablish an IP connection.  To\n   resume the active\
    \ session of the previous link, the MN should also\n   perform IP layer handover.\n"
- title: 4.  Network Topology Acquisition and Network Selection
  contents:
  - "4.  Network Topology Acquisition and Network Selection\n   This section describes\
    \ how discovery of adjacent networks and\n   selection of target network work\
    \ in the IEEE 802.16e for background\n   information.\n   An MN can learn the\
    \ network topology and acquire the link information\n   in several ways.  First\
    \ of all, it can do that via L2 neighbor\n   advertisements.  A BS supporting\
    \ mobile functionality shall broadcast\n   a MOB_NBR-ADV message periodically\
    \ that includes the network topology\n   information (its maximum interval is\
    \ 1 second).  This message\n   includes BSIDs and channel information of neighbor\
    \ BSs, and it is\n   used to facilitate the MN's synchronization with neighbor\
    \ BSs.  An MN\n   can collect the necessary information of the neighbor BSs through\n\
    \   this message for its future handover.\n   Another method for acquisition of\
    \ network topology is scanning, which\n   is the process to seek and monitor available\
    \ BSs in order to find\n   suitable handover targets.  While a MOB_NBR-ADV message\
    \ includes\n   static information about neighbor BSs, scanning provides rather\n\
    \   dynamic parameters such as link quality parameters.  Since the\n   MOB_NBR-ADV\
    \ message delivers a list of neighbor BSIDs periodically\n   and scanning provides\
    \ a way to sort out some adequate BSs, it is\n   recommended that when new BSs\
    \ are found in the advertisement, the MN\n   identifies them via scanning and\
    \ resolves their BSIDs to the\n   information of the subnet where the BS is connected.\
    \  The\n   association, an optional initial ranging procedure occurring during\n\
    \   scanning, is one of the helpful methods to facilitate the impending\n   handover.\
    \  The MN is able to get ranging parameters and service\n   availability information\
    \ for the purpose of proper selection of the\n   target BS and expediting a potential\
    \ future handover to it.  The\n   detailed explanation of association is described\
    \ in Section 6.3.22 of\n   [IEEE802.16e].\n   Besides the methods provided by\
    \ 802.16e, the MN may rely on other\n   schemes.  For instance, the topology information\
    \ may be provided\n   through the MIIS (Media Independent Information Service)\n\
    \   [IEEE802.21], which has been developed by the IEEE 802.21 working\n   group.\
    \  The MIIS is a framework by which the MN or network can obtain\n   network information\
    \ to facilitate network selection and handovers.\n   After learning about neighbors,\
    \ the MN may compare them to find a BS,\n   which can serve better than the serving\
    \ BS.  The target BS may be\n   determined by considering various criteria such\
    \ as required QoS,\n   cost, user preference, and policy.  How to select the target\
    \ BS is\n   not in the scope of this document.\n"

  - "5.  Interaction between FMIPv6 and IEEE 802.16e\n   In this section, a set of\
    \ primitives is introduced for an efficient\n   interleaving of the IEEE 802.16e\

- title: 5.1.  Access Router Discovery
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Access Router Discovery\n   Once a new BS is detected through reception\
    \ of a MOB_NBR-ADV and\n   scanning, an MN may try to learn the associated access\
    \ router (AR)\n   information as soon as possible.  In order to enable its quick\n\
    \   discovery in the IP layer, the link layer (802.16) triggers a\n   NEW_LINK_DETECTED\
    \ primitive to the IP layer (FMIPv6) on detecting a\n   new BS.\n   Receiving\
    \ the NEW_LINK_DETECTED from the link layer, the IP layer\n   tries to learn the\
    \ associated AR information by exchanging an RtSolPr\n   (Router Solicitation\
    \ for Proxy Advertisement) and a PrRtAdv (Proxy\n   Router Advertisement) with\
    \ the PAR (Previous Access Router).\n   According to [RFC5268], the MN may send\
    \ an RtSolPr at any convenient\n   time.  However, this proposal recommends that,\
    \ if feasible, the MN\n   send it as soon as possible after receiving the NEW_LINK_DETECTED\
    \ for\n   quick router discovery because detection of a new BS usually implies\n\
    \   MN's movement, which may result in handover.\n   Transmission of RtSolPr messages\
    \ may cause the signaling overhead\n   problem that is mentioned in Section 2\
    \ of [RFC4907].  To rate-limit\n   the retransmitted RtSolPr messages, FMIPv6\
    \ provides a back-off\n   mechanism.  It is also possible that attackers may forge\
    \ a MOB_NBR-\n   ADV message so that it can contain a bunch of bogus BSIDs or\
    \ may send\n   a flood of MOB_NBR-ADV messages each of which contains different\n\
    \   BSIDs.  This problem is mentioned in Section 8.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Handover Preparation
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Handover Preparation\n   When the MN decides to change links based on its\
    \ policy such as the\n   degrading signal strength or increasing packet loss rate,\
    \ it\n   initiates handover by sending a MOB_MSHO-REQ to the BS and will\n   receive\
    \ a MOB_BSHO-RSP from the BS as a response.  Alternatively, the\n   BS may initiate\
    \ handover by sending a MOB_BSHO-REQ to the MN.\n   On receiving either a MOB_BSHO-RSP\
    \ or a MOB_BSHO-REQ, the link layer\n   triggers a LINK_HANDOVER_IMPEND in order\
    \ to signal the IP layer of\n   arrival of MOB_BSHO-REQ/MOB_BSHO-RSP quickly.\
    \  At this time, the\n   target BS decided in the link layer is delivered to the\
    \ IP layer as a\n   parameter of the primitive.  The primitive is used to report\
    \ that a\n   link-layer handover decision has been made and its execution is\n\
    \   imminent.  It can be helpfully used for FMIPv6 as an indication to\n   start\
    \ the handover preparation procedure, that is to send an FBU\n   (Fast Binding\
    \ Update) message to the PAR.\n   To avoid erroneous results due to unreliable\
    \ and inconsistent\n   characteristics of link, for instance, to move to the unpredicted\n\
    \   network or to stay in the current network after sending an FBU,\n   Section\
    \ 2 of [RFC4907] advises the use of a combination of signal\n   strength data\
    \ with other techniques rather than relying only on\n   signal strength for handover\
    \ decision.  For example, the\n   LINK_HANDOVER_IMPEND may be sent after validating\
    \ filtered signal\n   strength measurements with other indications of link loss\
    \ such as\n   lack of beacon reception.\n   Once the IP layer receives the LINK_HANDOVER_IMPEND,\
    \ it checks\n   whether or not the specified target network belongs to a different\n\
    \   subnet based on the information collected during the Access Router\n   Discovery\
    \ step.  If the target proves to be in the same subnet, the\n   MN can continue\
    \ to use the current IP address after handover, and\n   there is no need to perform\
    \ FMIPv6.  Otherwise, the IP layer\n   formulates a prospective NCoA (New Care-of\
    \ Address) with the\n   information provided in the PrRtAdv message and sends\
    \ an FBU message\n   to the PAR.\n   When the FBU message arrives in the PAR successfully,\
    \ the PAR and the\n   NAR (New Access Router) process it according to [RFC5268].\
    \  The PAR\n   sets up a tunnel between the PCoA (Previous Care-of Address) and\
    \ NCoA\n   by exchanging HI (Handover Initiate) and HAck (Handover Acknowledge)\n\
    \   messages with the NAR, forwarding the packets destined for the MN to\n   the\
    \ NCoA.  The NCoA is confirmed or re-assigned by the NAR in the\n   HAck and,\
    \ finally delivered to the MN through the FBack (Fast Binding\n   Acknowledgment)\
    \ in case of predictive mode.\n   After the MN sends a MOB_HO-IND to the serving\
    \ BS, data packet\n   transfer between the MN and the BS is no longer allowed.\
    \  Note that\n   when a MOB_HO-IND is sent out before an FBack arrives in the\
    \ MN, it\n   is highly probable that the MN will operate in reactive mode because\n\
    \   the serving BS releases all the MN's connections and resources after\n   receiving\
    \ a MOB_HO-IND.  Therefore, if possible, the MN should\n   exchange FBU and FBack\
    \ messages with the PAR before sending a MOB_HO-\n   IND to the BS so as to operate\
    \ in predictive mode.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Handover Execution
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Handover Execution\n   If the MN receives an FBack message on the previous\
    \ link, it runs in\n   predictive mode after handover.  Otherwise, it should run\
    \ in reactive\n   mode.  In order for the MN to operate in predictive mode as\
    \ far as\n   possible after handover, implementations may allow use of a\n   LINK_SWITCH\
    \ primitive.  The LINK_SWITCH is a command in order to\n   force the MN to switch\
    \ from an old BS to a new BS and the similar\n   concept has introduced for the\
    \ wireless LAN in [RFC5184].  When it is\n   applied, the MN's IP layer issues\
    \ a LINK_SWITCH primitive to the link\n   layer on receiving the FBack message\
    \ in the previous link.  Until it\n   occurs, the link layer keeps the current\
    \ (previous) link if feasible\n   and postpones sending a MOB_HO-IND message while\
    \ waiting for the\n   FBack message.\n   After switching links, the MN synchronizes\
    \ with the target BS and\n   performs the 802.16e network entry procedure.  The\
    \ MN exchanges the\n   RNG-REQ/RSP, SBC-REQ/RSP, PKM-REQ/RSP, and REG-REQ/RSP\
    \ messages with\n   the target BS.  Some of these messages may be omitted if the\n\
    \   (previously) serving BS transferred the context to the target BS over\n  \
    \ the backbone beforehand.  When the network entry procedure is\n   completed\
    \ and the link layer is ready for data transmission, it\n   informs the IP layer\
    \ of the fact with a LINK_UP primitive.\n   Section 2 of [RFC4907] recommends\
    \ that link indications should be\n   designed with built-in damping.  The LINK_UP\
    \ primitive defined in\n   this document is generated by the link layer state\
    \ machine based on\n   the 802.16e link layer message exchanges, that is, the\
    \ IEEE 802.16e\n   network entry and the service flow creation procedures.  Therefore,\n\
    \   the LINK_UP is typically less sensitive to changes in transient link\n   conditions.\
    \  The link may experience an intermittent loss.  Even in\n   such a case, the\
    \ following FMIPv6 operation is performed only when\n   the MN handovers to the\
    \ link with a different subnet and there is no\n   signaling overhead as a result\
    \ of a intermittent loss.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.4.  Handover Completion\n   When the MN's IP layer receives a LINK_UP primitive\
    \ from the link\n   layer, it should check whether it has moved into the target\
    \ network\n   predicted by FMIPv6.  In case the target BS is within the same\n\
    \   subnet, the MN does not perform the FMIPv6 operation.\n      *  If the MN\
    \ discovers itself in the predicted target network and\n         receives an FBack\
    \ message in the previous link, the MN's IP\n         layer sends an UNA (Unsolicited\
    \ Neighbor Advertisement) to the\n         NAR (predictive mode).\n      *  If\
    \ the MN has moved to the target network without receiving an\n         FBack\
    \ message in the previous link, the IP layer sends an UNA\n         and also an\
    \ FBU message immediately after sending the UNA\n         message (reactive mode).\
    \  The NAR may provide a different IP\n         address by using an RA (Router\

    \ in the\n         LINK_HANDOVER_IMPEND primitive.  For the recovery from such\
    \ an\n         invalid indication, which is mentioned in Section 2 of\n      \
    \   [RFC4907], the MN should send a new FBU to the PAR according to\n        \
    \ Section 5.6 of [RFC5268] so that the PAR can update the\n         existing binding\

- title: 6.1.  Predictive Mode
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Predictive Mode\n   The handover procedures in the predictive mode are\
    \ briefly described\n   as follows.  Figure 3 illustrates these procedures.\n\
    \      1.   A BS broadcasts a MOB_NBR-ADV periodically.\n      2.   If the MN\
    \ discovers a new neighbor BS in this message, it may\n           perform scanning\
    \ for the BS.\n      3.   When a new BS is found through the MOB_NBR-ADV and scanning,\n\
    \           the MN's link layer notifies it to the IP layer by a\n           NEW_LINK_DETECTED\
    \ primitive.\n      4.   The MN tries to resolve the new BS's BSID to the associated\n\
    \           AR by exchange of RtSolPr and PrRtAdv messages with the PAR.\n   \
    \   5.   The MN initiates handover by sending a MOB_MSHO-REQ message\n       \
    \    to the BS and receives a MOB_BSHO-RSP from the BS.\n           Alternatively,\
    \ the BS may initiate handover by sending a\n           MOB_BSHO-REQ to the MN.\n\
    \      6.   When the MN receives either a MOB_BSHO-RSP or a MOB_BSHO-REQ\n   \
    \        from the BS, its link layer triggers a LINK_HANDOVER_IMPEND\n       \
    \    primitive to the IP layer.\n      7.   On reception of the LINK_HANDOVER_IMPEND,\
    \ the MN's IP layer\n           identifies that the target delivered along with\
    \ the\n           LINK_HANDOVER_IMPEND belongs to a different subnet and sends\n\
    \           an FBU message to the PAR.  On receiving this message, the\n     \
    \      PAR establishes tunnel between the PCoA and the NCoA by\n           exchange\
    \ of HI and HAck messages with the NAR, and it\n           forwards packets destined\
    \ for the MN to the NCoA.  During\n           this time, the NAR may confirm NCoA\
    \ availability in the new\n           link via HAck.\n      8.   The MN receives\
    \ the FBack message before its handover and\n           sends a MOB_HO-IND message\
    \ as a final indication of handover.\n           Issue of a MOB_HO-IND may be\
    \ promoted optionally by using a\n           LINK_SWITCH command from the IP layer.\
    \  Afterwards it\n           operates in predictive mode in the new link.\n  \
    \    9.   The MN conducts handover to the target BS and performs the\n       \
    \    IEEE 802.16e network entry procedure.\n      10.  As soon as the network\
    \ entry procedure is completed, the MN's\n           link layer signals the IP\
    \ layer with a LINK_UP.  On receiving\n           this, the IP layer identifies\
    \ that it has moved to a\n           predicted target network and received the\
    \ FBack message in\n           the previous link.  It issues an UNA to the NAR\
    \ by using the\n           NCoA as a source IP address.  At the same time, it\
    \ starts to\n           perform DAD for the NCoA.\n      11.  When the NAR receives\

  contents:
  - "7.  IEEE 802.21 Considerations\n   It is worth noting that great research has\
    \ been conducted on defining\n   generic services in the IEEE 802.21 working group\
    \ that facilitate\n   handovers between heterogeneous access links.  The standard\
    \ works are\n   named as a Media Independent Handover (MIH) Service [IEEE802.21],\
    \ and\n   propose three kinds of services: Media Independent Event Service\n \
    \  (MIES), Media Independent Command Service (MICS), and Media\n   Independent\
    \ Information Service (MIIS).\n   An MIES defines the events triggered from lower\
    \ layers (physical and\n   link) to higher layers (network and above) in order\
    \ to report changes\n   of physical and link-layer conditions.  On the other hand,\
    \ an MICS\n   supports the commands sent from higher layers to lower layers, and\
    \ it\n   provides users with a way of managing the link behavior relevant to\n\
    \   handovers and mobility.  An MIIS provides a framework by which the MN\n  \
    \ or network can obtain network information to facilitate network\n   selection\
    \ and handovers.\n   Although the purpose of IEEE 802.21 has been developed to\
    \ enhance the\n   user experience of MNs roaming between heterogeneous networks,\
    \ the\n   results may be utilized to optimize the handover performance in a\n\
    \   homogeneous network.  When the MIH primitives are available for\n   handover\
    \ in the 802.16e network, the MN can use them instead of the\n   primitives proposed\
    \ in this document.  Table 1 shows examples of the\n   mapping between the proposed\

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The primitives defined in this document are used\
    \ only for local\n   indication inside of the MN, so no security mechanism is\
    \ required to\n   protect those primitives.  However, FMIPv6 messages and IEEE\
    \ 802.16e\n   messages, which may trigger the primitives, need to be protected.\n\
    \   Security considerations of the FMIPv6 specification [RFC5268] are\n   applicable\
    \ to this document.  It is also worthwhile to note that the\n   IEEE802.16e has\
    \ a security sub-layer that provides subscribers with\n   privacy and authentication\
    \ over the broadband wireless network.  This\n   layer has two main component\
    \ protocols: a privacy key management\n   protocol (PKM) for key management and\
    \ authentication and an\n   encapsulation protocol for encrypting data.  From\
    \ the perspective of\n   the 802.16e, FMIPv6 messages are considered as data and\
    \ are delivered\n   securely by using those protocols.\n   However, some of IEEE\
    \ 802.16e management messages are sent without\n   authentication.  For example,\
    \ there is no protection to secure\n   802.16e broadcast messages.  It may be\
    \ possible for the attacker to\n   maliciously forge a MOB_NBR-ADV message so\
    \ that it contains the bogus\n   BSIDs, or send a flood of MOB_NBR-ADV messages\
    \ having different bogus\n   BSIDs toward the MN.  As a result, the MN may trigger\
    \ a bunch of\n   NEW_LINK_DETECTED primitives and send useless consecutive RtSolPr\n\
    \   messages to the PAR, finally resulting in wasting the air resources.\n   Therefore,\
    \ the MN SHOULD perform scanning when detecting new BSs in\n   the received MOB_NBR-ADV\
    \ messages in order to assure the included\n   neighbor information.\n   It is\
    \ also possible that attackers try a DoS (Denial-of-Service)\n   attack by sending\
    \ a flood of MOB_BSHO-REQ messages and triggering\n   LINK_HANDOVER_IMPEND primitives\
    \ in the MN.  But the IEEE 802.16e\n   provides a message authentication scheme\
    \ for management messages\n   involved in handover as well as network entry procedures\
    \ by using a\n   message authentication code (MAC) such as HMAC/CMAC (hashed/cipher\n\
    \   MAC).  Thus, those management messages are protected from the\n   malicious\
    \ use by attackers who intend to trigger LINK_HANDOVER_IMPEND\n   or LINK_UP primitives\
    \ in the MN.\n"
