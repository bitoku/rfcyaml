1.  Command name and code.
IAC WILL SUPDUP The sender of this command  REQUESTS permission to, or  confirms that it will, use the SUPDUP display protocol IAC
The sender of this command REFUSES to use the SUPDUP protocol.
The sender of this  command REQUESTS that  the receiver use,  or grants the receiver permission to use, the SUPDUP protocol.
The sender of this command DEMANDS that the receiver not use the SUPDUP protocol.
SUPDUP DON'T SUPDUP i.e., the SUPDUP display protocol is not in use.
Since the publication of RFC 734,  I have been requested to  design an option to  the TELNET  protocol to provide  for SUPDUP  service.
This option allows a host to  provide SUPDUP service on the  normal TELNET socket (27 octal) instead of 137 (octal) which is the normal SUPDUP ICP socket.
A user  TELNET  program which  wishes  to use  the  SUPDUP  display protocol instead of the NVT terminal service should send an IAC  DO SUPDUP.
If  the  server  is  willing to  use  the  SUPDUP  display protocol, it  should respond  with IAC  WILL SUPDUP;  otherwise  it should refuse with IAC WONT SUPDUP.
For hosts  which normally  provide  SUPDUP terminal  services,  the server can send IAC  WILL SUPDUP upon ICP
which the user may  then accept or refuse.
If the SUPDUP option is  in effect, no further TELNET  negotiations are allowed.
They  are  meaningless, since  SUPDUP  has  its  own facilities to perform  the functions that are needed.
Hence, octal 377 will become an ordinary transmitted character (in this case  an invalid %TD code) instead of an IAC.
Following the mutual  acceptance of the  SUPDUP option, the  SUPDUP negotiation proceeds as described in RFC 734.
