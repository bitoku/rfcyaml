- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is intended to provide updated information\
    \ on the\n   registration of the MIME Media Type \"application/pdf\" for documents\n\
    \   in the PDF (Portable Document Format) syntax.  It obsoletes\n   [RFC3778].\n\
    \   PDF was originally envisioned as a way to reliably communicate and\n   view\
    \ printed information electronically across a wide variety of\n   machine configurations,\
    \ operating systems, and communication\n   networks.\n   PDF is used to represent\
    \ \"final form\" formatted documents.  PDF pages\n   may include text, images,\
    \ graphics, and multimedia content such as\n   video and audio.  PDF is also capable\
    \ of containing auxiliary\n   structures, including annotations, bookmarks, file\
    \ attachments,\n   hyperlinks, logical structures, and metadata.  These features\
    \ are\n   useful for navigation and building collections of related documents,\n\
    \   as well as for reviewing and commenting on documents.  A rich\n   JavaScript\
    \ model has been defined for interacting with PDF documents.\n   The imaging model\
    \ for PDF was originally based on the PostScript [PS]\n   page description language,\
    \ used to render complex text, images, and\n   graphics in a device-independent\
    \ and resolution-independent manner.\n   PDF supports encryption and digital signatures.\
    \  The encryption\n   capability is combined with access control information to\
    \ facilitate\n   management of the functionality available to the recipient. \
    \ PDF\n   supports the inclusion of document and object-level metadata through\n\
    \   the eXtensible Metadata Platform [XMP].\n"
- title: 2.  History
  contents:
  - "2.  History\n   PDF is used widely in the Internet community.  The first version\
    \ of\n   PDF, 1.0, was published in 1993 by Adobe Systems Incorporated.  Since\n\
    \   then, PDF has grown to be a widely used format for capturing and\n   exchanging\
    \ formatted documents electronically across the Web, via\n   email and virtually\
    \ every other document-exchange mechanism.  In\n   2008, PDF 1.7 was adopted as\
    \ an ISO standard (ISO 32000-1:2008\n   [ISOPDF]) using the ISO \"Fast-Track\"\
    \ process.  That specification is\n   technically identical to Adobe Portable\
    \ Document Format version 1.7\n   [AdobePDF].\n   The ISO TC-171 committee developed\
    \ a \"refresh\" of PDF, known as\n   ISO 32000-2; the version is PDF 2.0 [ISOPDF2].\n\
    \   In addition to ISO 32000-1:2008 and ISO 32000-2, several subset\n   standards\
    \ have been defined to address specific use cases and\n   standardized by the\
    \ ISO.  These standards include PDF for Archival\n   (PDF/A) [ISOPDFA], PDF for\
    \ Engineering (PDF/E) [ISOPDFE], PDF for\n   Universal Accessibility (PDF/UA)\
    \ [ISOPDFUA], PDF for Variable Data\n   and Transactional Printing (PDF/VT) [ISOPDFVT],\
    \ and PDF for Prepress\n   Digital Data Exchange (PDF/X) [ISOPDFX].  The subset\
    \ standards are\n   fully compliant PDF files capable of being displayed in a\
    \ general PDF\n   viewer.\n"
- title: 3.  Fragment Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.  Fragment Identifiers\n   Fragment identifiers appear at the end of a URI\
    \ and provide a way to\n   reference an anchor to subordinate content within the\
    \ target of the\n   URI, or additional parameters to the process of opening the\n\
    \   identified content.  The syntax and semantics of fragment identifiers\n  \
    \ are referenced in the media type definition.\n   The specification of fragment\
    \ identifiers for PDF appeared originally\n   in [RFC3778] and is now included\
    \ in ISO 32000-2 [ISOPDF2].  This\n   section is a summary of that material. \
    \ Any disagreements between\n   [ISOPDF2] and this document should be resolved\
    \ in favor of the\n   ISO 32000-2 definition.\n   A fragment identifier for PDF\
    \ has one or more parameters, separated\n   by the ampersand (&) or pound (#)\
    \ character.  Each parameter consists\n   of the parameter name, \"=\" (equal),\
    \ and the parameter value; lists of\n   values are comma-separated, and parameter\
    \ value strings may be\n   URI-encoded [RFC3986].  Parameters are processed left\
    \ to right.\n   Coordinate values (such as <left>, <right>, and <width>) are\n\
    \   expressed in the default user space coordinate system of the\n   document:\
    \ 1/72 of an inch measured down and to the right from the\n   upper left corner\
    \ of the (current) page ([ISOPDF2] 8.3.2.3\n   \"User Space\").\n   The following\
    \ parameters identify subordinate content of a PDF file\n   but also may be used\
    \ to set the document view to make the (start of)\n   the identified content visible:\n\
    \   page=<pageNum>\n      Identifies a specified (physical) page; the first page\
    \ in the\n      document has a pageNum value of 1.\n   nameddest=<name>\n    \
    \  Identifies a named destination ([ISOPDF2] 12.3.2.4 \"Named\n      destinations\"\
    ).\n   structelem=<structID>\n      A byte string with URI encoding; identifies\
    \ the structure element\n      with the ID key within a StructElem dictionary\
    \ of the document.\n   comment=<commentID>\n      The value of an annotation name,\
    \ which is defined by the NM key in\n      the corresponding annotation dictionary\
    \ of the selected page\n      ([ISOPDF2] 12.5.2 \"Annotation dictionaries\").\n\
    \   ef=<name>\n      Identifies the embedded file where the parameter string <name>\n\
    \      matches a file specification dictionary in the EmbeddedFiles name\n   \
    \   tree.  If the \"ef\" parameter is not at the end of the fragment\n      identifier,\
    \ then the rest of the fragment identifier (after the\n      ampersand or hash\
    \ delimiter) is applied to the embedded file\n      according to its own media\
    \ type.  This allows identification of\n      content within the embedded file\
    \ (which itself might be a\n      PDF file).\n      NOTE: When attempting to open\
    \ a PDF file that is not from a\n      trusted source, the processor may choose\
    \ to prompt the user or\n      even prevent the file from being opened.\n   These\
    \ parameters operate on the view of the PDF document when it is\n   opened:\n\
    \   zoom=<scale>,<left>,<top>\n      <scale> is the percentage to which the document\
    \ should be zoomed,\n      where a value of 100 corresponds to a zoom of 100%.\
    \  <left> and\n      <top> are optional, but both must be specified if either\
    \ is\n      included.\n   view=<keyword>,<position>\n      The arguments correspond\
    \ to those found in [ISOPDF2] 12.3.2.2\n      \"Explicit destinations\".  <keyword>\
    \ is one of the keywords defined\n      in [ISOPDF2] \"Table 149: Destination\
    \ syntax\" with appropriate\n      position values.\n   viewrect=<left>,<top>,<width>,<height>\n\
    \      Set the view rectangle.\n   highlight=<left>,<right>,<top>,<bottom>\n \
    \     Highlight the specified rectangle.\n   search=<wordList>\n      Open the\
    \ document and search for one or more words, selecting the\n      first matching\
    \ word in the document.  <wordList> is a string\n      enclosed in quotation marks,\
    \ where individual words are separated\n      by the space character (or %20).\n\
    \   fdf=<URI>\n      This parameter imports data into PDF form fields.  The URI\
    \ is\n      either a relative or absolute URI to a Forms Data Format (FDF) or\n\
    \      XML FDF (XFDF) file.  The fdf parameter should be specified as the\n  \
    \    last parameter to a given URI.\n"
- title: 4.  Subset Standards
  contents:
  - "4.  Subset Standards\n   Several subsets of PDF have been published as distinct\
    \ ISO standards:\n   o  PDF/X [ISOPDFX], initially released in 2001 as PDF/X-1a,\
    \ specifies\n      how to use PDF for graphics exchange, with the aim to facilitate\n\
    \      correct and predictable printing by print service providers.  The\n   \
    \   standard has gone through multiple revisions over the years and\n      has\
    \ several published parts, the most recently released being\n      part 8, specifying\
    \ different levels of conformance: PDF/X-1a:2001,\n      PDF/X-3:2002, PDF/X-1a:2003,\
    \ PDF/X-3:2003, PDF/X-4, PDF/X-4p,\n      PDF/X-5g, PDF/X-5pg, and PDF/X-5n.\n\
    \   o  PDF/A [ISOPDFA], initially released in 2005, specifies how to use\n   \
    \   PDF for long-term preservation (archiving) of electronic\n      documents.\
    \  It prohibits PDF features that are not well suited to\n      long-term archiving\
    \ of documents, including JavaScript or\n      executable file launches.  Its\
    \ requirements for PDF/A viewers\n      include color management guidelines and\
    \ support for embedded\n      fonts.  There are three parts of this standard and\
    \ a total of\n      eight conformance levels: PDF/A-1a, PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-2a, PDF/A-2b,\n\
    \      PDF/A-2u, PDF/A-3a, PDF/A-3b, and PDF/A-3u.\n   o  PDF/E, initially released\
    \ in 2008 as PDF/E-1 [ISOPDFE], specifies\n      how to use PDF in engineering\
    \ workflows, such as manufacturing,\n      construction, and geospatial analysis.\
    \  Future revisions of PDF/E\n      are supposed to include support for 3D PDF\
    \ workflows.\n   o  PDF/VT, initially released in 2010, specifies how to use PDF\
    \ in\n      variable and transactional printing.  It is based on PDF/X and\n \
    \     places additional restrictions on PDF content elements and\n      supporting\
    \ metadata.  It specifies three conformance levels:\n      PDF/VT-1, PDF/VT-2,\
    \ and PDF/VT-2s [ISOPDFVT].\n   o  PDF/UA [ISOPDFUA], initially released in 2012\
    \ as PDF/UA-1,\n      specifies how to create accessible electronic documents.\
    \  It\n      requires the use of ISO 32000's Tagged PDF feature and adds many\n\
    \      requirements regarding semantic correctness in applying logical\n     \
    \ structures to content in PDF documents.\n   All of these subset standards use\
    \ the \"application/pdf\" media type.\n   The subset standards are generally not\
    \ exclusive, so it is possible\n   to construct a PDF file that conforms to, for\
    \ example, both PDF/A-2b\n   and PDF/X-4 subset standards.\n   PDF documents claiming\
    \ conformance to one or more of the subset\n   standards use XMP metadata to identify\
    \ levels of conformance.  PDF\n   processors should examine document metadata\
    \ streams for such subset\n   standards identifiers and, if appropriate, label\
    \ documents as such\n   when presenting them to the user.\n"
- title: 5.  PDF Versions
  contents:
  - "5.  PDF Versions\n   The PDF format has gone through several revisions, primarily\
    \ for the\n   addition of features.  PDF features have generally been added in\
    \ a\n   way that older viewers \"fail gracefully\", because they can just\n  \
    \ ignore features they do not recognize.  Even so, the older the PDF\n   version\
    \ produced, the more legacy viewers will support that version,\n   but the fewer\
    \ features will be enabled.  The \"application/pdf\" media\n   type is used for\
    \ all versions.  See [ISOPDF2] Annex I, \"PDF Versions\n   and Compatibility\"\
    .\n"
- title: 6.  PDF Implementations
  contents:
  - "6.  PDF Implementations\n   PDF files are experienced through a reader or viewer\
    \ of PDF files.\n   For most of the common platforms in use (iOS, OS X, Windows,\
    \ Android,\n   ChromeOS, Kindle) and for most browsers (Edge, Safari, Chrome,\n\
    \   Firefox), PDF viewing is built in.  In addition, there are many PDF\n   viewers\
    \ available for download and installation.  The PDF\n   specification was published\
    \ and freely available since the format was\n   introduced in 1993, so hundreds\
    \ of companies and organizations make\n   tools for PDF creation, viewing, and\
    \ manipulation.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   PDF is certainly a complex media type as per\
    \ Section 4.6 of\n   [RFC6838], which sets requirements for security analysis\
    \ of media\n   type registrations.  [RFC3778] (which this document obsoletes)\n\
    \   contained a detailed analysis of some of the security issues for PDF\n   implementations\
    \ known at the time.  While the analysis isn't\n   necessarily wrong, the threat\
    \ analysis is much too limited, and the\n   mitigations are somewhat out of date.\
    \  There is now extensive\n   literature on security threats involving PDF implementations\
    \ and how\n   to avoid them, consistent with broad implementation over decades.\
    \  We\n   are not registering a new media type but rather are making a\n   primarily\
    \ administrative update.  With those caveats:\n   The PDF file format allows several\
    \ constructs that may compromise\n   security if handled inadequately by PDF processors.\
    \  For example:\n   o  PDF may contain scripts to customize the displaying and\
    \ processing\n      of PDF files.  These scripts are expressed in a version of\n\
    \      JavaScript and are intended for execution by the PDF processor.\n   o \
    \ A PDF file may refer to other PDF files for portions of content.\n      PDF\
    \ processors may be expected to find and use these external\n      files when\
    \ processing the document.\n   o  PDF may act as a container for various files\
    \ embedded in it (for\n      example, as attached files).  PDF processors may\
    \ offer\n      functionality to open and display such files or store them on the\n\
    \      system, such as with the \"ef\" open action.  The PDF specification\n \
    \     places no restrictions on types of files that may be embedded, so\n    \
    \  PDF processors should be extremely careful to prevent unwanted\n      execution\
    \ of attached executables or decompression of attached\n      archives that may\
    \ store dangerous files in the host file system.\n   o  PDF files may contain\
    \ links to content on the Internet.  PDF\n      processors may offer functionality\
    \ to show such content upon\n      following the link.\n   o  The fragment identifier\
    \ syntax (Section 3) contains directives for\n      opening (\"ef\") or including\
    \ (\"fdf\") additional material.\n   PDF interpreters executing any scripts or\
    \ programs related to these\n   constructs must be extremely careful to ensure\
    \ that untrusted\n   software is executed in a protected environment.\n   In addition,\
    \ the PDF processor itself, as well as its plugins,\n   scripts, etc., may be\
    \ a source of insecurity, by either obvious or\n   subtle means.\n"

  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Changes since RFC 3778\n   This specification replaces RFC 3778,\
    \ which previously defined the\n   \"application/pdf\" Media Type.  Differences\
    \ include the following:\n   o  To reflect the transition from a proprietary specification\
    \ by\n      Adobe to an open ISO standard, the Change Controller has changed\n\
    \      from Adobe to ISO, and references have been updated.\n   o  The overview\
    \ of PDF capabilities, the history of PDF, and the\n      descriptions of PDF\
    \ subsets were updated to reflect more recent\n      relevant history.\n   o \
    \ The section on fragment identifiers was updated to closely reflect\n      the\
    \ material that has been added to ISO-32000-2.\n   o  The status of popular PDF\
    \ implementations was updated.\n   o  The Security Considerations section was\
    \ updated to match the\n      current understanding of PDF vulnerabilities.\n\
    \   o  The registration template was updated to match RFC 6838.\n"
