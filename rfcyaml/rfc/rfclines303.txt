The following are three lists to be used for distribution of Network documents.
List A should be used by sites when they distribute their own documents, to get RFC's to Liaisons as quickly as possible.
All but local mail should be sent Air Mail.
Lists B and C will be used by NIC in making distribution of copies to non site Network Participants and to Station Agents.
For phone numbers and lists of names by sites see the Current Directory of Network Participants.
A. INITIAL DISTRIBUTION LIST Note:
This list includes all Network Liaisons and others who should receive initial distribution of RFC's, whether sent from NIC or from sites.
They will also receive selected catalogs and other formal documents from NIC.
