- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   Although SMTP is widely and robustly deployed, various extensions\n\
    \   have been requested by parts of the Internet community. In\n   particular,\
    \ a significant portion of the Internet community wishes to\n   exchange messages\
    \ in which the content body consists of a MIME\n   message [3] containing arbitrary\
    \ octet-aligned material. This memo\n   uses the mechanism described in [5] to\
    \ define an extension to the\n   SMTP service whereby such contents may be exchanged.\
    \ Note that this\n   extension does NOT eliminate the possibility of an SMTP server\n\
    \   limiting line length; servers are free to implement this extension\n   but\
    \ nevertheless set a line length limit no lower than 1000 octets.\n"
- title: 3.  Framework for the 8bit MIME Transport Extension
  contents:
  - "3.  Framework for the 8bit MIME Transport Extension\n   The 8bit MIME transport\
    \ extension is laid out as follows:\n          (1)  the name of the SMTP service\
    \ extension defined here is\n               8bit-MIMEtransport;\n          (2)\
    \  the EHLO keyword value associated with the extension is\n               8BITMIME;\n\
    \          (3)  no parameter is used with the 8BITMIME EHLO keyword;\n       \
    \   (4)  one optional parameter using the keyword BODY is added to\n         \
    \      the MAIL FROM command.  The value associated with this\n              \
    \ parameter is a keyword indicating whether a 7bit message\n               (in\
    \ strict compliance with [1]) or a MIME message (in\n               strict compliance\
    \ with [3]) with arbitrary octet content\n               is being sent. The syntax\
    \ of the value is as follows,\n               using the ABNF notation of [2]:\n\
    \                    body-value ::= \"7BIT\" / \"8BITMIME\"\n          (5)  no\
    \ additional SMTP verbs are defined by this extension;\n               and,\n\
    \          (6)  the next section specifies how support for the extension\n   \
    \            affects the behavior of a server and client SMTP.\n"
- title: 4.  The 8bit-MIMEtransport service extension
  contents:
  - "4.  The 8bit-MIMEtransport service extension\n   When a client SMTP wishes to\
    \ submit (using the MAIL command) a\n   content body consisting of a MIME message\
    \ containing arbitrary\n   octet-aligned material, it first issues the EHLO command\
    \ to the\n   server SMTP. If the server SMTP responds with code 250 to the EHLO\n\
    \   command, and the response includes the EHLO keyword value 8BITMIME,\n   then\
    \ the server SMTP is indicating that it supports the extended MAIL\n   command\
    \ and will accept MIME messages containing arbitrary octet-\n   aligned material.\n\
    \   The extended MAIL command is issued by a client SMTP when it wishes\n   to\
    \ transmit a content body consisting of a MIME message containing\n   arbitrary\
    \ octet-aligned material. The syntax for this command is\n   identical to the\
    \ MAIL command in [1], except that a BODY parameter\n   must appear after the\
    \ address.\n   The complete syntax of this extended command is defined in [5].\
    \ The\n   esmtp-keyword is BODY and the syntax for esmtp-value is given by the\n\
    \   syntax for body-value shown above.\n   The value associated with the BODY\
    \ parameter indicates whether the\n   content body which will be passed using\
    \ the DATA command consists of\n   a MIME message containing some arbitrary octet-aligned\
    \ material\n   (\"8BITMIME\") or is encoded entirely in accordance with [1] (\"\
    7BIT\").\n   A server which supports the 8-bit MIME transport service extension\n\
    \   shall preserve all bits in each octet passed using the DATA command.\n   Naturally,\
    \ the usual SMTP data-stuffing algorithm applies so that a\n   content which contains\
    \ the five-character sequence of\n               <CR> <LF> <DOT> <CR> <LF>\n \
    \  or a content that begins with the three-character sequence of\n           \
    \    <DOT> <CR> <LF>\n   does not prematurely terminate the transfer of the content.\
    \  Further,\n   it should be noted that the CR-LF pair immediately preceeding\
    \ the\n   final dot is considered part of the content.  Finally, although the\n\
    \   content body contains arbitrary octet-aligned material, the length of\n  \
    \ each line (number of octets between two CR-LF pairs), is still\n   subject to\
    \ SMTP server line length restrictions (which may allow as\n   few as 1000 octets\
    \ on a single line).\n   Once a server SMTP supporting the 8bit-MIMEtransport\
    \ service\n   extension accepts a content body containing octets with the high-\n\
    \   order (8th) bit set, the server SMTP must deliver or relay the\n   content\
    \ in such a way as to preserve all bits in each octet.\n   If a server SMTP does\
    \ not support the 8-bit MIME transport extension\n   (either by not responding\
    \ with code 250 to the EHLO command, or by\n   not including the EHLO keyword\
    \ value 8BITMIME in its response), then\n   the client SMTP must not, under any\
    \ circumstances, attempt to\n   transfer a content which contains characters outside\
    \ the US ASCII\n   octet range (hex 00-7F).\n   A client SMTP has two options\
    \ in this case: first,  it may implement\n   a gateway transformation to convert\
    \ the message into valid 7bit MIME,\n   or second, or may treat this as a permanent\
    \ error and handle it in\n   the usual manner for delivery failures.  The specifics\
    \ of the\n   transformation from 8bit MIME to 7bit MIME are not described by this\n\
    \   RFC; the conversion is nevertheless constrained in the following\n   ways:\n\
    \          (1)  it must cause no loss of information; MIME transport\n       \
    \        encodings must be employed as needed to insure this is\n            \
    \   the case, and\n          (2)  the resulting message must be valid 7bit MIME.\n"
