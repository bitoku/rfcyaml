    '
  - 'This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community.  Hosts on

    '
  - 'the ARPA Internet that choose to implement a Time Protocol are expected

    '
  - 'to adopt and implement this standard.

    '
  - 'This protocol provides a site-independent, machine readable date and

    '
  - 'time.  The Time service sends back to the originating source the time in

    '
  - 'seconds since midnight on January first 1900.

    '
  - 'One motivation arises from the fact that not all systems have a

    '
  - 'date/time clock, and all are subject to occasional human or machine

    '
  - 'error.  The use of time-servers makes it possible to quickly confirm or

    '
  - 'correct a system''s idea of the time, by making a brief poll of several

    '
  - 'independent sites on the network.

    '
  - 'This protocol may be used either above the Transmission Control Protocol

    '
  - '(TCP) or above the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

    '
  - "When used via TCP the time service works as follows:\n   S: Listen on port 37
    (45 octal).\n   U: Connect to port 37.\n   S: Send the time as a 32 bit binary
    number.\n   U: Receive the time.\n   U: Close the connection.\n   S: Close the
    connection.\n   The server listens for a connection on port 37.  When the connection\n
    \  is established, the server returns a 32-bit time value and closes the\n   connection.
    \ If the server is unable to determine the time at its\n   site, it should either
    refuse the connection or close it without\n   sending anything.\n"
  - "When used via UDP the time service works as follows:\n   S: Listen on port 37
    (45 octal).\n   U: Send an empty datagram to port 37.\n   S: Receive the empty
    datagram.\n   S: Send a datagram containing the time as a 32 bit binary number.\n
    \  U: Receive the time datagram.\n   The server listens for a datagram on port
    37.  When a datagram\n   arrives, the server returns a datagram containing the
    32-bit time\n   value.  If the server is unable to determine the time at its site,
    it\n   should discard the arriving datagram and make no reply.\n"
  - 'The Time

    '
  - 'The time is the number of seconds since 00:00 (midnight) 1 January 1900

    '
  - 'GMT, such that the time 1 is 12:00:01 am on 1 January 1900 GMT; this

    '
  - 'base will serve until the year 2036.

    '
  - "For example:\n   the time  2,208,988,800 corresponds to 00:00  1 Jan 1970 GMT,\n
    \            2,398,291,200 corresponds to 00:00  1 Jan 1976 GMT,\n             2,524,521,600
    corresponds to 00:00  1 Jan 1980 GMT,\n             2,629,584,000 corresponds
    to 00:00  1 May 1983 GMT,\n        and -1,297,728,000 corresponds to 00:00 17
    Nov 1858 GMT.\n"
