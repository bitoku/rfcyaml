  - "Abstract\n   This document defines the procedures for IANA to administer and\n
    \  maintain the Object Identifier (OID) tree under the Remote Monitoring\n   (rmon)
    root.  This memo also documents the currently assigned values.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RMONMIB Working Group so far has maintained its own
    registry for\n   OID assignments for new MIB modules under the root OID for rmon\n
    \  [RFC2819].  This has worked reasonably well, although errors had to\n   be
    corrected at a late stage one or two times, and a few now defunct\n   assignments
    have been made as well.\n   It is also a somewhat non-standard way of doing things,
    because\n   normally a new standards track MIB module will get a MIB root\n   assigned
    at the time that the module is being published as part of an\n   RFC.\n   This
    document lists the currently assigned rmon OIDs.  It also\n   describes the procedures
    and rules for new assignments and asks IANA\n   to take over the responsibility
    for existing and future assignments.\n   The current assignments are not all too
    logical.  Initially normal\n   MIB OIDs were assigned under rmon, but at a later
    time the WG used\n   the rmon root OID to create new MIB modules underneath it.
    \ Some\n   people will claim 'an OID is just an OID', and while this is true,
    it\n   does not make things easier if the organisation of OIDs is not\n   logical.
    \ However, we cannot change what has been assigned in the\n   past.  From now
    on, only MODULE-IDENTITY macro (MIB root) assignments\n   will be made (by IANA)
    under the 'rmon' node.  Within a MIB module,\n   the working group authors/editors
    can then assign their own OIDs\n   according to normal procedures.\n"

  - "2.  Currently assigned OIDs under the rmon root\n   At the time of this writing,
    the following OIDs have been assigned\n   and IANA has picked up this information
    in their public registry of\n   assigned values.  They are listed as part of the
    already existing\n   smi-numbers registry at:\n       http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers\n
    \      ...mib-2.rmon (1.3.6.1.2.1.16)\n   The assignments under ...mib-2.rmon
    were maintained by the RMONMIB\n   Working Group until publication of RFC 3737.
    \ Some (early)\n   assignments may not look all too logical.  That is true, but
    that is\n   history and cannot be changed.  From now on, only MODULE-IDENTITY\n
    \  macro (MIB root) assignments will be made (by IANA) under the 'rmon'\n   node.\n

  - "3.  How to request a new assignment for a MIB module\n   When anyone is writing
    a internet-draft for which a new assignment is\n   needed/wanted under the rmon
    OID, then the proper way to do so is as\n   follows:\n      EXAMPLE-MIB DEFINITIONS
    ::= BEGIN\n      IMPORTS\n        rmon          FROM RMON-MIB\n        .. other
    imports ..\n      exampleMIB  MODULE-IDENTITY\n        ... other normal MODULE-IDENTITY
    stuff ...\n      ::= { rmon nnn }  -- IANA: please assign nnn\n                        --
    RFC-Editor: replace nnn with IANA-assigned\n                        --             number
    and remove this note\n   IANA will assign the number as part of the RFC publication
    process.\n"

    \  The list is presented in Section 2.\n   IANA is requested to maintain this
    registry for future assignments.\n   New assignments can only be made via Standards
    Action as described in\n   [RFC2434].\n   IANA will assign the number as part
    of the RFC publication process.\n"
