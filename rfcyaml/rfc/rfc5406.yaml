  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Security Considerations sections of many Internet Drafts\
    \ say, in\n   effect, \"just use IPsec\".  While the use of IPsec is sometimes\
    \ the\n   correct security solution, more information is needed to provide\n \
    \  interoperable security solutions.  In some cases, IPsec is\n   unavailable\
    \ in the likely endpoints.  If IPsec is unavailable to --\n   and hence unusable\
    \ by -- a majority of the users in a particular\n   protocol environment, then\
    \ the specification of IPsec is tantamount\n   to saying \"turn off security\"\
    \ within this community.  Further, when\n   IPsec is available, the implementation\
    \ may not provide the proper\n   granularity of protection.  Finally, if IPsec\
    \ is available and\n   appropriate, the document mandating the use of IPsec needs\
    \ to specify\n   just how it is to be used.\n   The goal of this document is to\
    \ provide guidance to protocol\n   designers on the specification of IPsec when\
    \ it is the appropriate\n   security mechanism.  The protocol specification is\
    \ expected to\n   provide realistic, interoperable security.  Therefore, guidance\
    \ on\n   the configuration of the various IPsec databases, such as the\n   Security\
    \ Policy Database (SPD), is often required.\n   This document describes how to\
    \ specify the use of IPsec Version 2\n   [RFC2401] including the ESPv2 (Encapsulating\
    \ Security Payload version\n   2) [RFC2406], AHv2 (Authentication Header version\
    \ 2) [RFC2402], and\n   IKEv1 (Internet Key Exchange version 1) [RFC2409].  A\
    \ separate\n   document will describe the IPsec Version 3 suite [RFC4301] [RFC4302]\n\
    \   [RFC4303] [RFC4306].\n   For further guidance on security considerations (including\
    \ discussion\n   of IPsec), see [RFC3552].\n   NOTE: Many of the arguments below\
    \ relate to the capabilities of\n   current implementations of IPsec.  These may\
    \ change over time; this\n   advice is based on the knowledge available to the\
    \ IETF at publication\n   time.\n"
- title: 2.  WARNING
  contents:
  - "2.  WARNING\n   The design of security protocols is a subtle and difficult art.\
    \  The\n   cautions here about specifying the use of IPsec should NOT be taken\n\
    \   to mean that you should invent your own new security protocol for\n   each\
    \ new application.  If IPsec is a bad choice, using another\n   standardized,\
    \ well-understood security protocol will almost always\n   give the best results\
    \ for both implementation and deployment.\n   Security protocols are very hard\
    \ to design; rolling out a new one\n   will require extensive theoretical and\
    \ practical work to confirm its\n   security properties and will incur both delay\
    \ and uncertainty.\n"
- title: 3.  The Pieces of IPsec
  contents:
  - "3.  The Pieces of IPsec\n   IPsec is composed of a number of different pieces.\
    \  These can be used\n   to provide confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection;\
    \ though\n   some of these can be configured manually, generally a key management\n\
    \   component is used.  Additionally, the decision about whether and how\n   to\
    \ use IPsec is controlled by a policy database of some sort.\n"
- title: 3.1.  AH and ESP
  contents:
  - "3.1.  AH and ESP\n   The Authentication Header (AH) [RFC2402] and the Encapsulating\n\
    \   Security Payload (ESP) [RFC2406] are the over-the-wire security\n   protocols.\
    \  Both provide (optional) replay protection.  ESP typically\n   is used to provide\
    \ confidentiality (encryption), integrity, and\n   authentication for traffic.\
    \  ESP also can provide integrity and\n   authentication without confidentiality,\
    \ which makes it a good\n   alternative to AH in most cases where confidentiality\
    \ is not a\n   required or desired service.  Finally, ESP can be used to provide\n\
    \   confidentiality alone, although this is not recommended [Bell96].\n   The\
    \ difference in integrity protection offered by AH is that AH\n   protects portions\
    \ of the preceding IP header, including the source\n   and destination address.\
    \  However, if ESP is used in tunnel mode (see\n   Section 3.2) and integrity/authentication\
    \ is enabled, the IP header\n   seen by the source and destination hosts is completely\
    \ protected\n   anyway.\n   AH can also protect those IP options that need to\
    \ be seen by\n   intermediate routers, but must be intact and authentic when delivered\n\
    \   to the receiving system.  At this time, use (and existence) of such\n   IP\
    \ options is extremely rare.\n   If an application requires such protection, and\
    \ if the information to\n   be protected cannot be inferred from the key management\
    \ process, AH\n   must be used.  (ESP is generally regarded as easier to implement;\n\
    \   however, virtually all IPsec packages support both.)  If\n   confidentiality\
    \ is required, ESP must be used.  It is possible to use\n   AH in conjunction\
    \ with ESP, but this combination is rarely required.\n   All variants of IPsec\
    \ have problems with NAT boxes -- see [RFC3715]\n   for details -- but AH is considerably\
    \ more troublesome.  In\n   environments where there is substantial likelihood\
    \ that the two\n   endpoints will be separated by a NAT box -- this includes almost\
    \ all\n   services involving user-to-server traffic, as opposed to server-to-\n\
    \   server traffic -- NAT traversal [RFC3948] should be mandated and AH\n   should\
    \ be avoided.  (Note that [RFC3948] is for ESP only, and cannot\n   be used for\
    \ AH.)\n"
- title: 3.2.  Transport and Tunnel Mode
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Transport and Tunnel Mode\n   AH and ESP can both be used in either transport\
    \ mode or tunnel mode.\n   In tunnel mode, the IPsec header is followed by an\
    \ inner IP header.\n   This is the normal usage for Virtual Private Networks (VPN)\
    \ and is\n   generally required whenever either end of the IPsec-protected path\
    \ is\n   not the ultimate IP destination, e.g., when IPsec is implemented in a\n\
    \   firewall, router, etc.\n   Transport mode is preferred for point-to-point\
    \ communication, though\n   tunnel mode can also be used for this purpose.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Key Management
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Key Management\n   Any cryptographic system requires key management.  IPsec\
    \ provides for\n   both manual and automatic key management schemes.  Manual key\n\
    \   management is easy; however, it doesn't scale very well.  Also,\n   IPsec's\
    \ replay protection mechanisms are not available if manual key\n   management\
    \ is used.  The need for automatic key exchange is discussed\n   in more detail\
    \ in [RFC4107].\n   The primary automated key exchange mechanism for IPsec is\
    \ the\n   Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [RFC2409].  A new, simpler version of IKE\n\
    \   has been approved [RFC4306], but many existing systems still use\n   IKEv1.\
    \  This document does not discuss IKEv2 and IPsecv3.  A second\n   mechanism,\
    \ Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK) [RFC4430],\n   has been defined.\
    \  It, of course, uses Kerberos and is suitable if\n   and only if a Kerberos\
    \ infrastructure is available.\n   If a decision to use IKE is made, the precise\
    \ mode of operation must\n   be specified as well.  IKE can be used in main mode\
    \ or aggressive\n   mode; both support digital signatures, two different ways\
    \ of using\n   public key encryption, and shared secrets for authentication.\n\
    \   Shared secret authentication is simpler; however, it doesn't scale as\n  \
    \ well in many-to-many communication scenarios since each endpoint must\n   share\
    \ a unique secret with every peer with which it can communicate.\n   Note, though,\
    \ that using shared secrets in IKE is far preferable to\n   manual keying.\n \
    \  In most real-world situations where public key modes of IKE are used,\n   locally\
    \ issued certificates are employed.  That is, the administrator\n   of the system\
    \ or network concerned will issue certificates to all\n   authorized users.  These\
    \ certificates are useful only for IPsec.\n   It is sometimes possible to use\
    \ certificates [RFC5280] from an\n   existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)\
    \ with IKE.  In practice, this\n   is rare.  Furthermore, not only is there no\
    \ global PKI covering most\n   Internet endpoints, there probably never will be.\
    \  Designing a\n   structure that assumes such a PKI is a mistake.  In particular,\n\
    \   assuming that an arbitrary node will have an \"authentic\" certificate,\n\
    \   issued by a mutually trusted third party and vouching for that node's\n  \
    \ identity, is wrong.  Again, such a PKI does not and probably will not\n   exist.\
    \  Public key IKE is generally a good idea, but should almost\n   always be used\
    \ with locally issued certificates as opposed to\n   certificates from an existing\
    \ PKI.\n   Note that public key schemes require a substantial amount of\n   computation.\
    \  Protocol designers should consider whether or not such\n   computations are\
    \ feasible on devices of interest to their clientele.\n   Using certificates roughly\
    \ doubles the number of large\n   exponentiations that must be performed, compared\
    \ with shared secret\n   versions of IKE.\n   Today, even low-powered devices\
    \ can generally perform enough\n   computation to set up a limited number of security\
    \ associations.\n   Concentration points, such as firewalls or VoIP servers, may\
    \ require\n   hardware assists, especially if many peers are expected to create\n\
    \   security associations at about the same time.\n   Using any automated key\
    \ management mechanism can be difficult when\n   trying to protect low-level protocols.\
    \  For example, even though\n   [RFC2461] specified the use of IPsec to protect\
    \ IPv6 Neighbor\n   Discovery, it was impossible to do key management: nodes couldn't\
    \ use\n   IKE because it required IP-level communication, and that isn't\n   possible\
    \ before Neighbor Discovery associations are set up.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Application Programming Interface (API)
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Application Programming Interface (API)\n   It is, in some sense, a misnomer\
    \ to speak of the API as a part of\n   IPsec since this piece is missing on many\
    \ systems.  To the extent\n   that APIs exist, they aren't standardized.  The\
    \ problem is simple:\n   there is no portable way (and often no way at all) for\
    \ an application\n   to request IPsec protection, or to tell if it was used for\
    \ given\n   inbound packets or connections.\n   There are additional problems:\n\
    \   o  Applications rarely have access to such APIs.  Rather, IPsec is\n     \
    \ usually configured by a system or network administrator.\n   o  Applications\
    \ are unable to verify that IPsec services are being\n      used underneath.\n\
    \   o  Applications are unaware of the specific identities and properties\n  \
    \    of the protected channel provided by IPsec.  For instance, the\n      IPsec\
    \ key management mechanisms may be aware of the identity and\n      authorization\
    \ of the peer, but this information cannot be used by\n      the application nor\
    \ linked to application-level decisions, such as\n      access to resources reserved\
    \ to the entity identified by this\n      identity.\n   Router- or firewall-based\
    \ IPsec implementations pose even greater\n   problems since there is no standardized\
    \ over-the-wire protocol for\n   communicating this information from outboard\
    \ encryptors to hosts.\n   By contrast, higher-layer security services, such as\
    \ TLS, are able to\n   provide the necessary control and assurance.\n"
- title: 4.  Availability of IPsec in Target Devices
  contents:
  - "4.  Availability of IPsec in Target Devices\n   Although IPsec is now widely\
    \ implemented and is available for current\n   releases of most host operating\
    \ systems, it is less available for\n   embedded systems.  Few hubs, network address\
    \ translators, etc.,\n   implement it, especially at the low end.  It is generally\n\
    \   inappropriate to rely on IPsec when many of the endpoints are in this\n  \
    \ category.\n   Even for host-to-host use, IPsec availability (and experience\
    \ and\n   ease of use) has generally been for VPNs.  Hosts that support IPsec\n\
    \   for VPN use frequently do not support it on a point-to-point basis,\n   especially\
    \ via a stable, well-defined API or user interface.\n   Finally, few implementations\
    \ support multiple layers of IPsec.  If a\n   telecommuter is using IPsec in VPN\
    \ mode to access an organizational\n   network, he or she may not be able to employ\
    \ a second level of IPsec\n   to protect an application connection to a host within\
    \ the\n   organization.  (We note that such support is, in fact, mandated by\n\
    \   Case 4 of Section 4.5 of [RFC2401].  Nevertheless, it is not widely\n   available.)\
    \  The likelihood of such deployment scenarios should be\n   taken into account\
    \ when deciding whether or not to mandate IPsec.\n"
- title: 5.  Endpoints
  contents:
  - "5.  Endpoints\n   [RFC2401] describes many different forms of endpoint identifier.\n\
    \   These include source addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6), host names\n   (possibly\
    \ as embedded in X.500 certificates), and user IDs (again,\n   possibly as embedded\
    \ in a certificate).  Not all forms of identifier\n   are available on all implementations;\
    \ in particular, user-granularity\n   identification is not common.  This is especially\
    \ a concern for\n   multi-user systems, where it may not be possible to use different\n\
    \   certificates to distinguish between traffic from two different users.\n  \
    \ Again, we note that the ability to provide fine-grained protection,\n   such\
    \ as keying each connection separately and with per-user\n   credentials, was\
    \ one of the original design goals of IPsec.\n   Nevertheless, only a few platforms\
    \ support it.  Indeed, some\n   implementations do not even support using port\
    \ numbers when deciding\n   whether or not to apply IPsec protection.\n"
- title: 6.  Selectors and the SPD
  contents:
  - "6.  Selectors and the SPD\n   Section 4.4 of [RFC2401] describes the Security\
    \ Policy Database (SPD)\n   and \"selectors\" used to decide what traffic should\
    \ be protected by\n   IPsec.  Choices include source and destination addresses\
    \ (or address\n   ranges), protocol numbers (i.e., 6 for TCP and 17 for UDP),\
    \ and port\n   numbers for TCP and UDP.  Protocols whose protection requirements\n\
    \   cannot be described in such terms are poorer candidates for IPsec; in\n  \
    \ particular, it becomes impossible to apply protection at any finer\n   grain\
    \ than \"destination host\".  Thus, traffic embedded in a Layer 2\n   Tunneling\
    \ Protocol (L2TP) [RFC2661] session cannot be protected\n   selectively by IPsec\
    \ above the L2TP layer, because IPsec has no\n   selectors defined that let it\
    \ peer into the L2TP packet to find the\n   TCP port numbers.  Similarly, the\
    \ Stream Control Transmission\n   Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960] did not exist when\
    \ [RFC2401] was written;\n   thus, protecting individual SCTP applications on\
    \ the basis of port\n   number could not be done until a new document was written\
    \ [RFC3554]\n   that defined new selectors for IPsec, and implementations appeared.\n\
    \   Furthermore, in a world that runs to a large extent on dynamically\n   assigned\
    \ addresses and often uses dynamically assigned port numbers\n   as well, an all-or-nothing\
    \ policy for VPNs can work well; other\n   policies, however, can be difficult\
    \ to create in any usable form.\n   The granularity of protection available may\
    \ have side effects.  If\n   certain traffic between a pair of machines is protected\
    \ by IPsec,\n   does the implementation permit other traffic to be unprotected\
    \ or\n   protected by different policies?  Alternatively, if the\n   implementation\
    \ is such that it is only capable of protecting all\n   traffic or none, does\
    \ the device have sufficient CPU capacity to\n   encrypt everything?  Note that\
    \ some low-end devices may have limited\n   secure storage capacity for keys,\
    \ etc.\n   Implementation issues are also a concern here.  As before, too many\n\
    \   vendors have not implemented the full specification; too many IPsec\n   implementations\
    \ are not capable of using port numbers in their\n   selectors.  Protection of\
    \ traffic between two hosts is thus on an\n   all-or-nothing basis when these\
    \ non-compliant implementations are\n   employed.\n"
- title: 7.  Broadcast and Multicast
  contents:
  - "7.  Broadcast and Multicast\n   Although the designers of IPsec tried to leave\
    \ room for protection of\n   multicast traffic, a complete design wasn't finished\
    \ until much\n   later.  As such, many IPsec implementations do not support multicast.\n\
    \   [RFC5374] describes extensions to IPsec to support it.  Other\n   relevant\
    \ documents include [RFC3830], [RFC3547], and [RFC4535].\n   Because of the delay,\
    \ protocol designers who use multicast should\n   consider the availability of\
    \ these extensions in target platforms of\n   interest.\n"
- title: 8.  Specifying IPsec
  contents:
  - "8.  Specifying IPsec\n   Despite all of the caveats given above, it may still\
    \ be appropriate\n   to use IPsec in particular situations.  The range of choices\
    \ makes it\n   mandatory to define precisely how IPsec is to be used.  Authors\
    \ of\n   standards documents that rely on IPsec must specify the following:\n\
    \   a.  What selectors should the initiator of the conversation (the\n       client,\
    \ in client-server architectures) use?  What addresses,\n       port numbers,\
    \ etc., are to be used?\n   b.  What IPsec protocol is to be used: AH or ESP?\
    \  What mode is to be\n       employed: transport mode or tunnel mode?\n   c.\
    \  What form of key management is appropriate?\n   d.  What form of identification\
    \ should be used?  Choices include IP\n       address, DNS name with or without\
    \ a user name, and X.500\n       distinguished name.\n   e.  If the application\
    \ server will switch user IDs (i.e., it is a\n       login service of some sort)\
    \ and user name identification is used,\n       is a new security association\
    \ negotiated that utilizes a user-\n       granularity certificate?  If so, when?\n\
    \   f.  What form of authentication should be used?  Choices include pre-\n  \
    \     shared secrets and certificates.\n   g.  How are the participants authorized\
    \ to perform the operations\n       that they request?  For instance, are all\
    \ devices with a\n       certificate from a particular source allowed to use any\n\
    \       application with IPsec or access any resource?  (This problem can\n  \
    \     appear with any security service, of course.)\n   h.  Which of the many\
    \ variants of IKE must be supported?  Main mode?\n       Aggressive mode?\n  \
    \     Note that there are two different versions of IKE: IKE and IKEv2.\n    \
    \   IKEv2 is simpler and cleaner, but is not yet widely available.\n       You\
    \ must specify which version of IKE you require.\n   i.  Is suitable IPsec support\
    \ available in likely configurations of\n       the products that would have to\
    \ employ IPsec?\n"
- title: 9.  Example
  contents:
  - "9.  Example\n   Let us now work through an example based on these guidelines.\
    \  We\n   will use the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] to show how to\n\
    \   evaluate and specify the use of IPsec for transmission security,\n   rather\
    \ than the mechanism described in [RFC2385].  Note carefully\n   that we are not\
    \ saying that IPsec is an appropriate choice here.\n   Rather, we are demonstrating\
    \ the necessary examination and\n   specification process.  Also note that the\
    \ deeper security issues\n   raised by BGP are not addressed by IPsec or any other\
    \ transmission\n   security mechanism; see [Kent00a] and [Kent00b] for more details.\n\
    \   Selectors        BGP runs between manually configured pairs of hosts\n   \
    \                 on TCP port 179.  The appropriate selector would be\n      \
    \              the pair of BGP speakers, for that port only.  Note\n         \
    \           that the router's \"loopback address\" is almost\n               \
    \     certainly the address to use.\n   Mode             Transport mode would\
    \ be the proper choice if IPsec\n                    were used.  The information\
    \ being communicated is\n                    generally not confidential, so encryption\
    \ need not\n                    be used.  Either AH or ESP can be used; if ESP\
    \ is\n                    used, the sender's IP address would need to be\n   \
    \                 checked against the IP address asserted in the key\n       \
    \             management exchange.  (This check is mandated by\n             \
    \       [RFC2401].)  For the sake of interoperability,\n                    either\
    \ AH or ESP would need to be specified as\n                    mandatory to implement.\n\
    \   Key Management   To permit replay detection, an automated key\n          \

    \ routers used\n                    internally by large ISPs, it is likely that\
    \ shared\n                    key mechanisms are inadequate.  Consequently,\n\
    \                    certificate-based IKE must be supported.  However,\n    \
    \                shared secret mode is reasonable on peering links or\n      \
    \              (perhaps) on links between ISPs and customers.\n              \
    \      Whatever scheme is used, it must tie back to a\n                    source\
    \ IP address or Autonomous System (AS) number\n                    in some fashion,\
    \ since other BGP policies are\n                    expressed in these terms.\
    \  If certificates are used,\n                    would they use IP addresses\
    \ or AS numbers?  Which?\n   Availability     For this scenario, availability\
    \ is the crucial\n                    question.  Do likely BGP speakers -- both\
    \ backbone\n                    routers and access routers -- support the profile\
    \ of\n                    IPsec described above?  Will use of IPsec, with its\n\
    \                    attendant expensive cryptographic operations, raise\n   \
    \                 the issue of new denial-of-service attacks?  The\n         \
    \           working group and the IESG must make these\n                    determinations\
    \ before deciding to use IPsec to\n                    protect BGP.\n"

    \ access control only.\n   There are many other dimensions to protocol security\
    \ that are beyond\n   the scope of this memo, including most notably availability.\
    \  For\n   example, using IPsec does little to defend against denial-of-service\n\
    \   attacks; in some situations, i.e., on CPU-limited systems, it may\n   contribute\
    \ to the attacks.  Within its scope, the security of any\n   resulting protocol\
    \ depends heavily on the accuracy of the analysis\n   that resulted in a decision\
    \ to use IPsec.\n"
