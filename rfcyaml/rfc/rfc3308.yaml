- contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   The L2TP specification currently provides no mechanism for
    supporting\n   diffserv (DS).  This document describes mechanisms that enable
    L2TP\n   to indicate desired PHB code, as defined in [RFC 3140], to be\n   associated
    with an L2TP control connection, as well as individual\n   sessions within an
    L2TP tunnel.\n   The actual bit interpretation of the DS field is beyond the scope
    of\n   this document, and is purposefully omitted.  This document is\n   concerned
    only with defining a uniform exchange and subsequent\n   mapping mechanism for
    the DS AVPs.\n"
  title: 2. Introduction
- contents:
  - "3. Control Connection Operation\n   As defined in [RFC 2661], a control connection
    operates in-band over\n   a tunnel to control the establishment, release, and
    maintenance of\n   sessions and of the tunnel itself.  As such, this document
    provides a\n   mechanism to enable discrimination of L2TP control messages from\n
    \  other packets.  For this purpose, we introduce the Control Connection\n   DS
    (CCDS) AVP.\n   The presence of the CCDS AVP serves as an indication to the peer
    (LAC\n   or LNS) that the tunnel initiator wishes both the tunnel initiator\n
    \  and terminator to use the per-hop behavior(s) (PHB(s)) indicated by\n   the
    AVP's PHB code for all packets within the tunnel's control\n   connection.  A
    PHB is a description of the externally observable\n   forwarding behavior of a
    DS node applied to a particular DS behavior\n   aggregate, as defined in [RFC
    2475].  The most simple example of a\n   PHB is one which guarantees a minimal
    bandwidth allocation of a link\n   to a behavior aggregate.\n   Upon receipt of
    a Start-Control-Connection-Request (SCCRQ) containing\n   the CCDS AVP, if the
    tunnel terminator provides no support for the\n   CCDS AVP it MUST ignore the
    AVP and send an SCCRP to the tunnel\n   initiator without the CCDS AVP.  The tunnel
    initiator interprets the\n   absence of the CCDS AVP in the SCCRP as an indication
    that the tunnel\n   terminator is incapable of supporting CCDS.\n   Upon receipt
    of an SCCRP that contains no CCDS AVP in response to a\n   SCCRQ that contained
    a CCDS AVP, if the tunnel initiator wants to\n   continue tunnel establishment
    it sends an SCCCN.  Otherwise, it sends\n   a StopCCN to the tunnel terminator
    to end the connection.  The\n   StopCCN control message MUST contain the Result
    Code 8 that indicates\n   CCDS AVP value (47) as the reason for sending the StopCCN.\n
    \  If the tunnel terminator provides support for CCDS, it SHOULD use the\n   Host
    Name AVP embedded in SCCRQ to consult its local policy, and to\n   determine whether
    local policy permits the requested PHB code to be\n   used on this control connection.
    \ If it is unwilling or unable to\n   support the requested PHB code after consulting
    the local policy, the\n   tunnel terminator MUST send an SCCRP control message
    containing a\n   CCDS AVP indicating the value it is willing to use.  If the CCDS
    AVP\n   value is the same as the one in the SCCRQ, it signals the acceptance\n
    \  of the requested PHB code.  If the value is different it serves as a\n   counter-offer
    by the tunnel terminator.\n   If the tunnel initiator receives an SCCRP that contains
    a CCDS AVP\n   with a value other than that requested in the SCCRQ, the tunnel\n
    \  initiator SHOULD check the PHB code against its own policy.  If it is\n   unwilling
    to use the value, the tunnel initiator MUST send a StopCCN\n   control message
    containing the Result Code 8 that indicates CCDS AVP\n   value (47) as the reason
    for sending the StopCCN.\n"

  - "4. Session Operation\n   As defined in [RFC 2661], an L2TP session is connection-oriented.
    The\n   LAC and LNS maintain states for each call that is initiated or\n   answered
    by an LAC.  An L2TP session is created between the LAC and\n   LNS when an end-to-end
    connection is established between a Remote\n   System and the LNS.  Datagrams
    related to the connection are sent\n   over the tunnel between the LAC and LNS.
    \ As such, this document\n   provides a mechanism to enable discrimination for
    packets within a\n   particular session from those in other sessions.  For this
    purpose,\n   we introduce the Session DS (SDS) AVP.\n   The presence of the SDS
    AVP serves as an indication to the peer (LAC\n   or LNS) that the session initiator
    wishes both the session initiator\n   and terminator to use the per-hop behavior(s)
    (PHB(s)) indicated by\n   the AVP's PHB code for all packets within the session.\n
    \  Upon receipt of an Incoming-Call-Request (ICRQ) or Outgoing-Call-\n   Request
    (OCRQ) containing the SDS AVP if the session terminator\n   provides no support
    for the requested PHB code, the session\n   terminator MUST ignore the SDS AVP
    and send an ICRP or OCRP to the\n   session initiator without the SDS AVP.  The
    session initiator\n   interprets the absence of the SDS AVP in the ICRP or OCRP
    as an\n   indication that the session terminator is incapable of supporting\n
    \  SDS.\n   Upon receipt of an ICRP or OCRP that contains no SDS AVP in response\n
    \  to an ICRQ or OCRQ that contained an SDS AVP, if the session\n   initiator
    is willing to omit employing SDS AVP it continues session\n   establishment as
    defined in [RFC 2661].  Otherwise, it sends a CDN to\n   the session terminator
    to end the connection.  The CDN control\n   message MUST contain the Result Code
    12 that indicates SDS AVP value\n   (48) as the reason for sending the CDN.\n
    \  In order to help the session terminator to distinguish one session\n   from
    another when consulting the local policy of the PHB code, the\n   session initiator
    MAY use the identifier or a combination of\n   identifiers embedded in AVPs such
    as Proxy Authen Name AVP, Calling\n   Number AVP, Called Number AVP, and Sub-Address
    AVP.  When Proxy\n   Authen Name AVP is used as a distinguishor, it SHOULD be
    present in\n   the ICRQ or OCRQ.  The designated DS identifier(s) used for looking\n
    \  up the PHB code SHOULD be configurable.\n   If the session terminator provides
    support for SDS, it SHOULD use the\n   the designated DS identification AVP (via
    out-of-band agreement\n   between the administrators of the LAC and LNS) to consult
    the local\n   policy and determinate whether the local policy permits the requested\n
    \  PHB code to be used on this session.  If it is unwilling or unable to\n   support
    the requested PHB code the session terminator MUST do one of\n   the following:\n
    \  1) Send a CDN message containing the Result Code 12 that indicates\n      SDS
    AVP value (48) as the reason for sending the CDN.\n   2) Send an Incoming-Call-Reply
    (ICRP) or Outgoing-Call-Reply (OCRP)\n      message containing an SDS AVP indicating
    the PHB code the\n      terminator is willing to use for the session.\n   If the
    session terminator supports the PHB code in the SDS AVP\n   session establishment
    MUST continue as defined in [RFC 2661].\n   If the session initiator receives
    an ICRP or OCRP that contains an\n   SDS AVP with a value other than that requested
    in the ICRQ or OCRQ,\n   and the session initiator is unwilling to use the value,
    the session\n   initiator MUST send a CDN message containing the Result Code 12
    that\n   indicates SDS AVP value (48) as the reason for sending the CDN.  If\n
    \  the session initiator receives an ICRP or OCRP that contains an SDS\n   AVP
    with a value other than that requested in the ICRQ or OCRQ, and\n   the session
    initiator is willing to use the value, the session\n   initiator MUST proceed

    \  successor are the ultimate authority defining PHB encoding.\n   Upon successful
    establishment of an L2TP tunnel control connection or\n   individual L2TP session
    employing the appropriate DS AVP defined in\n   this document, both LAC and LNS
    MUST use their own PHB-to-DSCP\n   mappings of their present DS domains to map

    implementations not cause reordering\n   of packets within an individual connection.
    \ [RFC 3140] requires that\n   a set of PHBs signaled using a single PHB ID MUST
    NOT cause\n   additional packet reordering within an individual connection vs.\n
    \  using a single PHB.  Since the CCDS and SDS AVPs contain one PHB ID,\n   use
    of diffserv PHBs in accordance with this specification should not\n   cause additional
    packet reordering within an L2TP control or data\n   connection.\n   Sequence
    numbers are required to be present in all control messages\n   and are used to
    provide reliable delivery on the control connection,\n   as defined in [RFC 2661].
    \ While packet reordering is inevitably as\n   much a function of the network
    as it is local traffic conditioning,\n   the probability of it occurring when
    employing the CCDS AVP is same\n   as when not employing the AVP.  Data messages
    MAY use sequence\n   numbers to reorder packets and detect lost packets.\n"

    L2TP connection traverses an arbitrary\n   number of DS domains, signaling PHBs
    via L2TP is more appropriate\n   than signaling DSCPs, because it maintains a
    consistent end-to-end\n   differentiated service for the L2TP connection.  As
    per [RFC 2983],\n   the negotiated PHBs are mapped to locally defined DSCPs of
    the\n   current DS domain at the tunnel ingress node.  At the DS domain\n   boundary
    nodes, the DSCPs can be rewritten in the DS field of the\n   outer IP header,
    so that the DSCPs are always with respect to\n   whatever DS domain the packet
    happens to be in.\n   As a result, it is perfectly acceptable that the outermost
    DS field\n   of packets arriving on a given control connection or session are
    not\n   marked with the same DSCP value that was used by the tunnel ingress\n
    \  node.\n"
