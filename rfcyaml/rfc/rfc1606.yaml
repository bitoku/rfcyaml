  - "Abstract\n   This paper reviews the usages of the old IP version protocol. It\n\
    \   considers some of its successes and its failures.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The take-up of the network protocol TCP/IPv9 has been phenomenal\
    \ over\n   the last few years. Gone are the days when there were just a few\n\
    \   million hosts, and the network was understood. As the IP version 9\n   protocol\
    \ comes to the end of its useful life, once again due to\n   address space exhaustion,\
    \ we look back at some of the success of the\n   protocol.\n"
- title: Routing
  contents:
  - "Routing\n   The up to 42 deep hierarchy of routing levels built into IPv9 must\n\
    \   have been one of the key features for its wide deployment. The\n   ability\
    \ to assign a whole network, or group of networks to an\n   electronic component\
    \ must be seen as one of the reasons for its\n   takeup. The use of the Compact\
    \ Disk Hologram units is typical of the\n   usage. They typically have a level\
    \ 37 network number assigned to each\n   logical part, and a level 36 network\
    \ number assigned to the whole\n   device. This allows the CDH management protocol\
    \ to control the unit\n   as a whole, and the high-street vendor to do remote\
    \ diagnostics on\n   discreet elements of the device. This still allows sub-chip\
    \ routing\n   to be done using the 38th level addressing to download new nanocode.\n\
    \   As yet, no requirement has been found for levels 40-42, with level 39\n  \
    \ still being used for experimental interrogation of atomic structure\n   of components\
    \ where required.\n"
- title: Allocation
  contents:
  - "Allocation\n   The vast number space of the IPv9 protocol has also allowed\n\
    \   allocation to be done in a straight forward manner. Typically, most\n   high\
    \ street commercial internet providers issue a range of 1 billion\n   addresses\
    \ to each house. The addresses are then dynamically\n   partitioned into subnet\
    \ hierarchies allowing groups of a million\n   addresses to be allocated for each\
    \ discreet unit (e.g., room/floor\n   etc.) The allocation of sub groups then\
    \ to controllers such as light\n   switches, mains sockets and similar is then\
    \ done from each pool.\n   The allocation process is again done in a hierarchical\
    \ zoned way,\n   with each major application requesting a block of addresses from\
    \ its\n   controller. In this way the light bulb requests an address block from\n\
    \   the light switch, the light switch in turn from the electrical system\n  \
    \ which in turn requests one from the room/floor controller. This has\n   been\
    \ found to be successful due to the enormous range of addresses\n   available,\
    \ and contention for the address space being without\n   problems typically.\n\
    \   Whilst there are still many addresses unallocated the available space\n  \
    \ has been sharply decreased. The discovery of intelligent life on\n   other solar\
    \ systems with the parallel discovery of a faster-than-\n   light transport stack\
    \ is the main cause. This enables real time\n   communication with them, and has\
    \ made the allocation of world-size\n   address spaces necessary, at the level\
    \ 3 routing hierarchy. There is\n   still only 1 global (spatial) level 2 galaxy\
    \ wide network required\n   for this galaxy, although the establishment of permanent\
    \ space\n   stations in deep space may start to exhaust this. This allows level\
    \ 1\n   to be used for inter-galaxy routing. The most pressing problem now is\n\
    \   the case of parallel universes.  Of course there is the danger of\n   assuming\
    \ that there is no higher extrapolation than parallel\n   universes...\n   Up\
    \ to now, the hacking into, and setting of holo-recorder devices to\n   the wrong\
    \ channel from remote galaxies, has not been confirmed, and\n   appears to be\
    \ attributable to finger problem with the remote control\n   whilst travelling\
    \ home from the office.\n"
- title: Applications
  contents:
  - "Applications\n   The introduction of body monitors as IPv9 addresseable units\
    \ injected\n   into the blood stream has been rated as inconclusive. Whilst being\n\
    \   able to have devices lodged in the heart, kidneys, brain, etc.,\n   sending\
    \ out SNMPv9 trap messages at critical events has been a useful\n   monitoring\
    \ tool for doctors, the use of the blood stream as both a\n   delivery and a communication\
    \ highway, has been problematic. The\n   crosstalk between the signals moving\
    \ through the blood stream and the\n   close proximity of nerves has meant that\
    \ patients suffering multiple\n   events at once, can go into violent spasm. This,\
    \ coupled with early\n   problems with broadcasts storms tending to make patients\
    \ blood boil,\n   have led to a rethink on this whole procedure. Also, the requirement\n\
    \   to wear the silly satellite dish hat has led to feelings of\n   embarrassment\
    \ except in California, where it is now the latest trend.\n   The usage of IPv9\
    \ addresseable consumer packaging has been a topic of\n   hot debate. The marketing\
    \ people see it as a godsend, being able to\n   get feedback on how products are\
    \ actually used. Similarly, the\n   recycling is much improved by use of directed\
    \ broadcast, \"All those\n   packages composed of cardboard respond please.\"\
    \ Consumers are not so\n   keen on this seeing it as an invasion of privacy. The\
    \ introduction of\n   the handy-dandy directed stack zapper (which is also rumoured\
    \ to be\n   IPv9 aware) sending directed broadcasts on the local food package\
    \ net\n   effectively resetting the network mask to all 1's has made this an\n\
    \   area of choice.\n   The advent of the IPv9 magazine was universally approved\
    \ of. Being\n   able to ask a magazine where its contents page was the most useful\
    \ of\n   the features. However combined with the networked newspaper/magazine\n\
    \   rack, the ability to find out where you left the magazine with the\n   article\
    \ that was concerned with something about useage of lawn mowers\n   in outer space\
    \ is obvious. The ability to download reading habits\n   automatically into the\
    \ house controller and therefore alert the\n   reader of articles of similar ilk\
    \ is seen as marginal. Alleged\n   querying of this information to discover \"\
    deviant\" behaviour in\n   persons within political office by members of contending\
    \ parties is\n   suspected\n   Sneakernet, as pioneered by shoe specialists skholl\
    \ is seen to be a\n   failure. The market was just not ready for shoes that could\
    \ forward\n   detailed analysis of foot odour to manufacturers...\n"
- title: Manufacture
  contents:
  - "Manufacture\n   Of course, cost is one of the issues that was not considered\
    \ when\n   IPv9 was designed. It took a leap of imagination to believe that one\n\
    \   day anything that wished to be could be IPv9 addresseable. It was\n   assumed\
    \ that IPv9 protocol machines would drop in price as with\n   general chip technology.\
    \ Few people would have forseen the advance in\n   genetic manipulation that allowed\
    \ viruses to be instructed to build\n   nano-technology IPv9 protocol machines\
    \ by the billion for the price\n   or a grain of sugar. Or similarly, the nano-robots\
    \ that could insert\n   and wire these in place.\n   The recent research in quark-quark\
    \ transistors, shows some promise\n   and may allow specially built atoms to be\
    \ used as switches. The\n   manufacture of these will be so expensive (maybe up\
    \ to 10cent an IPv9\n   stack) as to be prohibitive except for the most highly\
    \ demanding\n   niches.\n"
