  - "1.  Introduction\n   Networks are being developed with routers, switches, optical
    cross-\n   connects (OXCs), dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM)\n   optical
    line systems (OLSes), and add-drop multiplexors (ADMs) that\n   use a common control
    plane (e.g., Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)) to\n   dynamically provision resources
    and to provide network survivability\n   using protection and restoration techniques.\n
    \  The Link Management Protocol (LMP) is being developed as part of the\n   GMPLS
    protocol suite to manage traffic engineering (TE) links\n   [RFC4204].  In its
    present form, LMP focuses on peer nodes, i.e.,\n   nodes that peer in signaling
    and/or routing (e.g., OXC-to-OXC, as\n   illustrated in Figure 1).  In this document,
    extensions to LMP are\n   proposed to allow it to be used between a peer node
    and an adjacent\n   optical line system (OLS).  These extensions are intended
    to satisfy\n   the \"Optical Link Interface Requirements\" described in [OLI].
    \ It is\n   assumed that the reader is familiar with LMP, as defined in\n   [RFC4204].\n

    1: LMP Model\n   Consider two peer nodes (e.g., two OXCs) interconnected by a\n
    \  wavelength-multiplexed link, i.e., a DWDM optical link (see Figure 1\n   above).
    \ Information about the configuration of this link and its\n   current state is
    known by the two OLSes (OLS1 and OLS2).  Allowing\n   them to communicate this
    information to the corresponding peer nodes\n   (OXC1 and OXC2) via LMP can improve
    network usability by reducing\n   required manual configuration and by enhancing
    fault detection and\n   recovery.\n   Information about the state of LSPs using
    the DWDM optical link is\n   known by the peer nodes (OXC1 and OXC2), and allowing
    them to\n   communicate this information to the corresponding OLSes (OLS1 and\n
    \  OLS2) is useful for alarm management and link monitoring.  Alarm\n   management
    is important because the administrative state of an LSP,\n   known to the peer
    nodes (e.g., via the Admin Status object of GMPLS\n   signaling [RFC3471]), can
    be used to suppress spurious alarm\n   reporting from the OLSes.\n   The model
    for extending LMP to OLSes is shown in Figure 2.\n         +------+       +------+

    \                     Figure 2: Extended LMP Model\n   In this model, a peer node
    may have LMP sessions with adjacent OLSes,\n   as well as adjacent peer nodes.
    \ In Figure 2, for example, the OXC1-\n   OXC2 LMP session can be used to build
    traffic-engineering (TE) links\n   for GMPLS signaling and routing, as described
    in [RFC4204].  The\n   OXC1-OLS1 and the OXC2-OLS2 LMP sessions are used to exchange\n
    \  information about the configuration of the DWDM optical link and its\n   current
    state and information about the state of LSPs using that\n   link.\n   The latter
    type of LMP sessions is discussed in this document.  It is\n   important to note
    that a peer node may have LMP sessions with one or\n   more OLSes and an OLS may
    have LMP sessions with one or more peer\n   nodes.\n   Although there are many
    similarities between an LMP session between\n   two peer nodes and an LMP session
    between a peer node and an OLS,\n   there are some differences as well.  The former
    type of LMP session\n   is used to provide the basis for GMPLS signaling and routing.
    \ The\n   latter type of LMP session is used to augment knowledge about the\n
    \  links between peer nodes.\n   A peer node maintains its peer node-to-OLS LMP
    sessions and its peer\n   node-to-peer node LMP sessions independently.  This
    means that it\n   MUST be possible for LMP sessions to come up in any order.  In\n
    \  particular, it MUST be possible for a peer node-to-peer node LMP\n   session
    to come up in the absence of any peer node-to-OLS LMP\n   sessions, and vice versa.\n"

    \     3. Link verification\n      4. Fault management\n   All four functions are
    supported in LMP-WDM.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Control Channel Management\n   As in [RFC4204], we do not specify the
      exact implementation of the\n   control channel; it could be, for example, a
      separate wavelength,\n   fiber, Ethernet link, an IP tunnel routed over a separate
      management\n   network, a multi-hop IP network, or the overhead bytes of a data\n
      \  link.\n   The control channel management for a peer node-to-OLS link is the\n
      \  same as for a peer node-to-peer node link, as described in [RFC4204].\n   To
      distinguish between a peer node-to-OLS LMP session and a peer\n   node-to-peer
      node LMP session, a new LMP-WDM CONFIG object is defined\n   (C-Type = 2).  The
      format of the CONFIG object is as follows:\n   Class = 6\n   o     C-Type =
      2, LMP-WDM_CONFIG\n    0                   1                   2                   3\n

      \  The Reserved field should be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.\n   WDM:
      \ 1 bit\n         This bit indicates support for the LMP-WDM extensions defined\n
      \        in this document.\n   OLS:  1 bit\n         If set, this bit indicates
      that the sender is an optical line\n         system (OLS).  If clear, this bit
      indicates that the sender is\n         a peer node.\n   The LMP-WDM extensions
      are designed for peer node-to-OLS LMP\n   sessions.  The OLS bit allows a node
      to identify itself as an OLS or\n   a peer node.  This is used to detect misconfiguration
      of a peer\n   node-to-OLS LMP session between two peer nodes or a peer node-to-peer\n
      \  node LMP session between a peer node and an OLS.\n   If the node does not
      support the LMP-WDM extensions, it MUST reply to\n   the Config message with
      a ConfigNack message.\n   If a peer node that is configured to run LMP-WDM receives
      a Config\n   message with the OLS bit clear in LMP-WDM_CONFIG object, it MUST\n
      \  reply to the Config message with a ConfigNack message.\n"

    - "2.2.  Link Verification\n   The Test procedure used with OLSes is the same
      as described in\n   [RFC4204].  The VerifyTransportMechanism (included in the
      BeginVerify\n   and BeginVerifyAck messages) is used to allow nodes to negotiate
      a\n   link verification method and is essential for line systems that have\n
      \  access to overhead bytes rather than the payload.  The VerifyId\n   (provided
      by the remote node in the BeginVerifyAck message and used\n   in all subsequent
      Test messages) is used to differentiate Test\n   messages from different LMP
      Link Verification procedures.  In\n   addition to the Test procedure described
      in [RFC4204], the trace\n   monitoring function of [RFC4207] may be used for
      link verification\n   when the OLS user ports are SONET or SDH.\n   In a combined
      LMP and LMP-WDM context, there is an interplay between\n   the data links being
      managed by peer node-to-peer node LMP sessions\n   and peer node-to-OLS LMP
      sessions.  For example, in Figure 2, the\n   OXC1-OLS1 LMP session manages the
      data links between OXC1 and OLS1,\n   and the OXC2-OLS2 LMP session manages
      the data links between OXC2 and\n   OLS2.  However, the OXC1-OXC2 LMP session
      manages the data links\n   between OXC1 and OXC2, which are actually a concatenation
      of the data\n   links between OXC1 and OLS1, the DWDM span between OLS1 and
      OLS2, and\n   the data links between OXC2 and OLS2.  It is these concatenated
      links\n   that comprise the TE links that are advertised in the GMPLS TE link\n
      \  state database.\n   The implication of this is that when the data links between
      OXC1 and\n   OXC2 are being verified, using the LMP link verification procedure,\n
      \  OLS1 and OLS2 need to make themselves transparent with respect to\n   these
      concatenated data links.  The coordination of verification of\n   OXC1-OLS1
      and OXC2-OLS2 data links to ensure this transparency is the\n   responsibility
      of the peer nodes, OXC1 and OXC2.\n   It is also necessary for these peer nodes
      to understand the mappings\n   between the data links of the peer node - OLS
      LMP session and the\n   concatenated data links of the peer node - peer node
      LMP session.\n"

    - "2.3.  Link Summarization\n   As in [RFC4204], the LinkSummary message is used
      to synchronize the\n   Interface_Ids and correlate the properties of the TE
      link.  (Note\n   that the term \"TE link\" originated from routing/signaling\n
      \  applications of LMP, and this concept does not necessarily apply to\n   an
      OLS.  However, the term is used in this document to remain\n   consistent with
      LMP terminology.)  The LinkSummary message includes\n   one or more DATA_LINK
      objects.  The contents of the DATA_LINK object\n   consist of a series of variable-length
      data items called Data Link\n   sub-objects describing the capabilities of the
      data links.\n   In this document, several additional Data Link sub-objects are\n
      \  defined to describe additional link characteristics.  The link\n   characteristics
      are, in general, those needed by the CSPF to select\n   the path for a particular
      LSP.  These link characteristics describe\n   the specified peer node-to-OLS
      data link, as well as the associated\n   DWDM span between the two OLSes.\n
      \  The format of the Data Link sub-objects follows the format described\n   in
      [RFC4204] and is shown below for readability:\n    0                   1\n    0

      sub-object in\n         bytes, including the Type and Length fields.  The Length
      MUST\n         be at least 4, and MUST be a multiple of 4.\n   The following
      link characteristics are exchanged on a per data link\n   basis.\n"
    - contents:
      - "2.3.1.  Link Group ID\n   The main purpose of the Link Group ID is to reduce
        control traffic\n   during failures that affect many data links.  A local
        ID may be\n   assigned to a group of data links.  This ID can be used to reduce
        the\n   control traffic in the event of a failure by enabling a single\n   ChannelStatus
        message with the LINK GROUP CHANNEL_STATUS object (see\n   Section 2.4.1)
        to be used for a group of data links instead of\n   individual ChannelStatus
        messages for each data link.  A data link\n   may be a member of multiple
        groups.  This is achieved by including\n   multiple Link Group ID sub-objects
        in the LinkSummary message.\n   The Link Group ID feature allows Link Groups
        to be assigned based on\n   the types of fault correlation and aggregation
        supported by a given\n   OLS.  From a practical perspective, the Link Group
        ID is used to map\n   (or group) data links into \"failable entities\" known
        primarily to the\n   OLS.  If one of those failable entities fails, all associated
        data\n   links are failed and the peer node is notified with a single message.\n
        \  For example, an OLS could create a Link Group for each laser in the\n   OLS.
        \ The data links associated with each laser would then each be\n   assigned
        the Link Group ID for that laser.  If a laser fails, the OLS\n   would then
        report a single failure affecting all of the data links\n   with a Link Group
        ID of the failed laser.  The peer node that\n   receives the single failure
        notification then knows which data links\n   are affected.  Similarly, an
        OLS could create a Link Group ID for a\n   fiber, to report a failure affecting
        all of the data links associated\n   with that fiber if a loss-of-signal (LOS)
        is detected for that fiber.\n   The format of the Link Group ID sub-object
        (Type = 3, Length = 8) is\n   as follows:\n    0                   1                   2

    - "2.4.  Fault Management\n   The Fault Management procedure used between a peer
      and an OLS follows\n   the procedures described in [RFC4204]; some further extensions
      are\n   defined in this section.  The information learned from the OLS-peer\n
      \  fault management procedures may be used to trigger peer-peer LMP\n   fault
      management, or may be used to trigger GMPLS signaling/routing\n   procedures
      directly.\n   Fault management consists of three major functions:\n      1.
      Fault Detection\n      2. Fault Localization\n      3. Fault Notification\n
      \  The fault detection mechanisms are the responsibility of the\n   individual
      nodes and are not specified as part of this protocol.\n   Fault detection mechanisms
      may include a Bit Error Rate (BER)\n   exceeding a threshold, and loss-of-signal
      (LOS) and SONET/SDH-level\n   errors.  It is the responsibility of the OLS to
      translate these\n   failures into (Signal) OK, Signal Failure (SF), or Signal
      Degrade\n   (SD), as described in [RFC4204].\n   That is, an OLS uses the messages
      defined in the LMP fault\n   localization procedures (ChannelStatus, ChannelStatusAck,\n
      \  ChannelStatusRequest, and ChannelStatusResponse messages) to inform\n   the
      adjacent peer node of failures it has detected, in order to\n   initiate the
      LMP fault localization procedures between peer nodes,\n   but it does not participate
      in those procedures.\n   The OLS may also execute its own fault localization
      process to allow\n   it to determine the location of the fault along the DWDM
      span.  For\n   example, the OLS may be able to pinpoint the fault to a particular\n
      \  amplifier in a span of thousands of kilometers in length.\n   To report data
      link failures and recovery conditions, LMP-WDM uses\n   the ChannelStatus, ChannelStatusAck,
      ChannelStatusRequest, and\n   ChannelStatusResponse messages defined in [RFC4204].\n
      \  Each data link is identified by an Interface_ID.  In addition, a Link\n   Group
      ID may be assigned to a group of data links (see Section\n   2.3.1).  The Link
      Group ID may be used to reduce the control traffic\n   by providing channel
      status information for a group of data links.  A\n   new LINK GROUP CHANNEL_STATUS
      object is defined below for this\n   purpose.  This object may be used in place
      of the CHANNEL_STATUS\n   objects described in [RFC4204] in the ChannelStatus
