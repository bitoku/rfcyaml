  - "2. Command meanings\n   In the following, we are discussing a simplex connection,\
    \ as described in \n   the NAOL and NAOP Telnet Options specifications.\n    \
    \  IAC DO NAOVTS \n         The data sender requests or agrees to negotiate about\
    \ output\n         vertical tabstops with the data receiver.  In the case where\n\
    \         agreement has been reached and in the absence of further\n         subnegotiations,\
    \ the data receiver is assumed to be handling output\n         vertical tabstop\
    \ considerations.\n      IAC DON'T NAOVTS \n         The data sender refuses to\
    \ negotiate about output vertical tabstops \n         with the data receiver,\
    \ or demands a return to the unnegotiated \n         default mode.\n      IAC\
    \ WILL NAOVTS \n         The data receiver requests or agrees to negotiate about\
    \ output \n         vertical tabstops with the sender.  In the case where agreement\
    \ has \n         been reached and in the absence of further subnegotiations, the\
    \ data \n         receiver alone is assumed to be handling output vertical tabstop\
    \ \n         considerations.\n      IAC WON'T NAOVTS \n         The data receiver\
    \ refuses to negotiate about output vertical\n         tabstops, or demands a\
    \ return to the unnegotiated default mode.\n      IAC SB NAOVTS DS <8-bit value>\
    \ ... <8-bit value> IAC SE\n         The data sender specifies, with the 8-bit\
    \ value(s), which party\n         should handle output vertical tabstop considerations\
    \ and what the\n         stops should be.  The code for DS is 1.\n      IAC SB\
    \ NAOVTS DR <8-bit value> ... <8-bit value> IAC SE\n         The data receiver\
    \ specifies, with the 8-bit value(s), which party \n         should handle output\
    \ vertical tabstop considerations and what the \n         stops should be.  The\
    \ code for DR is 0.\n"

    \ concerning which party, data\n      sender or data receiver, is handling output\
    \ vertical tabstop\n      considerations, neither party is required to handle\
    \ vertical tabstops\n      and neither party is prohibited from handling them;\
    \ but it is\n      appropriate if at least the data receiver handles vertical\
    \ tabstop\n      considerations, albeit primitively.\n   the DS and DR SB commands\
    \ as follows (multiple 8-bit values are allowed\n   only if each is greater than\
    \ zero and less than 251):\n      8-bit value                      Meaning   \

    \         \n      1 to 250     Command sender suggests that the other party alone\
    \ \n                   should handle the stops, but suggests that the     \n \
    \                  indicated value(s) be used.  Each value is the line \n    \
    \               number, relative to the top of the printer page or \n        \

    \ the data receiver must do it, and\n      2) if both data receiver and data sender\
