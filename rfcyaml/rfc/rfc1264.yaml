    \ and\n   documenting Internet standards on routing protocols.  These\n   procedures\
    \ have been established by the Internet Activities Board\n   (IAB) in consultation\
    \ with the Internet Engineering Steering Group\n   (IESG).  Distribution of this\

- title: 1.0  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.0  Introduction\n   The IAB and the IESG have evolved a three-stage Internet\n\
    \   standardization process.  This process is explained in the \"IAB\n   Official\
    \ Protocol Standards\", published as an RFC several times a\n   year (the current\
    \ version is RFC 1250).\n   In brief, the three stages of Internet standardization\
    \ are Proposed\n   (which requires a well written, openly reviewed specification),\
    \ Draft\n   (which requires Proposed status, multiple implementations and some\n\
    \   operational experience), and full Internet Standard (which requires\n   Draft\
    \ status and more extensive operational experience).  The IAB and\n   IESG are\
    \ currently developing a more detailed explanation of the\n   process, which will\
    \ be available as an RFC.\n   The purpose of this document is to provide more\
    \ specific guidance for\n   the advancement of routing protocols.  All levels\
    \ of the\n   standardization process are covered.\n   There are currently two\
    \ types of routing protocol in the Internet.\n   These are Interior Gateway Protocols\
    \ (IGP) sometimes called Intra-\n   Domain Routing Protocols and Exterior Gateway\
    \ Protocols (EGP)\n   sometimes called Inter-Domain Routing Protocols.  This document\
    \ uses\n   the terms IGP and EGP.\n"
- title: 2.0 Motivation

  - "2.0 Motivation\n   The motivation for these requirements two-fold.  The first\
    \ is to\n   reduce the risk that there will be serious technical problems with\
    \ a\n   routing protocol after it reaches Draft Standard.  The second is to\n\
    \   insure that the new routing protocol will support the continued\n   growth\
    \ of the Internet.\n   Routing protocols are complex, widely distributed, real-time\n\
    \   algorithms.  They are difficult to implement and to test.  Even\n   though\
    \ a protocol may work in one environment with one\n   implementation, that does\
    \ not ensure that it will work in a different\n   environment with multiple vendors.\
    \  A routing protocol may work well\n   within a range of topologies and number\
    \ of networks and routers, but\n   may fail when an unforeseen limit is reached.\
    \  The result is that\n   even with considerable operational experience, it is\
    \ hard to\n   guarantee that the protocol is mature enough for widespread\n  \
    \ deployment.\n   The Internet is currently growing at an exponential rate.  Routing\n\
    \   protocols and the management of internet addressing are key elements\n   in\
    \ the successful operation the Internet.  It is important that new\n   routing\
    \ protocols be designed to support this rapid growth.\n"
- title: 3.0 General Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.0 General Requirements\n   1) Documents specifying the Protocol and its Usage.\
    \  This may be\n      one or more documents.  The specifications for the routing\n\
    \      protocol must be well written such that independent,\n      interoperable\
    \ implementations can be developed solely based on\n      the specification. \
    \ For example, it should be possible to\n      develop an interoperable implementation\
    \ without consulting the\n      original developers of the routing protocol.\n\
    \   2) A Management Information Base (MIB) must be written for the\n      protocol.\
    \  Routing protocols, like all other internet protocols,\n      need a MIB defined\
    \ so they can be remotely managed.\n   3) A security architecture of the protocol\
    \ must be defined.  The\n      security architecture must include mechanisms for\
    \ authenticating\n      routing messages and may include other forms of protection.\n\
    \   4) Generally, a number of interoperable implementations must\n      exist.\
    \  At least two must be written independently.\n   5) There must be evidence that\
    \ all features of the protocol have\n      been tested, running between at least\
    \ two implementations.  This\n      must include that all of the security features\
    \ have been\n      demonstrated to operate, and that the mechanisms defined in\
    \ the\n      protocol actually provide the intended protection.\n   6) There must\
    \ be operational experience with the routing\n      protocol.  The level of operational\
    \ experience required is\n      dependent on which level of standardization is\
    \ requested.  All\n      significant features of the protocol must be exercised.\
    \  In the\n      case of an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), both interior and\n\
    \      exterior routes must be carried (unless another mechanism is\n      provided\
    \ for the exterior routes).  In the case of a Exterior\n      Gateway Protocol\
    \ (EGP), it must carry the full complement of\n      exterior routes.\n   7) Two\
    \ reports must be submitted to the IESG via the Routing Area\n      Director.\
    \  The first report must document how requirements 1)\n      through 6) of this\
    \ document have been satisfied.  It must\n      include:\n      - Implementation\
    \ experience.\n      - Reference to the MIB for the protocol.\n      - Description\
    \ of the authentication mechanisms in the protocol.\n      - List of implementations\
    \ including origin of code.\n      - Test scenarios and test results showing that\
    \ all features of the\n        protocols have been tested.\n      - Description\
    \ of operational experience.  This must include\n        topology, environment,\
    \ time and duration, implementations\n        involved, and overall results and\
    \ conclusions gained from the\n        operational experience.\n   The second\
    \ report must summarize the key features of the protocol and\n   analyze how the\
    \ protocol will perform and scale in the Internet.  The\n   intent of this requirement\
    \ is to understand the boundary conditions\n   of the routing protocol.  The new\
    \ routing protocol must be compared\n   with the existing routing protocols (e.g.,\
    \ RIP, EGP, etc.) as\n   appropriate.  The report should answer several questions:\n\
    \      - What are the key features and algorithms of the protocol?\n      - How\
    \ much link bandwidth, router memory and router CPU cycles\n        does the protocol\
    \ consume under normal conditions?\n      - For these metrics, how does the usage\
    \ scale as the routing\n        environment grows?  This should include topologies\
    \ at least an\n        order of magnitude larger than the current environment.\n\
    \      - What are the limits of the protocol for these metrics? (I.e.,\n     \
    \   when will the routing protocol break?)\n      - For what environments is the\
    \ protocol well suited, and for what\n        is it not suitable?\n   The IESG\
    \ will forward to the IAB its recommendation for advancement\n   of the new routing\
    \ protocol based on its evaluation of protocol\n   specifications and these reports.\n"
