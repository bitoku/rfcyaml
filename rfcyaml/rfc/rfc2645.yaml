  - "1.  Abstract\n   With the spread of low-cost computer systems and Internet\n
    \  connectivity, the demand for local mail servers has been rising.\n   Many people
    now want to operate a mail server on a system which has\n   only an intermittent
    connection to a service provider.  If the system\n   has a static IP address,
    the ESMTP ETRN command [ETRN] can be used.\n   However, systems with dynamic IP
    addresses (which are very common\n   with low-cost connections) have no widely-deployed
    solution.\n   This memo proposes a new service, On-Demand Mail Relay (ODMR), which\n
    \  is a profile of SMTP [SMTP, ESMTP], providing for a secure,\n   extensible,
    easy to implement approach to the problem.\n"
  title: 1.  Abstract
- contents:
  - "2.  Conventions Used in this Document\n   Because the client and server roles
    reverse during the session, to\n   avoid confusion, the terms \"customer\" and
    \"provider\" will be used in\n   place of \"client\" and \"server\", although
    of course this protocol may\n   be useful in cases other than commercial service
    providers and\n   customers.\n   In examples, \"P:\" is used to indicate lines
    sent by the provider, and\n   \"C:\" indicates those sent by the customer.  Line
    breaks within a\n   command are for editorial purposes only.\n   The key words
    \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   in this document
    are to be interpreted as defined in [KEYWORDS].\n   Examples use 'example.net'
    as the provider, and 'example.org' and '\n   example.com' as the customers.\n"

  - "4.  Description\n   On-Demand Mail Relay is a restricted profile of SMTP [SMTP,
    ESMTP].\n   Port 366 is reserved for On-Demand Mail Relay.  The initial client\n
    \  and server roles are short-lived, as the point is to allow the\n   intermittently-connected
    host to request mail held for it by a\n   service provider.\n   The customer initiates
    a connection to the provider, authenticates,\n   and requests its mail.  The roles
    of client and server then reverse,\n   and normal SMTP [SMTP, ESMTP] proceeds.\n
    \  The provider has an On-Demand Mail Relay process listening for\n   connections
    on the ODMR port.  This process does not need to be a\n   full SMTP server.  It
    does need to be an SMTP client with access to\n   the outgoing mail queues, and
    as a server implement the EHLO, AUTH,\n   ATRN, and QUIT commands.\n   An MTA
    normally has a mail client component which processes the\n   outgoing mail queues,
    attempting to send mail for particular domains,\n   based on time or event (such
    as new mail being placed in the queue,\n   or receipt of an ETRN command by the
    SMTP server component).  The\n   On-Demand Mail Relay service processes the outgoing
    queue not on a\n   timer or new mail creation, but on request.\n   The provider
    side has normal SMTP server responsibilities [SMTP],\n   including generation
    of delivery failure notices, etc. as needed.\n"

  - "5.  States\n   The On-Demand Mail Relay service has three states: an initial
    state,\n   an authenticated state, and a reversed state.  The state progression\n
    \  is illustrated in the following diagram:\n   ---------------------------\n
    \  !      initial state      !\n   ---------------------------\n     !             !\n
    \  QUIT           AUTH\n     !             !\n     !             V\n     !      -----------------------\n

    \    !       !            V\n     !       !      ------------------\n     !       !

    - "5.1.  Initial State\n   In the initial state, the provider is the server and
      the customer is\n   the client.  Three commands are valid:  EHLO, AUTH, and
      QUIT.\n"
    - contents:
      - "5.1.1.  EHLO\n   The EHLO command is the same as in [ESMTP].  The response
        MUST\n   include AUTH and ATRN.\n"
      title: 5.1.1.  EHLO
    - contents:
      - "5.1.2.  AUTH\n   The AUTH command is specified in [AUTH].  The AUTH command
        uses a\n   [SASL] mechanism to authenticate the session.  The session is not\n
        \  considered authenticated until a success response to AUTH has been\n   sent.\n
        \  For interoperability, implementations MUST support the CRAM-MD5\n   mechanism
        [CRAM].  Other SASL mechanisms may be supported.  A site\n   MAY disable CRAM-MD5
        support if it uses more secure methods.  The\n   EXTERNAL mechanism [SASL]
        might be useful in some cases, for example,\n   if the provider has already
        authenticated the client, such as during\n   a PPP connection.\n"

      title: 5.1.3.  QUIT
    title: 5.1.  Initial State
  - contents:
    - "5.2.  Authenticated State\n   The authenticated state is entered after a successful
      AUTH command.\n   Two commands are valid in the authenticated state:  ATRN and
      QUIT.\n"
    - contents:
      - "5.2.1.  ATRN (Authenticated TURN)\n   Unlike the TURN command in [SMTP],
        the ATRN command optionally takes\n   one or more domains as a parameter.
        \ The ATRN command MUST be\n   rejected if the session has not been authenticated.
        \ Response code\n   530 [AUTH] is used for this.\n   The timeout for this
        command MUST be at least 10 minutes to allow the\n   provider time to process
        its mail queue.\n   An ATRN command sent with no domains is equivalent to
        an ATRN command\n   specifying all domains to which the customer has access.\n
        \  If the authentication used by the customer does not provide access to\n
        \  all of the domains specified in ATRN, the provider MUST NOT send mail\n
        \  for any domains to the customer; the provider MUST reject the ATRN\n   command
        with a 450 code.\n   If the customer does have access to all of the specified
        domains, but\n   none of them have any queued mail, the provider normally
        rejects the\n   ATRN command with response code 453.  The provider MAY instead
        issue\n   a 250 success code, and after the roles are reversed, send a QUIT\n
        \  following the EHLO.\n   The provider MAY also reject the ATRN command with
        a 450 response to\n   indicate refusal to accept multiple requests issued
        within a\n   particular time interval.\n   If the customer has access to all
        of the specified domains and mail\n   exists in at least one of them, the
        provider issues a 250 success\n   code.\n   If the server is unable to verify
        access to the requested domains\n   (for example, a mapping database is temporarily
        unavailable),\n   response code 451 is sent.\n      [ABNF] for ATRN:\n      atrn
        \         = \"ATRN\" [SP domain *(\",\" domain)]\n      domain        = sub-domain
        1*(\".\" sub-domain)\n      sub-domain    = (ALPHA / DIGIT) *(ldh-str)\n      ldh-str
        \      = *(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\") (ALPHA / DIGIT)\n"

      ATRN command, the\n   roles reverse, and the customer becomes the server, and
      the provider\n   becomes the client.\n   After receiving the success response
      to ATRN, the customer sends a\n   standard SMTP initial greeting line.  At this
      point normal SMTP\n   [SMTP, ESMTP] commands are used.  Typically the provider
      sends EHLO\n   after seeing the customer's greeting, to be followed by MAIL
      FROM and\n   so on.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Because access to the On-Demand Mail Relay server
    is only useful with\n   a prior arrangement between the parties (so the provider
    is the\n   target of MX records for the customer's domains and thus has mail to\n
    \  relay), it may be useful for the provider to restrict access to the\n   On-Demand
    Mail Relay port.  For example, the ODMR server could be\n   configurable, or a
    TCP wrapper or firewall could be used, to block\n   access to port 366 except
    within the provider's network.  This might\n   be useful when the provider is
    the customer's ISP.  Use of such\n   mechanisms does not reduce the need for the
    AUTH command, however,\n   but can increase the security it provides.\n   Use
    of SASL in the AUTH command allows for substitution of more\n   secure authentication
    mechanisms in the future.\n   See sections 5.1.2 and 5.2.1 for additional security
    details.\n"
