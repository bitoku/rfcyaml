  - "1.  Introduction\n   Network systems for monitoring the physical world contain\
    \ many\n   battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices.  For example, in an\n\
    \   environmental monitoring system or a temperature and humidity\n   monitoring\
    \ system, there may not be always on and sustained power\n   supplies for the\
    \ potentially large number of constrained devices.  In\n   such deployment scenarios,\
    \ it is necessary to optimize the energy\n   consumption of the constrained devices.\
    \  In this document, we\n   describe techniques that are in common use at Layer\
    \ 2 and at Layer 3,\n   and we indicate the need for higher-layer awareness of\
    \ lower-layer\n   features.\n   Many research efforts have studied this \"energy\
    \ efficiency\" problem.\n   Most of this research has focused on how to optimize\
    \ the system's\n   power consumption in certain deployment scenarios or how an\
    \ existing\n   network function such as routing or security could be more energy\n\
    \   efficient.  Only few efforts have focused on energy-efficient designs\n  \
    \ for IETF protocols and standardized network stacks for such\n   constrained\
    \ devices [CLASS1-CoAP].\n   The IETF has developed a suite of Internet protocols\
    \ suitable for\n   such constrained devices, including IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless\n\
    \   Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) [RFC6282] [RFC6775] [RFC4944], the\n   IPv6\
    \ Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)\n   [RFC6550], and the\
    \ Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252].\n   This document tries to\
    \ summarize the design considerations for making\n   the IETF constrained protocol\
    \ suite as energy efficient as possible.\n   While this document does not provide\
    \ detailed and systematic\n   solutions to the energy-efficiency problem, it summarizes\
    \ the design\n   efforts and analyzes the design space of this problem.  In\n\
    \   particular, it provides an overview of the techniques used by the\n   lower\
    \ layers to save energy and how these may impact on the upper\n   layers.  Cross-layer\
    \ interaction is therefore considered in this\n   document from this specific\
    \ point of view.  Providing further design\n   recommendations that go beyond\
    \ the layered protocol architecture is\n   out of the scope of this document.\n\
    \   After reviewing the energy-efficient designs of each layer, we\n   summarize\
    \ the document by presenting some overall conclusions.\n   Though the lower-layer\
    \ communication optimization is the key part of\n   energy-efficient design, the\
    \ protocol design at the upper layers is\n   also important to make the device\
    \ energy efficient.\n"

- title: 3.  Medium Access Control and Radio Duty Cycling
  contents:
  - "3.  Medium Access Control and Radio Duty Cycling\n   In networks, communication\
    \ and power consumption are interdependent.\n   The communication device is typically\
    \ the most power-consuming\n   component, but merely refraining from transmissions\
    \ is not enough to\n   achieve a low power consumption: the radio may consume\
    \ as much power\n   in listen mode as when actively transmitting.  This illustrates\
    \ the\n   key problem known as idle listening, whereby the radio of a device\n\
    \   may be in receive mode (ready to receive any message), even if no\n   message\
    \ is being transmitted to that device.  Idle listening can\n   consume a huge\
    \ amount of energy unnecessarily.  To reduce power\n   consumption, the radio\
    \ must be switched completely off -- duty-cycled\n   -- as much as possible. \
    \ By applying duty cycling, the lifetime of a\n   device operating on a common\
    \ button battery may be on the order of\n   years, whereas otherwise the battery\
    \ may be exhausted in a few days\n   or even hours.  Duty cycling is a technique\
    \ generally employed by\n   devices that use the P1 strategy [RFC7228], which\
    \ need to be able to\n   communicate on a relatively frequent basis.  Note that\
    \ a more\n   aggressive approach to save energy relies on the P0 (Normally-off)\n\
    \   strategy, whereby devices sleep for very long periods and communicate\n  \
    \ infrequently, even though they spend energy in network reattachment\n   procedures.\n\
    \   From the perspective of Medium Access Control (MAC) and Radio Duty\n   Cycling\
    \ (RDC), all upper-layer protocols, such as routing, RESTful\n   communication,\
    \ adaptation, and management flows, are applications.\n   Since the duty-cycling\
    \ algorithm is the key to energy efficiency of\n   the wireless medium, it synchronizes\
    \ transmission and/or reception\n   requests from the higher layers.\n   MAC and\
    \ RDC are not in the scope of the IETF, yet lower-layer\n   designers and chipset\
    \ manufacturers take great care to save energy.\n   By knowing the behaviors of\
    \ these lower layers, engineers can design\n   protocols that work well with them.\
    \  The IETF protocols to be\n   discussed in the following sections are the customers\
    \ of the lower\n   layers.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Techniques for Radio Duty Cycling
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Techniques for Radio Duty Cycling\n   This subsection describes three main\
    \ RDC techniques.  Note that more\n   than one of these techniques may be available\
    \ or can even be combined\n   in a specific radio technology:\n   a)  Channel\
    \ sampling: In this solution, the radio interface of a\n       device periodically\
    \ monitors the channel for very short time\n       intervals (i.e., with a low\
    \ duty cycle) with the aim of detecting\n       incoming transmissions.  In order\
    \ to make sure that a receiver\n       can correctly receive a transmitted data\
    \ unit, the sender may\n       prepend a preamble of a duration at least the sampling\
    \ period to\n       the data unit to be sent.  Another option for the sender is\
    \ to\n       repeatedly transmit the data unit instead of sending a preamble\n\
    \       before the data unit.  Once a transmission is detected by a\n       receiver,\
    \ the receiver may stay awake until the complete\n       reception of the data\
    \ unit.  Examples of radio technologies that\n       use preamble sampling include\
    \ ContikiMAC, the Coordinated Sampled\n       Listening (CSL) mode of IEEE 802.15.4e\
    \ [IEEE802.15.4], and the\n       Frequently Listening (FL) mode of ITU-T G.9959\
    \ [G9959].\n   b)  Scheduled transmissions: This approach allows a device to know\n\
    \       the particular time at which it should be awake (during some time\n  \
    \     interval) in order to receive data.  Otherwise, the device may\n       remain\
    \ in sleep mode.  The decision on the times at which\n       communication is\
    \ attempted relies on some form of negotiation\n       between the involved devices.\
    \  Such negotiation may be performed\n       per transmission or per session/connection.\
    \  Bluetooth Low Energy\n       (Bluetooth LE) is an example of a radio technology\
    \ based on this\n       mechanism.\n   c)  Listen after send: This technique allows\
    \ a node to remain in\n       sleep mode by default, then wake up and poll a sender\
    \ (which must\n       be ready to receive a poll message) for pending transmissions.\n\
    \       After sending the poll message, the node remains in receive mode\n   \
    \    and is ready for a potential incoming transmission.  After a\n       certain\
    \ time interval, the node may go back to sleep.  For\n       example, this technique\
    \ is used in the Receiver Initiated\n       Transmission (RIT) mode of IEEE 802.15.4e\
    \ [IEEE802.15.4] and in\n       the transmission of data between a coordinator\
    \ and a device in\n       the 2003 version of IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Latency and Buffering
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Latency and Buffering\n   The latency of a data unit transmission to a\
    \ duty-cycled device is\n   equal to or greater than the latency of transmitting\
    \ to an always-on\n   device.  Therefore, duty cycling leads to a trade-off between\
    \ energy\n   consumption and latency.  Note that in addition to a latency\n  \
    \ increase, RDC may introduce latency variance since the latency\n   increase\
    \ is a random variable (which is uniformly distributed if duty\n   cycling follows\
    \ a periodic behavior).\n   On the other hand, due to the latency increase introduced\
    \ by duty\n   cycling, a sender waiting for a transmission opportunity may need\
    \ to\n   store subsequent outgoing packets in a buffer.  This buffering would\n\
    \   increase memory requirements and potentially incur queuing wait\n   times.\
    \  Such wait times would in turn contribute to packet\n   transmission delay and\
    \ increase the probability of buffer overflow,\n   leading to losses.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Throughput
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Throughput\n   Although throughput is not typically a key concern in constrained-\n\
    \   node network applications, it is indeed important in some services in\n  \
    \ such networks, such as over-the-air software updates or when off-line\n   sensors\
    \ accumulate measurements that have to be quickly transferred\n   when there is\
    \ an opportunity for connectivity.\n   Since RDC introduces inactive intervals\
    \ in energy-constrained\n   devices, it reduces the throughput that can be achieved\
    \ when\n   communicating with such devices.  There exists a trade-off between\n\
    \   the achievable throughput and energy consumption.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Radio Interface Tuning
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Radio Interface Tuning\n   The parameters controlling the radio duty cycle\
    \ have to be carefully\n   tuned to achieve the intended application and/or network\n\
    \   requirements.  On the other hand, upper layers should take into\n   account\
    \ the expected latency and/or throughput behavior due to RDC.\n   The next subsection\
    \ provides details on key parameters controlling\n   RDC mechanisms, and thus\
    \ fundamental trade-offs, for various examples\n   of relevant low-power radio\
    \ technologies.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Packet Bundling
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Packet Bundling\n   Another technique that may be useful to increase communication\
    \ energy\n   efficiency is packet bundling.  This technique, which is available\
    \ in\n   several radio interfaces (e.g., LTE and some 802.11 variants), allows\n\

    \ of time.\n   Basic Service Set (BSS) Max Idle Period Management:  Enables an\
    \ AP to\n      indicate a time period during which the AP does not disassociate\
    \ a\n      STA due to non-receipt of frames from the STA.  This supports\n   \
    \   improved STA power saving and AP resource management.\n   FMS:  A service\
    \ in which a non-AP STA can request a multicast\n      delivery interval longer\

  contents:
  - "3.6.2.  Power Save Services Provided by Bluetooth LE\n   Bluetooth LE is a wireless\
    \ low-power communications technology that\n   is the hallmark component of the\
    \ Bluetooth 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2\n   specifications [Bluetooth42].  BTLE has been\
    \ designed for the goal of\n   ultra-low power consumption.  IPv6 can be run IPv6\
    \ over Bluetooth LE\n   networks by using a 6LoWPAN variant adapted to BTLE [RFC7668].\n\
    \   Bluetooth LE networks comprise a master and one or more slaves, which\n  \
    \ are connected to the master.  The Bluetooth LE master is assumed to\n   be a\
    \ relatively powerful device, whereas a slave is typically a\n   constrained device\
    \ (e.g., a Class 1 device).\n   Medium access in Bluetooth LE is based on a Time-Division\
    \ Multiple\n   Access (TDMA) scheme that is coordinated by the master.  This device\n\
    \   determines the start of connection events in which communication\n   between\
    \ the master and a slave takes place.  At the beginning of a\n   connection event,\
    \ the master sends a poll message, which may\n   encapsulate data, to the slave.\
    \  The latter must send a response,\n   which may also contain data.  The master\
    \ and the slave may continue\n   exchanging data until the end of the connection\
    \ event.  The next\n   opportunity for communication between the master and the\
    \ slave will\n   be in the next connection event scheduled for the slave.\n  \
    \ The time between consecutive connection events is defined by the\n   connInterval\
    \ parameter, which may range between 7.5 ms and 4 s.  The\n   slave may remain\
    \ in sleep mode from the end of its last connection\n   event until the beginning\
    \ of its next connection event.  Therefore,\n   Bluetooth LE is duty-cycled by\
    \ design.  Furthermore, after having\n   replied to the master, a slave is not\
    \ required to listen to the\n   master (and thus may keep the radio in sleep mode)\
    \ for\n   connSlaveLatency consecutive connection events. connSlaveLatency is\n\
    \   an integer parameter between 0 and 499 that should not cause link\n   inactivity\
    \ for more than connSupervisionTimeout time.  The\n   connSupervisionTimeout parameter\
    \ is in the range between 100 ms and\n   32 s.\n   Upper-layer protocols should\
    \ take into account the medium access and\n   duty-cycling behavior of Bluetooth\
    \ LE.  In particular, connInterval,\n   connSlaveLatency, and connSupervisionTimeout\
    \ determine the time\n   between two consecutive connection events for a given\
    \ slave.  The\n   upper-layer packet generation pattern and rate should be consistent\n\
    \   with the settings of the aforementioned parameters (and vice versa).\n   For\
    \ example, assume connInterval = 4 seconds, connSlaveLatency =\n   7 seconds,\
    \ and connSupervisionTimeout = 32 seconds.  With these\n   settings, communication\
    \ opportunities between a master and a slave\n   will occur during a given interval\
    \ every 32 seconds.  Duration of the\n   interval will depend on several factors,\
    \ including number of\n   connected slaves, amount of data to be transmitted,\
    \ etc.  In the\n   worst case, only one data unit can be sent from master to slave\
    \ (and\n   vice versa) every 32 seconds.\n"

    \ is a family of standard radio interfaces\n   for low-rate, low-power wireless\
    \ networking.  Since the publication\n   of its first version in 2003, IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ [IEEE802.15.4] has become\n   the de facto choice for a wide range of constrained-node\
    \ network\n   application domains and has been a primary target technology of\n\
    \   various IETF working groups such as 6LoWPAN [RFC6282] [RFC6775]\n   [RFC4944]\
    \ and 6TiSCH [ARCH-6TiSCH].  IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4]\n   specifies a variety\
    \ of related Physical layer (PHY) and MAC layer\n   functionalities.\n   IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4] defines three roles called device,\n   coordinator,\
    \ and Personal Area Network (PAN) coordinator.  The device\n   role is adequate\
    \ for nodes that do not implement the complete IEEE\n   802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4]\
    \ functionality and is mainly targeted for\n   constrained nodes with a limited\
    \ energy source.  The coordinator role\n   includes synchronization capabilities\
    \ and is suitable for nodes that\n   do not suffer severe constraints (e.g., a\
    \ mains-powered node).  The\n   PAN coordinator is a special type of coordinator\
    \ that acts as a\n   principal controller in an IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4] network.\n\
    \   IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4] defines two main types of networks\n   depending\
    \ on their configuration: beacon-enabled and non-beacon-\n   enabled networks.\
    \  In the first network type, coordinators\n   periodically transmit beacons.\
    \  The time between beacons is divided\n   in three main parts: the Contention\
    \ Access Period (CAP), the\n   Contention Free Period (CFP), and an inactive period.\
    \  In the first\n   period, nodes use slotted Carrier Sense Multiple Access with\n\
    \   Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) for data communication.  In the second\n   one,\
    \ a TDMA scheme controls medium access.  During the idle period,\n   communication\
    \ does not take place, and thus the inactive period is a\n   good opportunity\
    \ for nodes to turn the radio off and save energy.\n   The coordinator announces\
    \ in each beacon the list of nodes for which\n   data will be sent in the subsequent\
    \ period.  Therefore, devices may\n   remain in sleep mode by default and wake\
    \ up periodically to listen to\n   the beacons sent by their coordinator.  If\
    \ a device wants to transmit\n   data, or learns from a beacon that it is an intended\
    \ destination,\n   then it will exchange messages with the coordinator (and thus\
    \ consume\n   energy).  An underlying assumption is that when a message is sent\
    \ to\n   a coordinator, the radio of the coordinator will be ready to receive\n\
    \   the message.\n   The beacon interval and the duration of the active portion\
    \ of the\n   beacon interval (i.e., the CAP and the CFP), and thus the duty cycle,\n\
    \   can be configured.  The parameters that control these times are\n   called\
    \ macBeaconOrder and macSuperframeOrder, respectively.  As an\n   example, when\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4] operates in the 2.4 GHz\n   PHY, both times can\
    \ be (independently) set to values in the range\n   between 15.36 ms and 251.6\
    \ s.\n   In the beaconless mode, nodes use unslotted CSMA/CA for data\n   transmission.\
    \  The device may be in sleep mode by default and may\n   activate its radio to\
    \ either i) request to the coordinator whether\n   there is pending data for the\
    \ device, or to ii) transmit data to the\n   coordinator.  The wake-up pattern\
    \ of the device, if any, is out of\n   the scope of IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4].\n\
    \   Communication between the two ends of an IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4]\n  \
    \ link may also take place in a peer-to-peer configuration, whereby\n   both link\
    \ ends assume the same role.  In this case, data transmission\n   can happen at\
    \ any moment.  Nodes must have their radio in receive\n   mode and be ready to\
    \ listen to the medium by default (which for\n   battery-enabled nodes may lead\
    \ to a quick battery depletion) or apply\n   synchronization techniques.  The\
    \ latter are out of the scope of IEEE\n   802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4].\n   The main\
    \ MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4] amendment to date is\n   IEEE 802.15.4e.\
    \  This amendment includes various new MAC layer modes,\n   some of which include\
    \ mechanisms for low energy consumption.  Among\n   these, the Time-Slotted Channel\
    \ Hopping (TSCH) is an outstanding mode\n   that offers robust features for industrial\
    \ environments, among\n   others.  In order to provide the functionality needed\
    \ to enable IPv6\n   over TSCH, the 6TiSCH Working Group was created.  TSCH is\
    \ based on a\n   TDMA schedule whereby a set of timeslots are used for frame\n\
    \   transmission and reception, and other timeslots are unscheduled.  The\n  \
    \ latter timeslots may be used by a dynamic scheduling mechanism,\n   otherwise,\
    \ nodes may keep the radio off during the unscheduled\n   timeslots, thus saving\
    \ energy.  The minimal schedule configuration\n   specified in [RFC8180] comprises\
    \ 101 timeslots; 95 of these timeslots\n   are unscheduled and the timeslot duration\
    \ is 15 ms.\n   The previously mentioned CSL and RIT are also 802.15.4e modes\n\
    \   designed for low energy.\n"

    \ is a wireless technology building on\n   the key fundamentals of traditional\
    \ DECT / Cordless Advanced\n   Technology - internet and quality (CAT-iq) [EN300]\
    \ but with specific\n   changes to significantly reduce the power consumption\
    \ at the expense\n   of data throughput [TS102].  DECT ULE devices typically operate\
    \ on\n   special power-optimized silicon but can connect to a DECT Gateway\n \
    \  supporting traditional DECT/CAT-iq for cordless telephony and data as\n   well\
    \ as the DECT ULE extensions.  IPv6 can be run over DECT ULE by\n   using a 6LoWPAN\
    \ variant [RFC8105].\n   DECT defines two major roles: the Portable Part (PP)\
    \ is the power\n   constrained device while the Fixed Part (FP) is the Gateway\
    \ or base\n   station in a star topology.  Because TDMA/FDMA and Time-Division\n\
    \   Duplex (TDD) using dynamic channel allocation for interference, DECT\n   operates\
    \ in license-free and reserved frequency bands.  It provides\n   good indoor (~50\
    \ m) and outdoor (~300 m) coverage.  It uses a frame\n   length of 10 ms divided\
    \ into 24 timeslots, and it supports\n   connection-oriented packet data and connection-less\
    \ services.\n   The FP usually transmits a so-called dummy bearer (beacon) that\
    \ is\n   used to broadcast synchronization, system, and paging information.\n\
    \   The slot/carrier position of this dummy bearer can automatically be\n   reallocated\
    \ in order to avoid mutual interference with other DECT\n   signals.\n   At the\
    \ MAC level, DECT ULE communications between FP and PP are\n   initiated by the\
    \ PP.  An FP can initiate communication indirectly by\n   sending a paging signal\
    \ to a PP.  The PP determines the timeslot and\n   frequency in which the communication\
    \ between FP and PP takes place.\n   The PP verifies the radio timeslot/frequency\
    \ position is unoccupied\n   before it initiates its transmitter.  An access-request\
    \ message,\n   which usually carries data, is sent to the FP.  The FP sends a\n\
    \   confirm message, which also may carry data.  More data can be sent in\n  \
    \ subsequent frames.  A MAC-level automatic retransmission scheme\n   significantly\
    \ improves the reliability of data transfer.  A\n   segmentation and reassembly\
    \ scheme supports transfer of larger,\n   higher-layer Service Data Units (SDUs)\
    \ and provides data integrity\n   checks.  The DECT ULE packet data service ensures\
    \ data integrity,\n   proper sequencing, and duplicate protection but not guaranteed\n\
    \   delivery.  Higher-layer protocols have to take this into\n   consideration.\n\
    \   The FP may send paging information to PPs to trigger connection setup\n  \
    \ and indicate the required service type.  The interval between paging\n   information\
    \ to a specific PP can be defined in the range of 10 ms to\n   327 s.  The PP\
    \ may enter sleep mode to save power.  The listening\n   interval is defined by\
    \ the PP application.  For short sleep intervals\n   (below ~10 seconds), the\
    \ PP may be able to retain synchronization to\n   the FP dummy bearer and only\
    \ turn on the receiver during the expected\n   timeslot.  For longer sleep intervals,\
    \ the PP can't keep\n   synchronization and has to search for, and resynchronize\
    \ to, the FP\n   dummy bearer.  Hence, longer sleep intervals reduce the average\n\
    \   energy consumption but add an energy consumption penalty for\n   acquiring\
    \ synchronization to the FP dummy bearer.  The PP can obtain\n   all information\
    \ to determine paging and acquire synchronization\n   information in a single\
    \ reception of one full timeslot.\n   Packet data latency is normally 30 ms for\
    \ short packets (below or\n   equal to 32 octets), however, if retry and back-off\
    \ scenarios occur,\n   the latency is increased.  The latency can actually be\
    \ reduced to\n   about 10 ms by doing energy consuming Received Signal Strength\n\
    \   Indication (RSSI) scanning in advance.  In the direction from FP to\n   PP,\
    \ the latency is usually increased by the used paging interval and\n   the sleep\
    \ interval.  The MAC layer can piggyback commands to improve\n   efficiency (reduce\
    \ latency) of higher-layer protocols.  Such commands\n   can instruct the PP to\
    \ initiate a new packet transfer in N frames\n   without the need for resynchronization\
    \ and can listen to paging or\n   instruct the PP to stay in a higher duty-cycle\
    \ paging detection mode.\n   The DECT ULE technology allows a per-PP configuration\
    \ of paging\n   interval, MTU size, reassembly window size, and higher-layer service\n\
    \   negotiation and protocol.\n"
- title: 4.  IP Adaptation and Transport Layer
  contents:
  - "4.  IP Adaptation and Transport Layer\n   6LoWPAN provides an adaptation layer\
    \ designed to support IPv6 over\n   IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4]. 6LoWPAN affects\
    \ the energy-efficiency\n   problem in three aspects, as follows.\n   First, 6LoWPAN\
    \ provides one fragmentation and reassembly mechanism,\n   which is aimed at solving\
    \ the packet size issue in IPv6 and could\n   also affect energy efficiency. \
    \ IPv6 requires that every link in the\n   Internet have an MTU of 1280 octets\
    \ or greater.  On any link that\n   cannot convey a 1280-octet packet in one piece,\
    \ link-specific\n   fragmentation and reassembly must be provided at a layer below\
    \ IPv6\n   [RFC8200].  6LoWPAN provides fragmentation and reassembly below the\n\
    \   IP layer to solve the problem.  One of the benefits from placing\n   fragmentation\
    \ at a lower layer such as the 6LoWPAN layer is that it\n   can avoid the presence\
    \ of more IP headers because fragmentation at\n   the IP layer will produce more\
    \ IP packets, each one carrying its own\n   IP header.  However, performance can\
    \ be severely affected if, after\n   IP layer fragmentation, then 6LoWPAN fragmentation\
    \ happens as well\n   (e.g., when the upper layer is not aware of the existence\
    \ of the\n   fragmentation at the 6LoWPAN layer).  One solution is to require\
    \ that\n   the higher layers have an awareness of the lower-layer features and\n\
    \   generate small enough packets to avoid fragmentation.  In this\n   regard,\
    \ the Block option in CoAP can be useful when CoAP is used at\n   the application\
    \ layer [RFC7959].\n   Secondly, 6LoWPAN swaps computing with communication. 6LoWPAN\
    \ applies\n   compression of the IPv6 header.  Subject to the packet size limit\
    \ of\n   IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4], a 40-octet-long IPv6 header and an 8 or\n\
    \   20-octet-long UDP and TCP header will consume even more packet space\n   than\
    \ the data itself. 6LoWPAN provides IPv6 and UDP header\n   compression at the\
    \ adaptation layer.  Therefore, a lower amount of\n   data will be handled by\
    \ the lower layers, whereas both the sender and\n   receiver will spend more computing\
    \ power on the compression and\n   decompression of the packets over the air.\
    \  Compression can also be\n   performed at higher layers (see Section 6.4).\n\
    \   Finally, the 6LoWPAN Working Group developed the energy-efficient\n   Neighbor\
    \ Discovery called 6LoWPAN-ND, which is an energy-efficient\n   replacement of\
    \ the IPv6 ND in constrained environments.  IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery was not\
    \ designed for non-transitive wireless\n   links, as its heavy use of multicast\
    \ makes it inefficient and\n   sometimes impractical in a low-power and lossy\
    \ network. 6LoWPAN-ND\n   describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery,\
    \ its\n   addressing mechanisms, and duplicate address detection for Low-Power\n\
    \   Wireless Personal Area Networks and similar networks.  However,\n   6LoWPAN-ND\
    \ does not modify Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD)\n   timeouts, which\
    \ are very short (by default three transmissions spaced\n   1 second apart). \
    \ NUD timeout settings should be tuned to take into\n   account the latency that\
    \ may be introduced by duty-cycled mechanisms\n   at the link layer or the alternative,\
    \ less impatient NUD algorithms\n   should be considered [RFC7048].\n   IPv6 underlies\
    \ the higher-layer protocols, including both TCP/UDP\n   transport and applications.\
    \  By design, the higher-layer protocols do\n   not typically have specific information\
    \ about the lower layers and\n   thus cannot solve the energy-efficiency problem.\n\
    \   The network stack can be designed to save computing power.  For\n   example,\
    \ the Contiki implementation has multiple cross-layer\n   optimizations for buffers\
    \ and energy management, e.g., the computing\n   and validation of UDP/TCP checksums\
    \ without the need of reading IP\n   headers from a different layer.  These optimizations\
    \ are software\n   implementation techniques and are out of the scope of the IETF\
    \ and\n   the LWIG Working Group.\n"

    \ and\n   keeps routing states for each destination.  RPL is optimized for the\n\
    \   many-to-one communication pattern (where network nodes primarily send\n  \
    \ data towards the border router) but has provisions for any-to-any\n   routing\
    \ as well.\n   The authors of the Powertrace tool [Powertrace] studied the power\n\
    \   profile of RPL.  Their analysis divides the routing protocol into\n   control\
    \ and data traffic.  The control plane carries ICMP messages to\n   establish\
    \ and maintain the routing states.  The data plane carries\n   any application\
    \ that uses RPL for routing packets.  The study has\n   shown that the power consumption\
    \ of the control traffic goes down\n   over time in a relatively stable network.\
    \  The study also reflects\n   that the routing protocol should keep the control\

    \ control\n   traffic can be tuned by setting the Trickle [RFC6206] algorithm\n\
    \   parameters (i.e., Imin, Imax, and k) to appropriate values.  However,\n  \

    \ CoAP provides an observe mode in which the requester\n   registers its interest\
    \ of a certain resource and the responder will\n   report the value whenever it\
    \ was updated.  This reduces the request/\n   response round trips while keeping\
    \ information exchange an ubiquitous\n   service; an energy-constrained server\
    \ can remain in sleep mode during\n   the period between observe notification\
    \ transmissions.\n   Furthermore, [RFC7252] defines CoAP proxies that can cache\
    \ resource\n   representations previously provided by sleepy CoAP servers.  The\n\
    \   proxies themselves may respond to client requests if the\n   corresponding\
    \ server is sleeping and the resource representation is\n   recent enough.  Otherwise,\
    \ a proxy may attempt to obtain the resource\n   from the sleepy server.\n   CoAP\
    \ proxy and cache functionality may also be used to perform data\n   aggregation.\
    \  This technique allows a node to receive data messages\n   (e.g., carrying sensor\
    \ readings) from other nodes in the network,\n   perform an operation based on\
    \ the content in those messages, and\n   transmit the result of the operation.\
    \  Such operation may simply be\n   intended to use one packet to carry the readings\
    \ transported in\n   several packets (which reduces header and transmission overhead),\
    \ or\n   it may be a more sophisticated operation, possibly based on\n   mathematical,\
    \ logical, or filtering principles (which reduces the\n   payload size to be transmitted).\n"
- title: 6.2.  Sleepy Node Support
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Sleepy Node Support\n   Beyond these features of CoAP, there have been\
    \ a number of proposals\n   to further support sleepy nodes at the application\
    \ layer by\n   leveraging CoAP mechanisms.  A good summary of such proposals can\
    \ be\n   found in [SLEEPY-DEVICES], while an example application (in the\n   context\
    \ of illustrating several security mechanisms) in a scenario\n   with sleepy devices\
    \ has been described [CRYPTO-SENSORS].  Approaches\n   to support sleepy nodes\
    \ include exploiting the use of proxies,\n   leveraging the resource directory\
    \ [CoRE-RD], or signaling when a node\n   is awake to the interested nodes.  Recent\
    \ work defines publish-\n   subscribe and message queuing extensions to CoAP and\
    \ the resource\n   directory in order to support devices that spend most of their\
    \ time\n   asleep [CoAP-BROKER].  Notably, this work has been adopted by the\n\
    \   CoRE Working Group.\n   In addition to the work within the scope of CoAP to\
    \ support sleepy\n   nodes, other specifications define application-layer functionality\n\
    \   for the same purpose.  The Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M)\n   specification\
    \ from the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) defines a queue\n   mode whereby an LwM2M\
    \ Server queues requests to an LwM2M Client until\n   the latter (which may often\
    \ stay in sleep mode) is online.  LwM2M\n   functionality operates on top of CoAP.\n\
    \   oneM2M defines a CoAP binding with an application-layer mechanism for\n  \
    \ sleepy nodes [oneM2M].\n"
- title: 6.3.  CoAP Timers
  contents:
  - "6.3.  CoAP Timers\n   CoAP offers mechanisms for reliable communication between\
    \ two CoAP\n   endpoints.  A CoAP message may be signaled as a confirmable (CON)\n\
    \   message, and an acknowledgment (ACK) is issued by the receiver if the\n  \
    \ CON message is correctly received.  The sender starts a\n   Retransmission Timeout\
    \ (RTO) for every CON message sent.  The initial\n   RTO value is chosen randomly\
    \ between 2 and 3 s.  If an RTO expires,\n   the new RTO value is doubled (unless\
    \ a limit on the number of\n   retransmissions has been reached).  Since duty\
    \ cycling at the link\n   layer may lead to long latency (i.e., even greater than\
    \ the initial\n   RTO value), CoAP RTO parameters should be tuned accordingly\
    \ in order\n   to avoid spurious RTOs that would unnecessarily waste node energy\
    \ and\n   other resources.  On the other hand, note that CoAP can also run on\n\
    \   top of TCP [RFC8323].  In that case, similar guidance applies to TCP\n   timers,\
    \ albeit with greater motivation to carefully configure TCP RTO\n   parameters\
    \ since [RFC6298] reduced the default initial TCP RTO to 1\n   second, which may\
    \ interact more negatively with duty-cycled links\n   than default CoAP RTO values.\n"
- title: 6.4.  Data Compression
  contents:
  - "6.4.  Data Compression\n   Another method intended to reduce the size of the\
    \ data units to be\n   communicated in constrained-node networks is data compression,\
    \ which\n   allows to encode data using fewer bits than the original data\n  \
    \ representation.  Data compression is more efficient at higher layers,\n   particularly\
    \ before encryption is used.  In fact, encryption\n   mechanisms may generate\
    \ an output that does not contain redundancy,\n   making it almost impossible\
    \ to reduce the data representation size.\n   In CoAP, messages may be encrypted\
    \ by using Datagram Transport Layer\n   Security (DTLS) or TLS when CoAP over\
    \ TCP is used, which is the\n   default mechanism for securing CoAP exchanges.\n"
- title: 7.  Summary and Conclusions
  contents:
  - "7.  Summary and Conclusions\n   We summarize the key takeaways of this document:\n\
    \   a.  Internet protocols designed by the IETF can be considered the\n      \
    \ customer of the lower layers (PHY, MAC, and duty cycling).  To\n       reduce\
    \ power consumption, it is recommended that Layer 3 designs\n       should operate\
    \ based on awareness of lower-level parameters\n       rather than treating the\
    \ lower layer as a black box (see Sections\n       4, 5, and 6).\n   b.  It is\
    \ always useful to compress the protocol headers in order to\n       reduce the\
    \ transmission/reception power.  This design principle\n       has been employed\
    \ by many protocols in the 6lo and CoRE Working\n       Groups (see Sections 4\
    \ and 6).\n   c.  Broadcast and non-synchronized transmissions consume more than\n\
    \       other TX/RX operations.  If protocols must use these ways to\n       collect\
    \ information, reduction of their usage by aggregating\n       similar messages\
    \ together will be helpful in saving power (see\n       Sections 2 and 6.1).\n\
    \   d.  Saving power by sleeping as much as possible is used widely\n       (Section\
    \ 3).\n"
