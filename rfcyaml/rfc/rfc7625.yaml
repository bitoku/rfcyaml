  - "Abstract\n   This document describes an IP/MPLS network that has an infrastructure\n\
    \   that can be separated into two or more strata.  For the\n   implementation\
    \ described in this document, the infrastructure has\n   been separated into two\
    \ strata: one for the \"Hard Pipes\", called the\n   \"Hard Pipe Stratum\", and\
    \ one for the normal IP/MPLS traffic, called\n   the \"Normal IP/MPLS Stratum\"\
    .\n   This document introduces the concept of a Hard Pipe -- an MPLS Label\n \
    \  Switched Path (LSP) or a pseudowire (PW) with a bandwidth that is\n   guaranteed\
    \ and can neither be exceeded nor infringed upon.\n   The Hard Pipe stratum does\
    \ not use statistical multiplexing; for the\n   LSPs and PWs set up within this\
    \ stratum, the bandwidth is guaranteed\n   end to end.\n   The document does not\
    \ specify any new protocol or procedures.  It\n   does explain how the MPLS standards\
    \ implementation has been deployed\n   and operated to meet the requirements from\
    \ operators that offer\n   traditional Virtual Leased Line (VLL) services.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   IP leased line services, Ethernet Private Line (EPL), and\
    \ Time-\n   Division Multiplexed (TDM) leased line services are commonly offered\n\
    \   by operators worldwide.\n   There are customers, e.g., many enterprises, that\
    \ insist on TDM\n   leased line services.  They do so regardless of the fact that\
    \ the\n   same operators often offer IP leased line services and EPL services\n\
    \   at a lower price and with a guaranteed bandwidth.\n   Today we see a trend\
    \ that TDM (in particular, Synchronous Digital\n   Hierarchy / Synchronous Optical\
    \ Network (SDH/SONET)) networks are\n   gradually carrying less and less traffic,\
    \ and many operators want to\n   shut their TDM networks down to reduce costs.\n\
    \   In light of these trends, vendors and operators have built and\n   deployed\
    \ the Hard Pipe service described in this document.  It is a\n   way to introduce\
    \ leased line service with the same characteristics as\n   TDM leased line services\
    \ in IP/MPLS networks.\n   Even if leased line has been the initial motivation\
    \ to define the\n   Hard Pipe technology, the Hard Pipe is by no means limited\
    \ to support\n   leased line services.  When guaranteed bandwidth is the priority,\n\
    \   Virtual Private Wire Services (VPWS), Virtual Private LAN Services\n   (VPLS),\
    \ L3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPN), and IP-only Private LAN\n   Services can\
    \ be mapped to a tunnel in the Hard Pipe stratum.\n   EPL and Ethernet Private\
    \ LAN (EPLAN) are out of scope for this\n   document.\n   Virtual Leased Line\
    \ service is used in examples throughout this\n   document.\n   The solution soon\
    \ to be deployed has an Ethernet infrastructure that\n   has been split into two\
    \ parallel logical networks -- two parallel\n   strata.  The first stratum --\
    \ the Hard Pipe Stratum -- does not use\n   statistical multiplexing, and bandwidth\
    \ is guaranteed end to end.\n   The second stratum -- the Normal IP/MPLS Stratum\
    \ -- works as a normal\n   IP/MPLS network.  The two strata share the same physical\
    \ network,\n   i.e., routers and links, but the resource reserved for the Hard\
    \ Pipe\n   stratum will never be preempted by the Normal IP/MPLS stratum.\n  \
    \ The routers will handle the traffic belonging to one stratum\n   differently\
    \ from how traffic from the other stratum is handled.  This\n   separation in\
    \ traffic handling is based on support in hardware.\n   The reader of this document\
    \ is assumed to be familiar with RFC 3031\n   [RFC3031] and RFC 5921 [RFC5921].\n"

    \ view, functionally identical to TDM-like\n      leased lines; and\n   o  to\

- title: 2.  The Stratified Network
  contents:
  - "2.  The Stratified Network\n   The concept of stratified or strata networks has\
    \ been around for some\n   time.  It appears to have different meaning in different\
    \ contexts.\n   The way we use the concept is that we logically assign certain\n\
    \   characteristics to part of the network.  The part of the network that\n  \
    \ has the special characteristics form one stratum, and the \"remainder\"\n  \
    \ forms a second stratum.  The network described in this document uses\n   a single\
    \ link-layer technology, Ethernet.\n   In many cases, a whole physical interface\
    \ is assigned to a single\n   hard stratum, especially in the scenario where there\
    \ are many\n   physical links between two nodes.\n   This document does not address\
    \ the network configuration\n   possibilities for Hard Pipe and IP/MPLS strata\
    \ in detail.  There are\n   configuration options, the basic configuration is\
    \ that one Hard Pipe\n   stratum and one IP/MPLS stratum are provisioned.\n  \
    \ However, it is also possible to provision more than one Hard Pipe\n   stratum,\
    \ e.g., if customers want enhanced separation for their leased\n   line.  Even\
    \ though the main driver for the Hard Pipe technology is\n   the leased lines,\
    \ any service for which an operator does not want to\n   use statistical multiplexing\
    \ will benefit from using the Hard Pipes.\n"

  - "3.  Configuring the Leased Lines in the Hard Pipe Stratum\n   When the strata\
    \ are provisioned, the IP/MPLS stratum is set up\n   exactly as any other IP/MPLS\
    \ network.  The one small difference\n   between provisioning the Hard Pipe stratum\
    \ and the IP/MPLS stratum is\n   that no overbooking is done for the Hard Pipe\
    \ stratum.\n   Overbooking and/or congestion in the IP/MPLS stratum can not affect\n\
    \   the Hard Pipe stratum.\n   All labels used for the Hard Pipe stratum are \"\
    Configured Labels\",\n   i.e., labels that are provisioned and reclaimed by management\n\
    \   actions.  These management actions can be by manual actions or by an\n   NMS/Controller\
    \ or a centralized controller.  For the size of network\n   being deployed, manual\
    \ configuration is not practical; we are both\n   provisioning and reclaiming\
    \ a label from an NMS/Controller.\n   o  If an operator wants to set up a leased\
    \ line, it is first checked\n      if there is a path available in the Hard Pipe\
    \ stratum that matches\n      the criteria (e.g., bandwidth) for the requested\
    \ leased line.\n      *  If such a path does exist, it is checked if there is\
    \ a matching\n         MPLS tunnel available over that path.\n         +  If such\
    \ a tunnel exists, it is used to establish the leased\n            line by adding\
    \ L-labels forming an LSP that are carried by\n            the tunnel.  L-labels\
    \ are known only by the ingress and\n            egress LSRs.  They are local\
    \ to the endpoints the same way\n            that the label signaled by Targeted\
    \ LDP (tLDP) is local to\n            the endpoints of a targeted session LSP.\
    \  (Here, \"Targeted\n            LDP\" means LDP as defined in RFC 5036 [RFC5036],\
    \ using\n            Targeted Hello messages.)\n            At the same time,\
    \ the available bandwidth in the Hard Pipe\n            stratum is decremented\
    \ by the bandwidth that is needed for\n            the leased line for every hop\
    \ across this stratum in the\n            global resource table (for the Hard\
    \ Pipe stratum).\n         +  If such a tunnel does not exist, it can be established\
    \ so\n            that the leased line can be set up as above.\n      *  If the\
    \ path does not exist (not enough bandwidth in the Hard\n         Pipe stratum\
    \ for the leased line), available bandwidth on the\n         links is checked\
    \ to see if the stratum can be expanded to\n         accommodate such a path.\n\
    \         +  If the Hard Pipe stratum can be expanded, this is done and\n    \
    \        the tunnel for the leased line is established as described\n        \
    \    above.\n            It is likely that other modifications of the Hard Pipe\n\
    \            stratum, e.g., consolidating already set up Hard IP tunnels\n   \
    \         on to existing links so that room for new leased lines are\n       \
    \     created, may have implications that go well outside the\n            leased\
    \ line service, and it is currently not viewed as a\n            fully automated\
    \ operation.\n         +  If it is not possible to expand the Hard Pipe stratum\
    \ to\n            accommodate the new path, set up of the leased line will\n \
    \           need to be declined.\n   Thus, given the existence of a viable Hard\
    \ Pipe stratum, leased lines\n   are configured in two very simple steps.  First,\
    \ establish a hop-by-\n   hop tunnel (T-labels), and second, configure the leased\
    \ lines\n   (L-labels).  The T-labels need to be configured on both the PE and\
    \ P\n   routers while L-labels only need to be configured on the PE routers.\n\
    \   Note that L-labels may be used for normal IP service [RFC3031],\n   BGP/MPLS\
    \ VPNs [RFC4364], or PWs [RFC3985].\n"

  - "4.3.  Annotations for Configuring Leased Lines\n   The annotations given below\
    \ are neither a programming guideline nor\n   an indication how this architecture\
    \ could be implemented.  It is\n   rather an indication of how much data needs\
    \ to be saved for each\n   stratum and leased line, as well as where this data\
    \ could be stored.\n   Considering the Hard Pipe stratum as it has been outlined\
    \ in\n   Figure 2, there is actually some additional information related to\n\
    \   the Hard Pipe stratum that not is shown in the figure.\n   Looking explicitly\
    \ on the link between LSR J and K we find:\n           +---+           +---+ \

    \            Figure 4\n   The annotation [4,0]G means that 4G is allocated to\
    \ the stratum on\n   the link between J and K, and of these, 0G has been allocated\
    \ to a\n   service.\n   If we were to allocate two tunnels labels from the labels\
    \ that have\n   been configured to work within the Hard Pipe stratum, the resource\n\
    \   view would look like this:\n           +---+           +---+           +---+\

    \ Figure 5\n   Note that allocating the tunnel labels does not reserve bandwidth\
    \ for\n   the tunnel from the Hard Pipe stratum.\n   When the L-labels are assigned,\
    \ this will consume bandwidth; so we\n   need to keep track of the bandwidth per\
    \ leased line and the total of\n   bandwidth allocated from the Hard Pipe stratum.\n\

    \   The Hard Pipe stratum link between nodes J and K has 4G bandwidth\n      allocated;\
    \ of the total bandwidth, 1.5G is allocated for leased\n      lines.\n      Tunnel\
    \ label T1 carries two leased lines, each of 0.5G, and tunnel\n      label T2\
    \ carries a third leased line of 0.5G.\n   Note that it is not necessary to keep\
    \ this information in the nodes;\n   it is held within the NMS/Controller.  Also,\
    \ it is not necessary to\n   keep the bandwidth per leased line, but some operations\
    \ are\n   simplified (e.g., removing a leased line) if this is done.\n"
- title: 5.  Setting Up Leased Lines
  contents:
  - "5.  Setting Up Leased Lines\n   Consider the case where an operator wants to\
    \ set up a leased line of\n   0.4G from F to G in the Hard Pipe stratum in Figure\
    \ 2.\n   Since there are no constraints other than bandwidth and ingress and\n\
    \   egress PEs, the shortest path will be chosen.  A tunnel will be\n   configured\
    \ from F to G over the nodes F, H, J, K, L, and G, and a\n   Leased Line label\
    \ (a) will be configured on F and G, and the\n   available resources will be recalculated.\n\
    \   A second leased line of 0.3G between the same PEs is easily\n   configured\
    \ by adding a new Leased Line label (b) at the ingress and\n   egress PEs.\n \
    \  After these operations, a view of the Hard Pipe stratum resources\n   (available\
    \ bandwidth) would look like this:\n           +---+    2G     +---+         \

    \ Operations\n   If the operator now wishes to establish a new leased line with\
    \ the\n   criteria being that it should originate from F and terminate at G,\n\
    \   have 0.4G bandwidth, and pass through node E, then analysis of the\n   Hard\
    \ Pipe stratum (after establishing the first two listed lines) and\n   the criteria\
    \ for the new leased line would give the following:\n   o  The existing tunnel\
    \ cannot be used since it does not pass through\n      E; a new tunnel need to\
    \ be established.\n   o  The hop from F to H cannot be used since the available\
    \ bandwidth\n      is insufficient.\n   o  Since no existing tunnels meet the\
    \ criteria requested, a new\n      tunnel will be set up from F, to B, C, J, K,\
    \ L, E (the criteria to\n      pass through E), and to G.\n   A new L-label (c)\
    \ to be carried over T2 will be configured on F and\n   G, and the available resources\
    \ of the Hard Pipe stratum will be\n   recalculated.\n"
