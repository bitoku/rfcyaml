  - "             MARS - A Message Archiving & Retrieval Service\nI.    Introduction\n\
    \      ------------\nThis document describes a Message Archiving  and  Retrieval\
    \  Service\n(MARS) which has been developed at Computer Corporation of America;\
    \ it\nutilizes the Datacomputer, a network database utility developed by CCA\n\
    for  ARPA.   [Research  and development of a prototype MARS system was\nsupported\
    \ by the Defense Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  of  the\nDepartment  of\
    \  Defense,  under the ARPA Very Large Databases program,\nand was monitored by\
    \ the Office of Naval Research under  Contract  No.\nN00014-76-C-0991.]\nThe \
    \ Service  is  available,  primarily,  to  groups  for  storage  of\nteleconferencing\
    \ transcripts.  Is is also available, upon request,  to\nindividual ARPANET correspondents.\n\
    There  are  both  'public'  and  'private'  messages  in the database.\nPublic\
    \ messages may be retrieved by  anyone.   The  public  collection\nincludes  the\
    \  messages of the Header-People [@ MIT-MC] group, and the\nMsgGroup [@ USC-ISI]\
    \ proceedings.\nPrivate messages may be retrieved only by the users who have \
    \ archived\nthem,  or anyone whose name appears on the list of message recipients.\n\
    Messages archived using MARS are heavily indexed and can be  retrieved\nin  a\
    \  variety  of  ways,  including  Boolean  combinations of message\nrecipients,\
    \ message composition date, any text words  in  the  message\nsubject,  and text\
    \ words in the message body.  The MARS facilities are\nintegrated  very   naturally\
    \   into   the   existing   collection   of\nmessage-handling tools:\n   . A message\
    \ is designated for archiving by sending it to\n     MARS-Filer @ CCA using one\
    \ of the usual message-mailing tools such\n     as SNDMSG.\n   . A message is\
    \ designated for retrieval by sending a request as\n     ordinary mail to MARS-Retriever\
    \ @ CCA.\nThe  Filer  program  checks for mail every hour; the Retriever program\n\
    checks every quarter-hour.  The periodicity can  be  altered  to  meet\ndemand\
    \  but  the intent is for MARS to operate as a background job and\nonly during\
    \ extremely low-activity periods.\nThe next section (II) describes  the  indexing\
    \  operation  in  greater\ndetail,  and  how  to archive and retrieve messages.\
    \  The last section\n(III) is an extractable user card.\nNWG/RFC  744        \

    \ & Retrieval Service\nII.       Using MARS\n          ----------\nA.  Message\
    \ Indexing\n    ----------------\nFor each message, a vector of parsed tokens\
    \ is  created.   The  parsed\ntokens are collected by the message-field in which\
    \ they occurred -- to\nbe  used  as  \"indexes\",  i.e.,  values  of  inverted\
    \  fields,  by the\nDatacomputer.\nThe Filer \"indexes\", essentially  without\
    \  analysis,  except  for  the\nfollowing:\n   --  Each distinguishable section\
    \ of the message is indexed\n       separately; each header line is a separate\
    \ inversion domain, as\n       is the body of the message.\n   --  The header\
    \ lines which contain ARPANET addresses are analyzed in\n       order to index\
    \ separately on mailbox and host.\n   --  The date-field is parsed and converted\
    \ to the standard Tenex\n       internal date/time format, which is better adapted\
    \ for\n       less-than/greater-than comparisons, as in retrievals which\n   \
    \    specify a date range.\n   --  One-character words in both the subject-field\
    \ and the\n       message-text field arbitrarily discarded.\n   --  Two-character\
    \ words in the message-text field are arbitrarily\n       discarded.\n   --  Hyphenated\
    \ phrases, i.e., words bound together by hyphens, are\n       retained intact.\n\
    \   --  All message formats which conform to RFC  733 standards are\n       accommodated.\
    \  The minimum requirements are:  a date-field, a\n       from-field, and a blank\
    \ line between the message-header and\n       message-body.\nNWG/RFC  744    \
    \                               JS5 8-Jan-78 21:59  42857\nMARS - A Message Archiving\
    \ & Retrieval Service\nB.  To Archive Messages\n    -------------------\nThere\
    \  are  three modes of filing currently supported by MARS, to wit:\n   --  single-message\
    \ mode, wherein the MARS-Filer mailbox appears in\n       the message as an addressee;\n\
    \   --  forwarded-message mode, wherein the MARS-Filer mailbox appears as\n  \
    \     the only primary recipient;\n   and\n   --  batch mode, wherein the mailing\
    \ envelope is addressed to\n       MARS-Filer and the subject-field contains the\
    \ keyword \"batch\".\nUntil the ARPANET standard for the format of messages  is\
    \  implemented\nuniversally, the variability amongst formats is still greater\
    \ than the\nFiler can handle as it stands.  Nonetheless, a user  can  successfully\n\
    file  any  message in a \"foreign\" format by forwarding it to the Filer\nunder\
    \ the aegis of a mail-handling program  which  does  produce  good\nformats. \
    \  Admittedly, the correct header-field indexing, as described\nabove, will not\
    \ be done on the enclosed message;  but  at  least,  the\nwords  in  its unreadable\
    \ header fields will appear as \"text\" words in\nthe indexing.\nIn the case of\
    \ forwarded-message-mode filing, all interesting indexing\ninformation is extracted\
    \ from the  message-header  of  the  forwarding\nenvelope  prior  to discarding\
    \ it.  The name of the archiver, the date\nand time the message was forwarded,\
    \ and the  subject-line  information\nare   recorded.   The  remainder  is  handled\
    \  as  though  it  were  a\nnon-forwarded message which had been CC'd to the Filer.\n\
    A forwarded message may be 'annotated' by adding  text  (e.g.,  notes,\ncomments,\
    \ keywords) in the forwarding envelope.  Annotations are filed\nand retrieved\
    \ as part of the archived message.\nIn  the  case  of  batch-mode filing, only\
    \ the archiver's name and the\ndate and time s/he sent the package are  extracted\
    \  from  the  mailing\nenvelope.   The  message-body  portion  is then treated\
    \ as a series of\nindividual messages.\nNWG/RFC  744                         \

    C.  To Retrieve Messages\n    --------------------\nRetrievals are initiated by\
    \ sending a Retrieval Request  (which  is  a\nspecially   formatted  message)\
    \  to  \"MARS-Retriever@CCA\".   Retrieved\nmessages are mailed back, one at a\
    \ time, and will appear as  new  mail\nin the requester's mailbox.\nRetrieval\
    \  Request  messages  can be composed using any SNDMSG-type of\nprogram, as follows:\n\
    \   . The recipient of the RR message must be MARS-Retriever @ CCA\n   . Other\
    \ message header fields are ignored for now\n   . The message body portion of\
    \ the RR is used to compose Datalanguage\n     for performing the retrieval. \
    \ Its format resembles a message\n     header, or selected portions thereof.\n\
    The following list defines which field names are recognized, and  some\nnotes\
    \  on  their  interpretation.   The  scanning  of  each  field  is\nterminated\
    \ by a carriage-return.\n   DATE:     The format of the date field is day-month-year.\
    \  Use of\n             hyphens is optional.  This field will cause  only those\n\
    \             messages composed on the specified date to be retrieved.\n   AFTER:\
    \    Use of this field will  retrieve  messages  composed after\n            \
    \ the specified date.\n   SINCE:    This field is interpreted like the AFTER:\
    \ field.\n   BEFORE:   Use of this field will  retrieve  messages  composed before\n\
    \             the specified date.\n   UNTIL:    This field is interpreted like\
    \ the BEFORE: field.\n   FROM:     This field is expected to contain  a  valid\
    \  mailbox name.\n             The host specification is optional.  If more than\
    \ one name\n             is specified, ORing of  the  names  is implicit.\n  \
    \           Retrieval  based upon host specification alone has not been\n    \
    \         implemented.\n   TO:       This field is expected to contain one or\
    \ more  valid\n             mailbox  names.  The host specification is optional.\
    \ Spaces\n             and commas between the names imply AND.\nNWG/RFC  744 \
