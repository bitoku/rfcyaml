- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This document is intended to provide guidelines for the development\n\
    \   of collateral specifications describing the use of new encryption and\n  \
    \ authentication algorithms with the ESP protocol, described in [ESP]\n   and\
    \ new authentication algorithms used with the AH protocol,\n   described in [AH].\
    \  ESP and AH are part of the IP Security\n   architecture described in [Arch].\
    \  There is a requirement for a\n   well-known procedure that can be used to add\
    \ new encryption\n   algorithms or authentication algorithms to ESP and AH, not\
    \ only while\n   the initial document set is undergoing development but after\
    \ the base\n   documents have achieved RFC status.  Following the guidelines\n\
    \   discussed below simplifies adding new algorithms and reduces that\n   amount\
    \ of redundant documentation.\n   The goal in writing a new Encryption Algorithm\
    \ or Authentication\n   Algorithm document is to concentrate on the application\
    \ of the\n   specific algorithm within ESP and AH.  General ESP and AH concepts,\n\
    \   definitions, and issues are covered in the ESP and AH documents. The\n   algorithms\
    \ themselves are not described in these documents.  This\n   gives us the capability\
    \ to add new algorithms and also specify how\n   any given algorithm might interact\
    \ with other algorithms. The intent\n   is to achieve the goal of avoiding duplication\
    \ of information and\n   excessive numbers of documents, the so-called \"draft\
    \ explosion\"\n   effect.\n"
- title: 2. Interrelationship of IPsec Documents
  contents:
  - "2. Interrelationship of IPsec Documents\n   The documents describing the set\
    \ of IPsec protocols are divided into\n   seven groups.  This is illustrated in\
    \ Figure 1.  There is a main\n   Architecture document which broadly covers the\
    \ general concepts,\n   security requirements, definitions, and mechanisms defining\
    \ IPsec\n   technology.\n   There is an ESP Protocol document and an AH Protocol\
    \ document which\n   covers the packet format and general issues regarding the\
    \ respective\n   protocols.  These protocol documents also contain default values\
    \ if\n   appropriate, such as the default padding contents, and mandatory to\n\
    \   implement algorithms.  These documents dictate some of the values in\n   the\
    \ Domain Of Interpretation document [DOI].  Note the DOI document\n   is itself\
    \ part of the IANA Assigned Numbers mechanism and so the\n   values described\
    \ in the DOI are well-known.  See [DOI] for more\n   information on the mechanism.\n\
    \   The \"Encryption Algorithm\" document set, shown on the left, is the\n   set\
    \ of documents describing how various encryption algorithms are\n   used for ESP.\
    \  These documents are intended to fit in this roadmap,\n   and should avoid overlap\
    \ with the ESP protocol document and with the\n   Authentication Algorithm documents.\
    \  Examples of this document are\n   the [DES-Detroit] and [CBC] documents.  When\
    \ these or other\n   encryption algorithms are used for ESP, the DOI document\
    \ has to\n   indicate certain values, such as an encryption algorithm identifier,\n\
    \   so these documents provide input to the DOI.\n   The \"Authentication Algorithm\"\
    \ document set, shown on the right, is\n   the set of documents describing how\
    \ various authentication algorithms\n   are used for both ESP and AH.  These documents\
    \ are intended to fit in\n   this roadmap, and should avoid overlap with the AH\
    \ protocol document\n   and with the Encryption Algorithm documents.  Examples\
    \ of this\n   document are the [HMAC-MD5], and [HMAC-SHA-1] documents.  When these\n\
    \   or other algorithms are used for either ESP or AH, the DOI document\n   has\
    \ to indicate certain values, such as algorithm type, so these\n   documents provide\
    \ input to the DOI.\n   The \"Key Management Documents\", shown at the bottom,\
    \ are the\n   documents describing the IETF standards-track key management schemes.\n\
    \   These documents provide certain values for the DOI also.  Note that\n   issues\
    \ of key management should be indicated here and not in, for\n   example, the\
    \ ESP and AH protocol documents.  Currently this box\n   represents [ISAKMP],\
    \ [Oakley], and [Resolution].\n   The DOI document, shown in the middle, contains\
    \ values needed for the\n   other documents to relate to each other.  This includes\
    \ for example\n   encryption algorithms, authentication algorithms, and operational\n\
    \   parameters such as key lifetimes.\n                      +--------------+\n\

- title: 3. Keying Material
  contents:
  - "3. Keying Material\n   Describing the encryption and authentication algorithms\
    \ in different\n   documents raises the issue of how the key management protocols\
    \ knows\n   the required keying material length for the desired algorithms when\n\
    \   used together with ESP.  It also raises the issue of how to divide\n   the\
    \ keying material.  This is known as the \"slicing and dicing\"\n   information.\n\
    \   Each Encryption Algorithm and Authentication Algorithm document\n   should\
    \ specify their respective key attributes (e.g. how to pad,\n   location of parity\
    \ bits, key order for multi-keyed algorithms, and\n   length).  The key management\
    \ protocols should use the length of the\n   keys specified in the respective\
    \ Algorithm documents to generate the\n   keying material of required length.\n\
    \   The key management protocol generates keying material with enough\n   strength\
    \ and size to generate keys for individual algorithms. The\n   IPsec Architecture\
    \ document specifies how keys are extracted from a\n   single block of keying\
    \ material when multiple keys are required (e.g.\n   ESP with authentication).\
    \  The Encryption Algorithm and\n   Authentication Algorithm documents are responsible\
    \ for specifying the\n   key sizes and strengths for each algorithm. However,\
    \ whether the\n   entire keying material is passed down to the kernel to perform\n\
    \   slicing and dicing or if the keys are sliced and diced by key\n   management\
    \ protocol is an implementation issue. The AH protocol\n   document has no such\
    \ requirement.\n"

    \ and key lengths).  To help eliminate\n   some complexity involved with key management\
    \ having to negotiate\n   large numbers of algorithm-specific parameters, encryption\
