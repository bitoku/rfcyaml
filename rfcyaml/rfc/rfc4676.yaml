  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many end system services can benefit by knowing the approximate\n\
    \   location of the end device.  In particular, IP telephony devices need\n  \
    \ to know their location to contact the appropriate emergency response\n   agency\
    \ and to be found by emergency responders.\n   There are two common ways to identify\
    \ the location of an object,\n   either through geospatial coordinates or by so-called\
    \ civic\n   addresses.  Geospatial coordinates indicate longitude, latitude, and\n\
    \   altitude, while civic addresses indicate a street address.\n   The civic address\
    \ is commonly, but not necessarily, closely related\n   to the postal address,\
    \ used by the local postal service to deliver\n   mail.  However, not all postal\
    \ addresses correspond to street\n   addresses.  For example, the author's address\
    \ is a postal address\n   that does not appear on any street or building sign.\
    \  Naturally, post\n   office boxes would be unsuitable for the purposes described\
    \ here.\n   The term 'civil address' or 'jurisdictional address' is also\n   sometimes\
    \ used instead of civic address.  This document mainly\n   supports civic addresses,\
    \ but allows the postal community name to be\n   indicated if it differs from\
    \ the civic name.\n   A related document [15] describes a DHCPv4 [2] option for\
    \ conveying\n   geospatial information to a device.  This document describes how\n\
    \   DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 [6] can be used to convey the civic and postal\n   address\
    \ to devices.  Both geospatial and civic formats can be used\n   simultaneously,\
    \ increasing the chance to deliver accurate and timely\n   location information\
    \ to emergency responders.  The reader should also\n   be familiar with the concepts\
    \ in [11], as many of the protocol\n   elements below are designed to dovetail\
    \ with PIDF-LO elements.\n   This document only defines the delivery of location\
    \ information from\n   the DHCP server to the client, due to security concerns\
    \ related to\n   using DHCP to update the database.  Within the GEOPRIV architecture\n\
    \   as defined by RFC 3693 [9], the defined mechanism in this document\n   for\
    \ conveying initial location information is known as a \"sighting\"\n   function.\
    \  Sighting functions are not required to have security\n   capabilities and are\
    \ only intended to be configured in trusted and\n   controlled environments. \
    \ (A classic example of the sighting function\n   is a Global Positioning System\
    \ wired directly to a network node.)\n   Further discussion of the protections\
    \ that must be provided according\n   to RFC 3694 [10] are in the Security Considerations\
    \ (Section 6).\n   End systems that obtain location information via the mechanism\n\
    \   described here then use other protocol mechanisms to communicate this\n  \
    \ information to an emergency call center or to convey it as part of\n   presence\
    \ information.\n   Civic information is useful since it often provides additional,\n\
    \   human-usable information, particularly within buildings.  Also,\n   compared\
    \ to geospatial information, it is readily obtained for most\n   occupied structures\
    \ and can often be interpreted even if incomplete.\n   For example, for many large\
    \ university or corporate campuses,\n   geocoding information to building and\
    \ room granularity may not be\n   readily available.\n   Unlike geospatial information,\
    \ the format for civic and postal\n   information differs from country to country.\
    \  The initial set of data\n   fields is derived from standards published by the\
    \ United States\n   National Emergency Number Association (NENA) [18] and takes\
    \ into\n   account addressing conventions for a number of countries in different\n\
    \   areas of the world.  It is anticipated that other countries can reuse\n  \
    \ many of the data elements, but the document also establishes an IANA\n   registry\
    \ for defining additional civic location data fields.\n   The same civic and postal\
    \ address information can often be rendered\n   in multiple languages and scripts.\
    \  For example, Korean addresses are\n   often shown in Hangul, Latin, and Kanji,\
    \ while some older cities have\n   multiple language variants (e.g., Munich, Muenchen,\
    \ and Monaco).\n   Since DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 do not currently support a mechanism\
    \ to query\n   for a specific script or language, the DHCP server SHOULD provide\
    \ all\n   common renderings to the client and MUST provide at least the\n   rendering\
    \ in the language and script appropriate to the location\n   indicated.  For example,\
    \ for use in presence information, the target\n   may be visiting from a foreign\
    \ country and want to convey the\n   information in a format suitable for watchers\
    \ in its home country.\n   For emergency services, the rendering in the local\
    \ language is likely\n   to be most appropriate.  To provide multiple renderings,\
    \ the server\n   repeats sequences of address elements, prefixing each with a\n\
    \   'language' and/or 'script' element (see Section 3.3).  The language\n   and\
    \ script remain in effect for subsequent elements until overridden\n   by another\
    \ language or script element.  Since the DHCP client is\n   unlikely to be the\
    \ final consumer of the location information, the\n   DHCP server has to provide\
    \ all appropriate language and script\n   versions, which the client then passes\
    \ on via some other GEOPRIV\n   using protocol, typically encoded in a presence-based\
    \ GEOPRIV\n   location object format [16].\n   The DHCP server MAY provide location\
    \ information for multiple\n   locations related to the target, for example, both\
    \ the network\n   element and the network jack itself.  This is likely to help\
    \ in\n   debugging network problems, for example.\n   This document calls for\
    \ various operational decisions.  For example,\n   an administrator has to decide\
    \ when to provide the location of the\n   DHCP server or other network elements\
    \ even if these may be a good\n   distance away from the client.  The administrator\
    \ must also consider\n   whether to include both civic and geospatial information\
    \ if these may\n   differ.  The document does not specify the criteria to be used\
    \ in\n   making these choices, as these choices are likely to depend strongly\n\
    \   on local circumstances and need to be based on local, human\n   knowledge.\n\
    \   A system that works with location information configured by DHCP is\n   dependent\
    \ that the administrators of the DHCP systems are careful\n   enough on a number\
    \ of fronts, such as:\n   -  if information about one location is provided in\
    \ multiple forms\n      (e.g., in multiple languages), is it consistent?\n   -\
    \  is the administrator certain that location information is\n      configured\
    \ only to systems to which it applies (e.g., not to\n      systems topologically\
    \ near, but geographically far)?\n   -  if the location configured is not that\
    \ of the target but that of a\n      'nearby' network node or the DHCP server,\
    \ despite the\n      recommendation against this practice in Section 3.1, is the\n\
    \      administrator certain that this configuration is geographically\n     \
    \ valid?\n   There are many other considerations in ensuring that location\n \
    \  information is handled safely and promptly for an emergency service\n   in\
    \ particular.  Those are in the province of the applications which\n   make use\
    \ of the configured location information, and they are beyond\n   the scope of\
    \ this document.  DHCP configuration SHOULD NOT be used\n   for emergency services\
    \ without guidelines on these considerations.\n   Work on these is under way in\
    \ the IETF ECRIT working group at the\n   time of publication of this document.\n\
    \   In addition, if a network provides civic location information via\n   both\
    \ DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, the information conveyed by two protocols\n   MUST be the\
    \ same.\n   As discussed in the Security Considerations (Section 6), the\n   GEOCONF_CIVIC\
    \ option SHOULD be returned by DHCPv4 servers only when\n   the DHCPv4 client\
    \ has included this option in its 'parameter request\n   list' (RFC 2131 [2],\
    \ Section 3.5).  Similarly, the\n   OPTION_GEOCONF_CIVIC option SHOULD be returned\
    \ by DHCPv6 servers only\n   when the DHCPv6 client has included this option in\
    \ its OPTION_ORO.\n   The DHCPv4 long-options mechanism described in RFC 3396\
    \ [8] MUST be\n   used if the civic address option exceeds the maximum DHCPv4\
    \ option\n   size of 255 octets.\n"

    \   The CA types labeled in the second column correspond to items from\n   the\
    \ NENA \"Recommended Formats and Protocols For ALI Data Exchange,\n   ALI Response\
    \ and GIS Mapping\" [18], but are applicable to most\n   countries.  The \"NENA\"\
    \ column refers to the data dictionary name in\n   Exhibit 18 of [18].\n   The\
    \ column labeled PIDF indicates the element name from [16].  (Some\n   elements\
    \ were added to this document after the PIDF location object\n   definition had\
    \ been completed.  These elements currently do not have\n   a PIDF-LO equivalent.)\n\
    \   Language:  The \"language\" item (CAtype 0) optionally identifies the\n  \
    \    language used for presenting the address information, drawing from\n    \
    \  the tags for identifying languages in [4], as discussed in [13].\n      If\
    \ omitted, the default value for this tag is \"i-default\" [3].\n   Script:  The\
    \ \"script\" item (CAtype 128) optionally identifies the\n      script used for\
    \ presenting the address information, drawing from\n      the tags for identifying\
    \ scripts described in [12] and elaborated\n      on in Section 2.2.3 of [13].\
    \  If omitted, the default value for\n      this tag is \"Latn\".\n   POD, PRD:\
    \  The abbreviations N, E, S, W, and NE, NW, SE, SW SHOULD be\n      used for\
    \ POD (trailing street suffix) and PRD (leading street\n      direction) in English-speaking\
    \ countries.\n   STS:  STS designates a street suffix or type.  In the United\
    \ States\n      (US), the abbreviations recommended by the United States Postal\n\
    \      Service Publication 28 [17], Appendix C, SHOULD be used.\n   HNS:  HNS\
    \ (\"house number suffix\") is a modifier to a street address;\n      it does\
    \ not identify parts of a street address.\n   building:  While a landmark (LMK,\
    \ CAtype 21) can indicate a complex\n      of buildings, 'building' (CAtype 25)\
    \ conveys the name of a single\n      building if the street address includes\
    \ more than one building or\n      if the building name is helpful in identifying\
    \ the location.\n   LOC:  LOC (\"location\", CAtype 22) is an unstructured string\n\
    \      specifying additional information about the location, such as the\n   \
    \   part of a building or other unstructured information.\n   PCN:  The postal\
    \ community name (CAtype 30) and the post office box\n      (CAtype 31) allow\
    \ the recipient to construct a postal address.\n      The post office box field\
    \ should contain the words \"P.O. Box\" or\n      other locally appropriate postal\
    \ designation.\n   NAM:  The NAM object is used to aid user location (\"Joe Miller\"\
    ,\n      \"Alice's Dry Cleaning\").  It does not identify the person using a\n\
    \      communications device, but rather the person or organization\n      associated\
    \ with the address.\n   LMK:  While a landmark (LMK, CAtype 21) can indicate a\
    \ complex of\n      buildings, 'building' (CAtype 25) conveys the name of a single\n\
    \      building if the street address includes more than one building or\n   \
    \   the building name is helpful in identifying the location.  (For\n      example,\
    \ on university campuses, the house number is often not\n      displayed on buildings,\
    \ whereas the building name is prominently\n      shown.)\n   Unit:  The \"unit\"\
    \ object (CAtype 26) contains the name or number of a\n      part of a structure\
    \ where there are separate administrative units,\n      owners, or tenants, such\
    \ as separate companies or families that\n      occupy that structure.  Common\
    \ examples include suite or apartment\n      designations.\n   Room:  A \"room\"\
    \ (CAtype 28) is the smallest identifiable subdivision\n      of a structure.\n\
    \   Type of place:  The \"type of place\" item (CAtype 29) describes the\n   \
    \   type of place described by the civic coordinates.  For example, it\n     \
    \ describes whether it is a home, office, street, or other public\n      space.\
    \  The values are drawn from the items in the location types\n      registry [11].\
    \  This information makes it easy, for example, for\n      the DHCP client to\
    \ then populate the presence information.  Since\n      this is an IANA-registered\
    \ token, the language and script\n      designations do not apply for this element.\n\
    \   Additional code:  The \"additional code\" item (CAtype 32) provides an\n \
    \     additional, country-specific code identifying the location.  For\n     \
    \ example, for Japan, it contains the Japan Industry Standard (JIS)\n      address\
    \ code.  The JIS address code provides a unique address\n      inside of Japan,\
    \ down to the level of indicating the floor of the\n      building.\n   SEAT:\
    \  The \"seat\" item (CAtype 33) designates a place where a person\n      might\
    \ sit, such as a seat in a stadium or theater, or a cubicle in\n      an open-plan\
    \ office or a booth in a trade show.\n   Primary road name:  The \"primary road\"\
    \ item (CAtype 34) is given to\n      the road or street name associated with\
    \ the address.  If CAtypes\n      35 through 37 are not specified, the building\
    \ or designated\n      location is found on that street.  If some of CAtypes 35\
    \ through\n      37 are specified, this designates the main road, off of which\
    \ the\n      smaller streets branch off and where the structure or building is\n\
    \      actually located.\n   Road section:  The \"road section\" item (CAtype\
    \ 35) designates a\n      specific section or stretch of a primary road.  This\
    \ is a new\n      thoroughfare element and is useful where a primary road is divided\n\
    \      into sections that re-use the same street number ranges.\n   Branch road\
    \ name:  The \"branch road name\" item (CAtype 36) represents\n      the name\
    \ or identifier of a road or street that intersects or is\n      associated with\
    \ a primary road.  The branch road name is used only\n      in countries where\
    \ side streets do not have unique names within a\n      municipality or other\
    \ administrative unit, but rather must be\n      qualified by the name of the\
    \ primary road name that they branch\n      off of.\n   Sub-Branch road name:\
    \  The \"sub-branch road name\" (CAtype 37) item\n      represents the name of\
    \ a street that branches off a branch road\n      (CAtype 36).  The sub-branch\
    \ road name is used only in countries\n      where such streets are named relative\
    \ to the primary road name and\n      branch road that they connect with.\n  \
    \ Street name pre-modifier:  The \"street name pre-modifier\" (CAtype 38)\n  \
    \    is an optional element of the complete street name.  It is a word\n     \
    \ or phrase that precedes all other elements of the street name and\n      modifies\
    \ it, but is separated from the street name by a street\n      name pre-directional.\
    \  An example is \"Old\" in \"Old North First\n      Street\".\n   Street name\
    \ post-modifier:  The \"street name post-modifier\" (CAtype\n      39) is an optional\
    \ element of the complete street name.  It is a\n      word or phrase that follows\
    \ all other elements of the street name\n      and modifies it, but is separated\
    \ from the street name by a street\n      name post-directional and/or street\
    \ suffix.  An example is\n      \"Extended\" in \"East End Avenue Extended\".\n"
- title: 4.  Postal Addresses
  contents:
  - "4.  Postal Addresses\n   In general, a recipient can construct a postal address\
    \ by using all\n   language-appropriate elements, including the postal code (ZIP,\
    \ CAtype\n   24).  However, certain elements override the civic address components\n\
    \   to create a postal address.  If the elements include a post office\n   box\
    \ (CAtype 31), the street address components (CAtype 34, PRD, POD,\n   STS, HNO,\
    \ HNS) are replaced with the post office box element.  If a\n   postal community\
    \ name is specified, the civic community name\n   (typically, A3) is replaced\
    \ by the postal community name (PCN, CAtype\n   30).  Country-specific knowledge\
    \ is required to create a valid postal\n   address.  The formating of such addresses\
    \ is beyond the scope of this\n   document.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations discussed in the\
    \ GEOPRIV architecture\n   defined by RFC 3693 [9] apply.\n   Where critical decisions\
    \ might be based on the value of this\n   GEOCONF_CIVIC option, DHCPv4 authentication\
    \ in RFC 3118 [5] SHOULD be\n   used to protect the integrity of the DHCP options.\n\
    \   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an\n   eavesdropper\
    \ who can monitor the link between the DHCP server and\n   requesting client can\
    \ discover the information contained in this\n   option.  Thus, usage of this\
    \ option on networks without access\n   restrictions or network-layer or link-layer\
    \ privacy mechanisms is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.\n   To minimize the unintended exposure\
    \ of location information, the\n   GEOCONF_CIVIC option SHOULD be returned by\
    \ DHCPv4 servers only when\n   the DHCPv4 client has included this option in its\
    \ 'parameter request\n   list' (RFC 2131 [2], Section 3.5).  Similarly, the\n\
    \   OPTION_GEOCONF_CIVIC option SHOULD be returned by DHCPv6 servers only\n  \
    \ when the DHCPv6 client has included this option in its OPTION_ORO.\n   After\
    \ initial location information has been introduced, it MUST be\n   afforded the\
    \ protections defined in RFC 3694 [10].  Therefore,\n   location information SHOULD\
    \ NOT be sent from a DHCP client to a DHCP\n   server.  If a client decides to\
    \ send location information to the\n   server, it is implicitly granting that\
    \ server unlimited retention and\n   distribution permissions.\n"
- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   The IANA has registered new DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 option\
    \ codes for the\n   Civic Address (GEOCONF_CIVIC and OPTION_GEOCONF_CIVIC, respectively).\n\
    \   This document establishes a new IANA registry for CAtypes designating\n  \
    \ civic address components.  Referring to RFC 2434 [14], this registry\n   operates\
    \ under both \"Expert Review\" and \"Specification Required\"\n   rules.  The\
    \ IESG will appoint an Expert Reviewer who will advise IANA\n   promptly on each\
    \ request for a new or updated CAtype.\n   CAtype:  Numeric identifier, assigned\
    \ by IANA.\n   Brief description:  Short description identifying the meaning of\
    \ the\n      element.\n   Reference to published specification:  A stable reference\
    \ to an RFC\n      or other permanent and readily available reference, in sufficient\n\
    \      detail so that interoperability between independent\n      implementations\
    \ is possible.\n   Country-specific considerations:  If applicable, notes whether\
    \ the\n      element is only applicable or defined for certain countries.\n  \
    \ The initial list of registrations is contained in Section 3.4.\n   Updates to\
    \ country-specific considerations for previously-defined\n   CAtypes are not defined\
    \ by IANA registrations since they are purely\n   descriptive, not a registration\
    \ of identifiers.  As noted earlier,\n   country-specific conventions may optionally\
    \ be written up in\n   documents titled \"Civic Addresses for [Country]\".\n"
