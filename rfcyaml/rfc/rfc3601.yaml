  - "Abstract\n   This memo describes the full set of notations needed to represent
    a\n   text string in a Dial Sequence.  A Dial Sequence is normally composed\n
    \  of Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) elements, plus separators and\n   additional
    \"actions\" (such as \"wait for dialtone\", \"pause for N\n   secs\", etc.) which
    could be needed to successfully establish the\n   connection with the target service:
    \ this includes the cases where\n   subaddresses or DTMF menu navigation apply.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Since the very first devices interacting with GSTN services
    appeared,\n   a need for a unique text string representation of commonly called\n
    \  telephone numbers, and more generally DTMF sequences and actions, was\n   foreseen.\n
    \  This memo describes the full text string representation method.  This\n   specification
    was explicitly created to provide an easy, unique and\n   complete reference which
    MUST be used by all other specifications\n   needing a text string representation
    for a Dial Sequence.\n   The specification was collected directly from Dial Sequence\n
    \  definitions which are already described in existing Standard Track\n   specifications
    (such as [6] [7] [8] [9]), and is fully synchronized\n   with them.  Full compatibility
    is thus assured, and as a consequence,\n   this specification results in a compendium
    of existing definitions.\n   This notation is a fully compatible compendium of
    existing notations,\n   and should be used in all specifications needing a text
    string\n   representation of a Dial Sequence.\n   Although the commonly called
    \"telephone numbers\" are normally used to\n   generate a Dial Sequence when establishing
    a connection, the full\n   abstract E.164 addresses [2], i.e., the universal addressing
    on the\n   Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN), have further elements which\n
    \  cannot be dialled.  Thus abstract E.164 addresses cannot be fully\n   converted
    into a Dial Sequence or fully represented using this\n   notation.\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Terminology and Syntax conventions\n   In this document the formal definitions
      are described using ABNF\n   syntax, as defined in [3].  This memo also uses
      some of the \"CORE\n   DEFINITIONS\" defined in \"APPENDIX A - CORE\" of that
      document.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
      \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and
      \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
      14, RFC 2119 [4].\n   The following terms are also defined in this document:\n
      \     Dial Sequence:\n         a series of DTMF elements and human or device
      \"actions\";\n      phone-string:\n         a text representation of a Dial
      Sequence;\n      GSTN address:  a commonly called \"telephone number\" on the
      GSTN,\n         i.e., a diallable subset of an E.164 abstract address or any\n
      \        private numbering schema diallable address;\n      gstn-phone:\n         a
      text representation of a GSTN address;\n      subaddr-string:\n         a text
      representation of a GSTN subaddress (which includes ISDN\n         subaddresses
      [2] and T.33 subaddresses [5]);\n      post-dial:\n         a text representation
      of a post dialling sequence.\n"

  - "2.  The \"Dial Sequence\" definition\n   The possible elements composing a Dial
    Sequence can vary from a\n   minimum number, up to a really large and complex
    collection: in fact,\n   the sequences already needed to dial a gstn-phone, which
    is a subset\n   of the generic Dial Sequence, well represents this variety and\n
    \  complexity of cases.\n   In particular, a Dial Sequence is composed by:\n   -
    \ \"DTMF elements\": normally available as \"keys\" on numeric keypads\n      of
    dialling devices;\n   -  \"actions\": normally performed by the agent (human or
    device)\n      composing the Dial Sequence;\n   -  \"separators\": used only to
    improve human readability of a Dial\n      Sequence.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  The \"phone-string\" definition\n   The text representation of the Dial
      Sequence elements is defined in\n   the phone-string specification:\n      phone-string
      = 1*( DTMF / pause / tonewait / written-sep )\n      DTMF = ( DIGIT / \"#\"
      / \"*\" / \"A\" / \"B\" / \"C\" / \"D\" )\n                     ; special DTMF
      codes like \"*\", \"#\", \"A\", \"B\",\n                     ; \"C\", \"D\"
      are defined in [1].\n                     ; Important Note: these elements only
      apply for\n                     ; alphabetic strings used in DTMF operations.\n
      \                    ; They are NOT applicable for the alphabetic\n                     ;
      characters that are mapped to digits on phone\n                     ; keypads
      in some countries.\n      pause = \"p\"\n      tonewait = \"w\"\n      written-sep
      = ( \"-\" / \".\" )\n   Note:\n      DTMF are the \"DTMF elements\", pause and
      tonewait are the \"actions\"\n      and written-sep are the \"separators\".\n
      \  The \"pause\" and \"tonewait\" elements interpretation of the phone-\n   string
      depends on the specific devices and implementation using the\n   specification.
      \ Thus their exact meaning is not mandated in this\n   document.  The next section
      provides some examples drawn from common\n   practice.  Both \"pause\" and \"tonewait\"
      are case insensitive.\n   Implementation of \"pause\" and \"tonewait\":\n      -
      \ one instance of a \"pause\" SHOULD be interpreted as a pause of\n         one
      second between the preceding and succeeding dial string\n         elements;\n
      \     -  a \"tonewait\" SHOULD be interpreted as a pause that will last\n         until
      the calling party hears a dial tone or another indication\n         that more
      dial string characters may be processed.  An off-hook\n         indication MAY
      also be interpreted as this kind of indication\n         (meaning that the audio
      channel has been opened to the\n         receiving party);\n      -  because
      these characters are not a part of the GSTN subscriber\n         address (telephone
      number) per se, any dial string characters\n         that succeed either a \"pause\"
      or \"tonewait\" SHOULD be sent\n         using DTMF signalling.\n   The use
      of written-sep elements is allowed in order to improve human\n   readability
      of the phone-string.  The written-sep are elements which\n   can be placed between
      dial elements, such as digits etc.  Any\n   occurrences of written-sep elements
      in a phone-string MUST NOT result\n   in any action.  Conformant implementations
      MAY drop or insert\n   written-sep into the phone-string they handle.\n   The
      phone-string definition is used in the following sections to\n   explicitly
      describe the encoding of some specific subcases where it\n   applies.\n"

- contents:
  - "3.  The \"gstn-phone\" definition\n   In order to access a GSTN address, a human
    or a device must perform a\n   Dial Sequence.  Thus, a GSTN address can be represented
    using the\n   phone-string elements.  In particular, diallable E.164 numeric\n
    \  addresses [2] represent a limited subset of all possible GSTN\n   addresses,
    while the complete complex case needs a full encoding\n   schema, as it also includes
    a local or private addressing schema.\n   In order to describe this distinction
    and provide anyhow a complete\n   encoding schema, the following definition of
    \"gstn-phone\" is\n   provided:\n      gstn-phone = ( global-phone / local-phone
    )\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  The \"global-phone\" definition\n   The purpose of the global-phone element
      is to represent diallable\n   E.164 numeric addresses.  As such, it uses a subset
      of a phone-string\n   definition only.\n   The syntax for a global-phone element
      is as follows:\n      global-phone = \"+\" 1*( DIGIT / written-sep )\n   Any
      other dialling schemes MUST NOT use the leading \"+\" defined here.\n   The
      \"+\" sign is strictly reserved for the standard \"global-phone\"\n   syntax,
      and, even if not specifically part of the phone-string\n   definition, it is
      needed to uniquely label a global-phone.\n"
    title: 3.1.  The "global-phone" definition
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  The \"local-phone\" definition\n   The local-phone element is intended
      to represent the set of possible\n   cases where the global-phone numbering
      schema does not apply.  Given\n   the different and complex conventions currently
      being used in the\n   GSTN system, the local-phone definition supports a large
      number of\n   elements.\n   The detailed syntax for local-phone elements is
      as follows:\n      local-phone =  [ exit-code ] dial-number\n      local-phone
      =/ exit-code [ dial-number ]\n      exit-code = phone-string\n                  ;
      this will include elements such as the digit to\n                  ; access
      outside line, the long distance carrier\n                  ; access code, the
      access password to the service,\n                  ; etc...\n      dial-number
      = phone-string\n                  ; this is in many cases composed of different
      elements\n                  ; such as the local phone number, the area code\n
      \                 ; (if needed), the international country code\n                  ;
      (if needed), etc...\n   Notes:\n      The \"+\" character is reserved for use
      in a global-phone and MUST\n      NOT be used in a local-phone string;\n      Please
      note that a local-phone string MUST NOT be a null string,\n      i.e., at least
      an exit-code, or a dial-number or both MUST be\n      present.\n"

  - "4.  The \"subaddr-string\" definition\n   In GSTN service, there are cases where
    a subaddress is required to\n   specify the final destination.  To specify these
    subaddresses, a Dial\n   Sequence is also used, and thus the \"subaddr-string\"
    can be encoded\n   as:\n      subaddr-string = phone-string\n   Note:\n      Within
    actual uses of subaddresses, some specific services can\n      limit the possible
    set of phone-string elements allowed.  In\n      particular, there are ISDN subaddresses
    [2] [8], which restrict\n      the phone-string elements to 1*( DIGIT / written-sep
    ) and service\n      specific subaddresses, like the fax service T.33 subaddress
    [5]\n      [7], which restrict phone-string elements to 1*( DIGIT ).\n"

  - "5.  The \"post-dial\" definition\n   In some cases, after the connection with
    the destination GSTN device\n   has been established, a further dialling sequence
    is required to\n   access further services.  A typical example is an automated
    menu-\n   driven service using DTMF sequences. These cases may be represented\n
    \  using the \"post-dial\" definition below:\n      post-dial = phone-string\n"

    \  Sequences, including GSTN and diallable E.164 addresses, and thus\n   provides
    a unique common representation method both for standard\n   protocols and applications.\n
    \  Some definitions, like these corresponding to an alias of the generic\n   phone-string
    element, are somewhat a theoretical distinction; however\n   they are useful to
    provide a more subtle distinction, allowing other\n   specifications to be more
    exact in a consistent way.\n   The proposal is consistent with existing standard
