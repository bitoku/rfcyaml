  title: 2.  Standards Language

  - "3.  De-Jitter Buffer Operation\n   A de-jitter buffer is required to absorb delay
    variation in the\n   network delivery of media packets.  A de-jitter buffer works
    by\n   holding media data for a period of time after it is received and\n   before
    it is played out.  Packets that arrive early are held in the\n   de-jitter buffer
    longer.  If packets arrive too early, they may be\n   discarded if there is no
    available de-jitter buffer space.  If\n   packets are delayed excessively by the
    network, they may be discarded\n   if they miss their playout time.\n   The de-jitter
    buffer can be considered a time window with the early\n   edge aligned with the
    delay corresponding to the earliest arriving\n   packet and the late edge representing
    the maximum permissible delay\n   before a late arriving packet would be discarded.
    \ The delay applied\n   to packets that arrive on time or at their expected arrival
    time is\n   known as the nominal delay, and this is equivalent to the time\n   difference/buffer
    size difference between the insertion point of the\n   on-time packets and the
    point at which the packets are read out.\n   The reference for the expected arrival
    time may be, for example, the\n   first packet in the session or the running average
    delay.  If all\n   packets arrived at their expected arrival time, then every
    packet\n   would be held in the de-jitter buffer exactly the nominal delay.\n
    \  The de-jitter buffer maximum delay is the delay that is applied to\n   the
    earliest arriving packet that is not discarded and corresponds to\n   the early
    edge of the de-jitter buffer time window.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Idealized De-Jitter Buffer\n   In practice, de-jitter buffer implementations
      vary considerably;\n   however, they should behave in a manner conceptually
      consistent with\n   an idealized de-jitter buffer, which is described as follows:\n
      \  (i)    Receive the first packet and delay playout by D ms.  Keep the\n          RTP
      timestamp (TS) and receive time as a reference.\n          RTP TS[1]\n          receive
      time[1]\n          Assume that both are normalized in ticks (there are 10,000\n
      \         ticks in a millisecond).\n   (ii)   Receive the next packet.\n   (iii)
      \ Calculate r = RTP TS[n] - RTP TS[1] and t = receive time[n] -\n          receive
      time[1].  If r == t, then the packet arrived on time.\n          If r < t, then
      the packet arrived late, and if r > t, then the\n          packet arrived early.\n
      \  (iv)   Delay playout of packet by D + (r-t).\n   (v)    Go back to (ii).\n
      \  Note that this idealized implementation assumes that the sender's RTP\n   clock
      is synchronized to the clock in the receiver, which is used to\n   timestamp
      packet arrivals.  If there is no such inherent\n   synchronization, the system
      may need to use an adaptive de-jitter\n   buffer or other techniques to ensure
      reliable reception.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Fixed De-Jitter Buffer\n   A fixed de-jitter buffer lacks provision to
      track the condition of\n   the network and has a fixed size, and packets leaving
      the de-jitter\n   buffer have a constant delay.  For fixed de-jitter buffer\n
      \  implementation, the nominal delay is set to a constant value\n   corresponding
      to the packets that arrive at their expected arrival\n   time, while the maximum
      delay is set to a constant value\n   corresponding to the fixed size of the
      de-jitter buffer.\n"

    - "3.3.  Adaptive De-Jitter Buffer\n   An adaptive de-jitter buffer can adapt
      to the change in the network's\n   delay and has variable size or variable delay.
      \ It allows the nominal\n   delay to be set to a low value initially to minimize
      user perceived\n   delay; however, it can automatically extend the late edge
      (and\n   possibly also retract the early edge) of a buffer window if a\n   significant
      proportion of the packets are arriving late (and hence\n   being discarded).\n"

      is used to indicate whether the de-jitter buffer\n      metrics are Sampled,
      Interval, or Cumulative metrics:\n         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported
      value is a sampled\n         instantaneous value.\n         I=10: Interval Duration
      - the reported value applies to the\n         most recent measurement interval
      duration between successive\n         metrics reports.\n         I=11: Cumulative
      Duration - the reported value applies to the\n         accumulation period characteristic
      of cumulative measurements.\n      In this document, de-jitter buffer metrics
      can only be sampled and\n      cannot be measured over definite intervals.  Also,
      the value I=00\n      is reserved for future use.  Senders MUST NOT use the

      (C): 1 bit\n      This field is used to identify the de-jitter buffer method
      in use\n      at the receiver, according to the following code:\n         0
      = Fixed de-jitter buffer\n         1 = Adaptive de-jitter buffer\n   Reserved
      (resv): 5 bits\n      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by

      Length: 16 bits\n      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus

      buffer nominal delay (DJB nominal): 16 bits\n      This is the current nominal
      de-jitter buffer delay (in\n      milliseconds) that corresponds to the nominal
      de-jitter buffer\n      delay for packets that arrive exactly on time.  It is
      calculated\n      based on the time spent in the de-jitter buffer for the packet\n
      \     that arrives exactly on time.  This parameter MUST be provided for\n      both
      fixed and adaptive de-jitter buffer implementations.\n      The measured value
      is an unsigned value.  If the measured value\n      exceeds 0xFFFD, the value
      0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an\n      over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the\n      value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.\n   De-jitter
      buffer maximum delay (DJB maximum): 16 bits\n      This is the current maximum
      de-jitter buffer delay (in\n      milliseconds) that corresponds to the earliest
      arriving packet\n      that would not be discarded.  It is calculated based
      on the time\n      spent in the de-jitter buffer for the earliest arriving packet.\n
      \     In simple queue implementations, this may correspond to the size\n      of
      the de-jitter buffer.  In adaptive de-jitter buffer\n      implementations,
      this value may vary dynamically.  This parameter\n      MUST be provided for
      both fixed and adaptive de-jitter buffer\n      implementations.\n      The
      measured value is an unsigned value.  If the measured value\n      exceeds 0xFFFD,
      the value 0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an\n      over-range measurement.
      \ If the measurement is unavailable, the\n      value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.\n
      \  De-jitter buffer high-water mark (DJB high-water mark): 16 bits\n      This
      is the highest value of the de-jitter buffer nominal delay\n      (in milliseconds)
      that occurred at any time during the reporting\n      interval.  This parameter
      MUST be provided for adaptive de-jitter\n      buffer implementations, and its
      value MUST be set to DJB maximum\n      for fixed de-jitter buffer implementations.\n
      \     The measured value is an unsigned value.  If the measured value\n      exceeds

  - "Appendix A.  Metrics Represented Using the Template from RFC 6390\n   a.  De-Jitter
    Buffer Nominal Delay Metric\n       *  Metric Name: De-jitter buffer nominal delay
    in RTP\n       *  Metric Description: The \"expected arrival time\" is the time\n
    \         that an RTP packet would arrive if there was no delay\n          variation.
    \ The delay applied to packets that arrive at their\n          expected time is
    known as the Nominal Delay.\n       *  Method of Measurement or Calculation: See
    Section 4.2,\n          de-jitter buffer nominal delay definition.\n       *  Units
    of Measurement: See Section 4.2, de-jitter buffer\n          nominal delay definition.\n
    \      *  Measurement Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain: See\n          Section
    4.\n       *  Measurement Timing: See Section 4 for measurement timing and\n          Section
    4.2 for Interval Metric flag.\n       *  Use and Applications: See Section 1.4.\n
    \      *  Reporting Model: See RFC 3611.\n   b.  De-Jitter Buffer Maximum Delay
    Metric\n       *  Metric Name: De-jitter buffer maximum delay in RTP.\n       *
    \ Metric Description: It is the current maximum de-jitter buffer\n          delay
    for RTP traffic that corresponds to the earliest\n          arriving packet that
    would not be discarded.\n       *  Method of Measurement or Calculation: See Section
    4.2,\n          de-jitter buffer maximum delay definition and Section 3, the\n
    \         last paragraph.\n       *  Units of Measurement: See Section 4.2, de-jitter
    buffer\n          maximum delay definition.\n       *  Measurement Point(s) with
    Potential Measurement Domain: See\n          Section 4.\n       *  Measurement
    Timing: See Section 4 for measurement timing and\n          Section 4.2 for Interval
    Metric flag.\n       *  Use and Applications: See Section 1.4.\n       *  Reporting
    Model: See RFC 3611.\n   c.  De-Jitter Buffer High-Water Mark Metric\n       *
    \ Metric Name: De-jitter buffer high-water mark in RTP.\n       *  Metric Description:
    It is the highest value of the de-jitter\n          buffer nominal delay for RTP
    traffic which occurred at any\n          time during the reporting interval.\n
    \      *  Method of Measurement or Calculation: See Section 4.2,\n          de-jitter
    buffer high-water mark definition.\n       *  Units of Measurement: See Section
    4.2, de-jitter buffer\n          nominal delay definition.\n       *  Measurement
    Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain: See\n          Section 4.\n       *
    \ Measurement Timing: See Section 4 for measurement timing and\n          Section
    4.2 for Interval Metric flag.\n       *  Use and Applications: See Section 1.4.\n
    \      *  Reporting Model: See RFC 3611.\n   d.  De-Jitter Buffer Low-Water Mark
    Metric\n       *  Metric Name: De-jitter buffer low-water mark in RTP.\n       *
    \ Metric Description: It is the lowest value of the de-jitter\n          buffer
    nominal delay (for RTP traffic) that occurred at any\n          time during the
    reporting interval.\n       *  Method of Measurement or Calculation: See Section
    4.2,\n          de-jitter buffer low-water mark definition.\n       *  Units of
    Measurement: See Section 4.2, de-jitter buffer low\n          water mark definition.\n
    \      *  Measurement Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain: See\n          Section
    4, 1st paragraph.\n       *  Measurement Timing: See Section 4 for measurement
    timing and\n          Section 4.2 for Interval Metric flag.\n       *  Use and
    Applications: See Section 1.4.\n       *  Reporting Model: See RFC 3611.\n"
