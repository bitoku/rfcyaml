  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies:\n   *  the digital signature algorithm\
    \ and parameters;\n   *  the hash algorithm and parameters;\n   *  the public\
    \ and private key formats; and,\n   *  the signature format\n   used by Resource\
    \ Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) subscribers when\n   they apply digital signatures\
    \ to certificates, Certificate Revocation\n   Lists (CRLs), and signed objects\
    \ (e.g., Route Origin Authorizations\n   (ROAs) and manifests).  Relying parties\
    \ (RPs) also use the algorithms\n   defined in this document to verify RPKI subscribers'\
    \ digital\n   signatures [RFC6480].\n   This document is referenced by other RPKI\
    \ profiles and\n   specifications, including the RPKI Certificate Policy (CP)\

- title: 2.  Algorithms
  contents:
  - "2.  Algorithms\n   Two cryptographic algorithms are used in the RPKI:\n     \
    \ *  The signature algorithm used in certificates, CRLs, and signed\n        \
    \ objects is RSA Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1\n         Version\
    \ 1.5 (sometimes referred to as \"RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5\") from\n         Section\
    \ 5 of [RFC4055].\n      *  The hashing algorithm used in certificates, CRLs,\
    \ and signed\n         objects is SHA-256 [SHS].  The hashing algorithm is not\n\
    \         identified by itself when used in certificates and CRLs, as\n      \
    \   they are combined with the digital signature algorithm (see\n         below).\n\
    \         When used in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) SignedData,\n  \
    \       the hash algorithm (in this case, the hash algorithm is\n         sometimes\
    \ called a message digest algorithm) is identified by\n         itself.  For CMS\
    \ SignedData, the object identifier and\n         parameters for SHA-256 (as defined\
    \ in [RFC5754]) MUST be used\n         when populating the digestAlgorithms and\
    \ digestAlgorithm\n         fields.\n         NOTE: The exception to the above\
    \ hashing algorithm is the use\n         of SHA-1 [SHS] when Certification Authorities\
    \ (CAs) generate\n         authority and subject key identifiers [RFC6487].\n\
    \   When used to generate and verify digital signatures the hash and\n   digital\
    \ signature algorithms are referred together, i.e., \"RSA PKCS#1\n   v1.5 with\
    \ SHA-256\" or more simply \"RSA with SHA-256\".  The Object\n   Identifier (OID)\
    \ sha256withRSAEncryption from [RFC4055] MUST be used.\n   Locations for this\
    \ OID are as follows:\n      In the certificate, the OID appears in the signature\
    \ and\n      signatureAlgorithm fields [RFC4055];\n      In the CRL, the OID appears\
    \ in the signatureAlgorithm field\n      [RFC4055];\n      In CMS SignedData,\
    \ the OID appears in each SignerInfo\n      signatureAlgoithm field [RFC3370]\
    \ using the OID from above; and,\n      In a certification request, the OID appears\
    \ in the PKCS #10\n      signatureAlgorithm field [RFC2986] or in the Certificate\
    \ Request\n      Message Format (CRMF) POPOSigningKey signature field [RFC4211].\n"
- title: 3.  Asymmetric Key Pair Formats
  contents:
  - "3.  Asymmetric Key Pair Formats\n   The RSA key pairs used to compute the signatures\
    \ MUST have a 2048-bit\n   modulus and a public exponent (e) of 65,537.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Public Key Format
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Public Key Format\n   The subject's public key is included in subjectPublicKeyInfo\n\
    \   [RFC5280].  It has two sub-fields: algorithm and subjectPublicKey.\n   The\
    \ values for the structures and their sub-structures follow:\n   algorithm (which\
    \ is an AlgorithmIdentifier type):\n      The object identifier for RSA PKCS#1\
    \ v1.5 with SHA-256 MUST be\n      used in the algorithm field, as specified in\
    \ Section 5 of\n      [RFC4055].  The value for the associated parameters from\
    \ that\n      clause MUST also be used for the parameters field.\n   subjectPublicKey:\n\
    \      RSAPublicKey MUST be used to encode the certificate's\n      subjectPublicKey\
    \ field, as specified in [RFC4055].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Private Key Format\n   Local policy determines the private key format.\n"
- title: 4.  Signature Format
  contents:
  - "4.  Signature Format\n   The structure for the certificate's signature field\
    \ is as specified\n   in Section 1.2 of [RFC4055].  The structure for the CMS\
    \ SignedData's\n   signature field is as specified in [RFC3370].\n"
- title: 5.  Additional Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  Additional Requirements\n   It is anticipated that the RPKI will require\
    \ the adoption of updated\n   key sizes and a different set of signature and hash\
    \ algorithms over\n   time, in order to maintain an acceptable level of cryptographic\n\
    \   security to protect the integrity of signed products in the RPKI.\n   This\
    \ profile should be replaced to specify such future requirements,\n   as and when\
    \ appropriate.\n   CAs and RPs SHOULD be capable of supporting a transition to\
    \ allow for\n   the phased introduction of additional encryption algorithms and\
    \ key\n   specifications, and also accommodate the orderly deprecation of\n  \
    \ previously specified algorithms and keys.  Accordingly, CAs and RPs\n   SHOULD\
    \ be capable of supporting multiple RPKI algorithm and key\n   profiles simultaneously\
    \ within the scope of such anticipated\n   transitions.  The recommended procedures\
    \ to implement such a\n   transition of key sizes and algorithms is not specified\
    \ in this\n   document.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The Security Considerations of [RFC4055], [RFC5280],\
    \ and [RFC6487]\n   apply to certificates and CRLs.  The Security Considerations\
    \ of\n   [RFC5754] apply to signed objects.  No new security threats are\n   introduced\
    \ as a result of this specification.\n"
