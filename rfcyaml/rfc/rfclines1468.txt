This document describes the encoding used in electronic mail [RFC822] and network news [RFC1036] messages in several Japanese networks.
It was first specified by and used in JUNET [JUNET].
The encoding is now also widely used in Japanese IP communities.
The name given to this encoding is "ISO 2022 JP", which is intended to be used in the "charset" parameter field of MIME headers (see [MIME1] and [MIME2]).
The text starts in ASCII [ASCII], and switches to Japanese characters through an escape sequence.
For example, the escape sequence ESC $ B (three bytes, hexadecimal values: 1B 24 42) indicates that the bytes following this escape sequence are Japanese characters, which are encoded in two bytes each.
To switch back to ASCII, the escape sequence ESC ( B is used.
The following table gives the escape sequences and the character sets used in ISO 2022 JP messages.
The ISOREG number is the registration number in ISO's registry [ISOREG].
( J    JIS X 0201 1976
87 Note that JIS X 0208 was called JIS C 6226 until the name was changed on March 1st, 1987.
Likewise, JIS C 6220 was renamed JIS X 0201.
The "Roman" character set of JIS X 0201
The backslash is replaced by the Yen sign, and the tilde is replaced by overline.
This set is Japan's national variant of ISO 646 [ISO646].
The JIS X 0208 [JISX0208] character sets consist of Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana and some other symbols and characters.
Each character takes up two bytes.
For further details about the JIS Japanese national character set standards, refer to [JISX0201] and [JISX0208].
For further information about the escape sequences, see [ISO2022] and [ISOREG].
If there are JIS X 0208 characters on a line, there must be a switch to ASCII or to the "Roman" set of JIS X 0201 before the end of the line (i.e., before the CRLF).
This means that the next line starts in the character set that was switched to before the end of the previous line.
Also, the text must end in ASCII.
Other restrictions are given in the Formal Syntax below.
The notational conventions used here are identical to those used in RFC 822 [RFC822].
The   (asterisk) convention is as follows:
l m something meaning at least l and at most m somethings, with l and m taking default values of 0 and infinity, respectively.
single byte seq 1 single byte char double byte segment
double byte seq 1 ( one of 94 one of 94 )
; ( 0 177,  0.
The name given to the JUNET character encoding is "ISO 2022 JP".
This name is intended to be used in MIME messages as follows:
Content Type: text/plain; charset iso
2022 JP encoding is already in 7 bit form, so it is not necessary to use a Content Transfer Encoding header.
It should be noted that applying the Base64 or Quoted Printable encoding will render the message unreadable in current JUNET software.
ISO 2022 JP may also be used in MIME Part 2 headers.
The "B" encoding should be used with ISO 2022 JP text.
The JUNET encoding was described in the JUNET User's Guide [JUNET]
The encoding is based on the particular usage of ISO 2022 announced by 4/1 (see [ISO2022] for details).
However, the escape sequence normally used for this announcement is not included in ISO 2022 JP messages.
The Kana set of JIS X 0201 is not used in ISO 2022 JP messages.
In the past, some systems erroneously used the escape sequence ESC ( H in JUNET messages.
This escape sequence is officially registered for a Swedish character set [ISOREG], and should not be used in ISO  2022 JP messages.
However, when relaying a message to another system, the escape sequences must not be altered in any way.
Each JIS X 0208 character takes up two columns, and the escape sequences do not take up any columns.
The implementor is reminded that JIS X 0208 characters take up two bytes and should not be split in the middle to break lines for displaying, etc.
The JIS X 0208 standard was revised in 1990, to add two characters at the end of the table.
Although ISO 2022 specifies special additional escape sequences to indicate the use of revised character sets, it is suggested here not to make use of this special escape sequence in ISO 2022 JP text, even if the two characters added to JIS X 0208 in 1990 are used.
