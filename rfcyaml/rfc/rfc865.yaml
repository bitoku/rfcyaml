  - "TCP Based Character Generator Service\n   One quote of the day service is defined
    as a connection based\n   application on TCP.  A server listens for TCP connections
    on TCP port\n   17.  Once a connection is established a short message is sent
    out the\n   connection (and any data received is thrown away).  The service\n
    \  closes the connection after sending the quote.\n"

  - "UDP Based Character Generator Service\n   Another quote of the day service is
    defined as a datagram based\n   application on UDP.  A server listens for UDP
    datagrams on UDP port\n   17.  When a datagram is received, an answering datagram
    is sent\n   containing a quote (the data in the received datagram is ignored).\n"

  - "Quote Syntax\n   There is no specific syntax for the quote.  It is recommended
    that it\n   be limited to the ASCII printing characters, space, carriage return,\n
    \  and line feed.  The quote may be just one or up to several lines, but\n   it
    should be less than 512 characters.\n"
