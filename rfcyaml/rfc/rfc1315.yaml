- title: 1.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n   RFC 1155 which defines\
    \ the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing\n   and naming objects for the purpose\
    \ of management.  RFC 1212 defines a\n   more concise description mechanism, which\
    \ is wholly consistent with\n   the SMI.\n   RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the\
    \ core set of managed objects for the\n   Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213\
    \ defines MIB-II, an evolution\n   of MIB-I based on implementation experience\
    \ and new operational\n   requirements.\n   RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the\
    \ protocol used for network access\n   to managed objects.\n   The Framework permits\
    \ new objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.  Objects
  contents:
  - "2.  Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]\n   defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.\
    \  The name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which\
    \ specifies an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance\
    \ serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For\
    \ human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n  \
    \ DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type\
    \ defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that object type. \
    \ The ASN.1 language is used for\n   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely\
    \ restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are\
    \ explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The encoding of an object type is simply\
    \ how that object type is\n   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly\
    \ tied to the\n   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object\
    \ type\n   is represented when being transmitted on the network.\n   The SMI specifies\
    \ the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],\n   subject to the additional\
    \ requirements imposed by the SNMP.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Format of Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Format of Definitions\n   Section 4 contains contains the specification\
    \ of all object types\n   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are\
    \ defined using the\n   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions\n\
    \   specified in [9,10].\n"

- title: 3.1.  Frame Relay Operational Model
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Frame Relay Operational Model\n   For the purposes of understanding this\
    \ document, Frame Relay is\n   viewed as a multi-access media, not as a group\
    \ of point-to-point\n   connections.  This model proposes that Frame Relay is\
    \ a single\n   interface to the network (physical connection) with many destinations\n\
    \   or neighbors (virtual connections).  This view enables a network\n   manager\
    \ the ability to group all virtual connections with their\n   corresponding physical\
    \ connection thereby allowing simpler\n   diagnostics and trouble shooting.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Textual Conventions
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Textual Conventions\n   Several new data types are introduced as a textual\
    \ convention in this\n   MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the\
    \ readability of\n   the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications\n\
    \   if appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of the\n   these\
    \ textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the\n   semantics\
    \ of any managed objects.  The use of these is merely an\n   artifact of the explanatory\
    \ method used.  Objects defined in terms of\n   one of these methods are always\
    \ encoded by means of the rules that\n   define the primitive type.  Hence, no\
    \ changes to the SMI or the SNMP\n   are necessary to accommodate these textual\
    \ conventions which are\n   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and\
    \ writers in pursuit\n   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous\
    \ MIB documents.\n   The new data types are Index and DLCI.  Index refers to the\
    \ range\n   1..ifNumber, and is used to establish the correspondence between\n\
    \   ifEntries and Frame Relay Interfaces.  DLCI refers to the range\n   0..DLCINumber,\
    \ and is used to refer to the valid Data Link Connection\n   Indices.  DLCINumber\
    \ is, by definition, the largest possible DLCI\n   value possible under the configured\
    \ Q.922 Address Format.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Structure of MIB
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Structure of MIB\n   The MIB is composed of three groups, one defining\
    \ the Data Link\n   Connection Management Interface (DLCMI), one describing the\
    \ Circuits,\n   and a third describing errors.\n   During normal operation, Frame\
    \ Relay virtual circuits will be added,\n   deleted and change availability. \
    \ The occurrence of such changes is\n   of interest to the network manager and\
    \ therefore, one trap is\n   defined, intended to be corollary to the SNMP \"\
    Link Up\" and \"Link\n   Down\" traps.\n"
