    \  to-User Information (UUI) from the ITU-T Digital Subscriber\n   Signalling
    System No. 1 (DSS1) User-user information element within\n   SIP are described
    in RFC 6567.  As networks move to SIP, it is\n   important that applications requiring
    this data can continue to\n   function in SIP networks as well as have the ability
    to interwork\n   with this ISDN service for end-to-end transparency.  This document\n
    \  defines a usage (a new package called the ISDN UUI package) of the\n   User-to-User
    header field to enable interworking with this ISDN\n   service.\n   This document
    covers interworking with both public ISDN and private\n   ISDN capabilities, so
    the potential interworking with QSIG will also\n   be addressed.\n   The package
    is identified by the new value \"isdn-uui\" of the\n   \"purpose\" header field
    parameter.\n"

  - "1.  Overview\n   This document describes a usage of the User-to-User header field\n
    \  defined in [RFC7433] to enable the transport of UUI in ISDN\n   interworking
    scenarios using SIP [RFC3261].  Specifically, this\n   document discusses the
    interworking of the following items, which are\n   call control related: ITU-T
    Recommendation Q.931 DSS1 User-user\n   information element [Q931], ITU-T Recommendation
    Q.957.1 DSS1 User-\n   to-User Signalling (UUS) supplementary service [Q957.1],
    and ITU-T\n   Recommendation Q.763 User-to-User information parameter [Q763] data\n
    \  in SIP.  Today, UUI is widely used in the Public Switched Telephone\n   Network
    (PSTN) in contact centers and call centers that are\n   transitioning away from
    ISDN to SIP.\n   This usage is not limited to scenarios where interworking will
    occur.\n   Rather it describes a usage where interworking is possible if\n   interworking
    is met.  That does not preclude its usage directly\n   between two SIP terminals.\n"

    '
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  The Service\n   ISDN defines a number of related services.  Firstly,
      there is a user\n   signalling bearer service that uses the information elements
      /\n   parameters in the signalling channel to carry the data and does not\n
      \  establish a related circuit-switched connection.  For DSS1, this is\n   specified
      in ITU-T Recommendation Q.931, Sections 3.3 and 7 of\n   [Q931].  Secondly,
      it defines a User-to-User Signalling (UUS)\n   supplementary service that uses
      the information elements / parameters\n   in the signalling channel to carry
      additional data but that is used\n   in conjunction with the establishment of
      a related circuit-switched\n   connection.  This reuses the same information
      elements / parameters\n   as the user signalling bearer service, with the addition
      of other\n   signalling information, and for DSS1 this is specified in ITU-T\n
      \  Recommendation Q.957.1 [Q957.1].\n   ISDN defines three variants of the UUS
      supplementary service as\n   follows:\n   UUS1:  User-to-User Information exchanged
      during the setup and\n      clearing phases of a call by transporting DSS1 User-user\n
      \     information elements within call control messages.  This in itself\n      has
      two subvariants, UUS1 implicit and UUS1 explicit.  In UUS1\n      implicit,
      it is the presence of the user signalling data itself\n      that constitutes
      the request for the service.  UUS1 explicit uses\n      additional supplementary
      service control information to control\n      the request and granting of the
      service, as in UUS2 and UUS3.  As\n      a result, UUS1 explicit also allows
      the requester to additionally\n      specify whether the parallel circuit-switched
      connection should\n      proceed if the UUS1 service cannot be provided (preferred
      or\n      required);\n   UUS2:  DSS1 User-user information elements exchanged
      from the\n      sender's point of view during call establishment, between the
      DSS1\n      ALERTING and DSS1 CONNECT messages, within DSS1 USER INFORMATION\n
      \     messages; and\n   UUS3:  DSS1 User-user information elements exchanged
      while a call is\n      in the Active state, within DSS1 USER INFORMATION messages.\n
      \  The service is always requested by the calling user.\n   This document defines
      only the provision of the ISDN UUS1 implicit\n   supplementary service to interworking
      scenarios, this being the most\n   widely deployed and used of the various ISDN
      User-to-User services,\n   and is indeed the one that matches the requirements
      specified in\n   [RFC6567].\n   The above comes from the ISDN specifications
      defined for public\n   networks.  There is a parallel set of ISDN specifications
      defined for\n   private networks (QSIG).  These specifications do not define
      a UUS1\n   implicit supplementary service.  However, implementation of such
      a\n   UUS1 implicit supplementary service for private networks can readily\n
      \  be constructed in a proprietary fashion based on the specifications\n   for
      public networks, and evidence suggests that some vendors have\n   done so.  On
      this basis, there is no reason why this package cannot\n   also be used to support
      interworking with such a private network\n   service, on the assumption that
      the constraints are exactly the same\n   as those for the public network.\n
      \  The ISDN UUS1 service has the following additional characteristics as\n   to
      the data that can be transported:\n      The maximum number of octets of user
      information that can be\n      transported is 128 octets plus a protocol discriminator.
      \ It is\n      noted that some early ISDN implementations had a limitation of
      32\n      octets, but it is understood that these are not currently\n      deployed.
      \ While this package does not prohibit longer data\n      fields, the mechanism
      at any interworking point discards data\n      elements that are too long to
      handle.  The handled length can\n      normally be assumed to be 128 octets.\n
      \     The content of the user information octets is described by a\n      single
      octet protocol discriminator (see Table 4-26 of ITU-T\n      Recommendation
      Q.931) [Q931].  That protocol discriminator may\n      describe the protocol
      used within the user data, the structure of\n      the user data, or leave it
      entirely open.  Note that not all\n      values within the protocol discriminator
      necessarily make sense\n      for use in the ISDN User-to-User service, as the
      content is\n      aligned with the protocol discriminator that appears at the
      start\n      of all DSS1 messages (see Table 4-1 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.931)\n
      \     [Q931].  The protocol discriminator value has no impact on the\n      interworking
      capability.\n      Only a single piece of UUI data can be transported in each\n
      \     message.\n      The ISDN service works without encryption or integrity
      protection.\n      The user trusts the intermediate network elements, and therefore\n
      \     the operator of those elements, not to modify the data and to\n      deliver
      all the data to the remote user.  On a link-by-link basis,\n      message contents
      are protected at Layer 2 by standard cyclic\n      redundancy check mechanisms
      -- this allows loss on a link-level\n      basis to be detected but does not
      guard against fraudulent attacks\n      on the link itself.  This does not prevent
      the use of additional\n      encryption or integrity protection within the UUI
      data itself,\n      although the limit on the size of the UUI data (protocol\n
      \     discriminator plus 128 octets) will restrict this.\n"
    title: 3.1.  The Service
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Impacts of the ISDN Service on SIP Operation\n   The ISDN service has
      the following impacts that need to be understood\n   within the SIP environment.\n
      \  Call transfer:  ISDN call transfer cancels all ISDN User-to-User\n      supplementary
      services.  In the ISDN, if User-to-User data is\n      required after call transfer,
      then UUS3 has to be renegotiated,\n      which is not provided by this SIP extension.
      \ The impact of this\n      restriction on the SIP environment is that UUI header
      fields\n      cannot be exchanged in transactions clearing down the SIP dialog\n
      \     after call transfer has occurred.\n   Conference:  ISDN conferencing allows
      the user to still exchange\n      User-to-User data after the conference is
      created.  As far as UUS1\n      is concerned, it is not permitted.  The ISDN
      three-party\n      supplementary service is similar in many ways to conferencing
      but\n      is signalled using a different mechanism.  This means that on\n      clearing,
      the controller using UUS1 implicit does have the choice\n      of sending data
      to either or both remote users.  Because SIP\n      conferencing cannot completely
      emulate the ISDN three-party\n      supplementary service at the served user,
      UUS1 implicit is not\n      possible.\n   Diversion:  When ISDN diversion occurs,
      any UUS1 User-to-User data is\n      sent to the forwarded-to-user (assuming
      that the call meets\n      requirements for providing the service -- this is
      impacted by the\n      explicit service only).  If the type of diversion is
      such that the\n      call is also delivered to the forwarding user, they will
      also\n      receive any UUS1 User-to-User data.\n"

  title: 3.  Summary of the ISDN User-to-User Service
- contents:
  - "4.  Relation to SIP-T\n   A method of transport of ISDN User-to-User data is
    to use SIP-T\n   [RFC3372] and transport the UUI information end-to-end (as part
    of an\n   ISUP message or QSIG message) as a MIME body.  If the SIP-T method of\n
    \  encapsulation of ISDN instead of interworking is used, this is a\n   reasonable
    mechanism and does not require any extensions to existing\n   SIP-T.  However,
    if true ISDN interworking is being done, and\n   therefore SIP-T would not otherwise
    be used, this approach is not\n   reasonable because then implementation of the
    many elements of the\n   ISUP syntax would be required to understand one element
    of data.\n   Instead, the better approach is to interwork the ISDN User-to-User\n
    \  data using the native SIP UUI transport mechanism, the User-to-User\n   header
    field.  The rest of this document describes this approach.\n"
  title: 4.  Relation to SIP-T
- contents:
  - "5.  Transition Away from ISDN\n   This interworking usage of the SIP UUI mechanism
    will likely begin\n   with one UA as an ISDN gateway while the other UA is a native
    SIP\n   endpoint.  As networks transition away from ISDN, it is possible that\n
    \  both UAs could become native SIP endpoints.  In this case, there is\n   an
    opportunity to transition away from this ISDN usage to a more\n   general usage
    of [RFC7433].\n   The SIP UUI mechanism provides a way to achieve this transition.
    \ As\n   an endpoint moves from being an ISDN gateway to a native SIP\n   endpoint,
    and a future package for some form of enhanced UUI has been\n   standardized,
    the endpoint can carry the UUI data both as ISDN and as\n   the future package
    in parallel and in the same messages or in\n   different messages depending on
    the needs of the application.  This\n   will permit the other endpoint to use
    the UUI according to the ISDN\n   UUI package if it is an ISDN gateway or according
    to the future\n   package if it is a native SIP endpoint.\n"
  title: 5.  Transition Away from ISDN
- contents:
  - "6.  ISDN Usage of the User-to-User Header Field\n   This document defines the
    package for the ISDN interworking of UUI\n   that interoperates with ISDN UUS,
    a supplementary service in which\n   the user is able to send/receive a limited
    amount of information to/\n   from another ISDN user over the signalling channel
    in association\n   with a call to the other ISDN user.\n   Two examples of ISDN
    UUI with redirection (transfer and diversion)\n   are defined in [ANSII] and [ETSI].\n
    \  One objective of the design of this package has been to keep the\n   functionality
    at the interworking point as simple as possible.  As a\n   result, there is also
    only one encoding value specified.\n   Responsibility for respecting the limits
    has been transferred to the\n   end UA.  If an interworking point is reached,
    and the limitations of\n   the ISDN (see Section 3.1) are not met, then the UUI
    data will not be\n   transferred, although the SIP request will otherwise be interworked.\n
    \  This is rather than have the interworking point attempt to resolve\n   the
    non-compliance with the limitations of ISDN.\n   The general principals of the
    UUI mechanism package are, therefore,\n   as follows:\n      The sending application
    is expected to limit their sending\n      requirements to the subset provided
    by the ISDN User-to-User\n      service.\n      The SIP UA will not allow the
    reception of more than one\n      User-to-User header field relating to the \"isdn-uui\"
    package in\n      the same SIP request or response; it will only allow it in a\n
    \     request or response of the appropriate method (INVITE or BYE).\n      What
    happens to User-to-User header fields relating to other\n      packages is outside
    the scope of this document.\n      An interworking point trying to interwork UUI
    data that is too\n      long will discard the UUI data but proceed with the interworking.\n
    \     There is no notification of such discard back to the sending user.\n      If
    the SIP user knows that it is interworking with the ISDN, then\n      the UUI
    application at the SIP endpoint should limit its\n      communication to packets
    of 128 octets plus the protocol\n      discriminator, with the knowledge that
    discard will occur if it\n      does not.  The UUI application at the SIP endpoint
    has complete\n      control over what occurs.  It should be noted that this was\n
    \     exactly the envisaged operation when early ISDN implementations\n      that
    only supported 32 octets interworked with those supporting\n      128 octets.
    \ It also corresponds to the interworking with ISDNs\n      that do not support
    the supplementary service at all, as discard\n      will occur in these circumstances
    as well.  Note that failure to\n      include the User-to-User data into the ISDN
    SETUP message (when\n      discard occurs) will result in the service being unavailable
    for\n      the remainder of the call when UUS1 implicit operation is used.\n"
  title: 6.  ISDN Usage of the User-to-User Header Field
- contents:
  - "7.  UAC Requirements\n   The User Agent Client (UAC) MUST meet the requirements
    of [RFC7433]\n   in addition to the requirements defined in this document.\n   The
    UAC MUST only use this UUI mechanism extension package in\n   association with
    the initial INVITE method and the BYE method\n   relating to an INVITE dialog.
    \ Usage on transactions associated with\n   any other type of dialog, or on methods
    not associated with a dialog,\n   is precluded.  Usage on other methods within
    the INVITE dialog, and\n   on re-INVITE transactions with the INVITE dialog, is
    also precluded.\n   If the UAC wishes to use or permit the sending of UUI data
    at any\n   point in the dialog, the UAC MUST include in the INVITE request for\n
    \  that dialog a User-to-User header field.  The UAC SHOULD set the\n   \"purpose\"
    header field parameter to \"isdn-uui\".  Non-inclusion of the\n   \"purpose\"
    header field parameter is permitted, but this is primarily\n   to allow earlier
    implementations to support this package.  This\n   initial header field constitutes
    the implicit request to use the UUI\n   service and is, therefore, included even
    when there is no data except\n   the protocol discriminator octet to send at that
    point in time.\n   The UAC MUST NOT include the User-to-User header field with
    a\n   \"purpose\" header field parameter set to \"isdn-uui\", or with no\n   \"purpose\"
    header field parameter, in any message of an INVITE dialog\n   if the original
    INVITE request did not include the User-to-User\n   header field, either with
    a \"purpose\" header field parameter set to\n   \"isdn-uui\" or with no \"purpose\"
    header field parameter included.\n   When sending UUI for the ISDN UUI package,
    if the \"purpose\" header\n   field is included, the UAC MUST set the User-to-User
    \"purpose\" header\n   field parameter to \"isdn-uui\".  The UAC MUST NOT include
    more than\n   one User-to-User header field for this package in any SIP request
    or\n   response.\n   When receiving UUI, when multiple User-to-User header fields
    are\n   received in the same response with the \"purpose\" header field\n   parameter
    set to \"isdn-uui\", or with no \"purpose\" header field\n   parameter, or with
    some combination of these, the UAC MUST discard\n   all these header fields.  There
    are no mechanisms for determining\n   which ones are the intended UUI data, so
    all are discarded.\n   The application designer will need to take into account
    the ISDN\n   service restrictions; failure to do so can result in information\n
    \  being discarded at any interworking point with the ISDN.  This\n   document
    makes no further normative requirements based on those\n   constraints because
    those constraints may vary from one ISDN to\n   another.  It is reasonable to
    expect that a limitation of 128 octets\n   (plus a protocol discriminator) can
    be imposed by the ISDN;\n   therefore, UUI data longer than this will never reach
    the destination\n   if such interworking occurs.  Note that the 128-octet limit
    (plus a\n   protocol discriminator) applies before the encoding (or after the\n
    \  decoding) using the \"hex\" encoding.  The \"hex\" encoding is defined in\n
    \  [RFC7433].\n   A \"uui\" option tag for use with the UUI mechanism extension
    is\n   defined in [RFC7433].  Because the service is UUS1 implicit for the\n   ISDN
    User-to-User service, the inclusion of the \"uui\" option tag in a\n   Supported
    header field conveys no additional information over and\n   above the presence,
    in the INVITE request, of the User-to-User header\n   field with the \"purpose\"
    header field parameter set to \"isdn-uui\".\n   While there is no harm in including
    the \"uui\" option tag, and\n   strictly it should be included if the extension
    is supported, it\n   performs no function.  The presence of the \"uui\" option
    tag in the\n   Require header field of an INVITE request will cause the request
    to\n   fail if it reaches a UAS or ISDN interworking gateway that does not\n   support
    this extension; such usage is allowed but will produce\n   results that are inconsistent
    with the mechanisms defined in the ISDN\n   UUS supplementary service.\n"

    parameter set to \"isdn-uui\", or with no\n   \"purpose\" header field parameter,
    in any message of an INVITE dialog\n   if the original INVITE request did not
    include the User-to-User\n   header field, either with a \"purpose\" header field
    parameter set to\n   \"isdn-uui\" or with no \"purpose\" header field parameter
    included.\n   The UAS MAY include the User-to-User header field in responses to
    the\n   initial INVITE request, or the BYE requests or responses for the\n   dialog,
    only where the original INVITE request included a\n   User-to-User header field
    with the \"purpose\" header field parameter\n   set to \"isdn-uui\" or where no
    \"purpose\" header field parameter was\n   included.  When sending UUI for the
    ISDN UUI package, the UAS SHOULD\n   set the User-to-User \"purpose\" header field
    parameter to \"isdn-uui\".\n   Non-inclusion of the \"purpose\" header field parameter
    is permitted,\n   but this is primarily to allow earlier implementations to support\n
    \  this package.\n   When sending UUI for the ISDN UUI package, if the \"purpose\"
    header\n   field is included, the UAS MUST set the User-to-User \"purpose\" header\n
    \  field parameter to \"isdn-uui\".  The UAS MUST NOT include more than\n   one
    User-to-User header field for this package in any SIP request or\n   response.\n
    \  The \"isdn-interwork\" value for the \"purpose\" header field parameter\n   was
    used in documents that led to the publication of the present\n   document.  Although
    these documents had no other status than \"Work in\n   Progress\", this value
    is implemented by some vendors.  While not\n   defined by this document, implementations
    could find it useful for\n   interoperability purposes to support parsing and
    interpreting\n   \"isdn-interwork\" the same way as \"isdn-uui\" when receiving
    messages.\n   Where the UAS is acting as a redirect server, the UAS MUST NOT\n
    \  include the User-to-User header field in the header URI parameter in\n   a
    3xx response to an incoming request.\n   When receiving UUI, when a User-to-User
    header field is received in a\n   request that is not from the originating user
    with the \"purpose\"\n   header field parameter set to \"isdn-uui\", or with no
    \"purpose\" header\n   field parameter, the UAS MUST discard this header field.\n
    \  When receiving UUI, when multiple User-to-User header fields are\n   received
    from the originating user in the same request with the\n   \"purpose\" header
    field parameter set to \"isdn-uui\", or with no\n   \"purpose\" header field parameter,
    or with some combination of these,\n   the UAS MUST discard all these header fields.
    \ There are no\n   mechanisms for determining which ones are the intended UUI
    data, so\n   all are discarded.\n"

    the appropriate package document for that value applies.\n   The default and only
    content defined for this package is \"isdn-uui\".\n   When sending UUI, the sending
    SIP entity MAY, but need not, include a\n   \"content\" header field with a value
    set to \"isdn-uui\".  A receiving\n   SIP entity MUST ignore a received User-to-User
    header field if the\n   \"content\" header field parameter is present and the

    field if the\n   \"encoding\" header field parameter is present and the value
    is some\n   other value than \"hex\".\n   When sending UUI, the sending application
    MUST include a protocol\n   discriminator octet, conforming to Table 4-26 of ITU-T
    Recommendation\n   Q.931 [Q931], as the first octet of the UUI data.  It is up
    to the\n   receiving application what it does with this value.  This document\n
    \  places no other normative requirement on the use of the protocol\n   discriminator;
    it is required at interworking gateways to allow\n   mapping into the appropriate
    fields in the ISDN protocols; otherwise,\n   the usage is entirely up to the application

  - "10.  Considerations for ISDN Interworking Gateways\n   ISDN interworking gateways
    MUST support the requirements defined for\n   UAS and UAC operation.\n   ISDN
    interworking gateways MUST support only the \"isdn-uui\" package\n   on dialogs
    that are interworked.\n   ISDN interworking gateways will take octet-structured
    data from the\n   ISDN side and encode it using the \"hex\" encoding scheme defined
    in\n   [RFC7433] for inclusion as the UUI data in the User-to-User header\n   field.
    \ In the reverse direction, it will take valid UUI data\n   according to the \"hex\"
    encoding scheme and decode it to octet-\n   structured data to send to the ISDN
    side.\n   When mapping data content from the ISDN to SIP signalling, or from\n
    \  SIP signalling to the ISDN, the gateway needs to assume that all\n   content
    is octet-structured binary, irrespective of the value of the\n   received protocol
    discriminator.  There are no requirements in the\n   ISDN to ensure that the content
    matches the value of the protocol\n   discriminator; the application usage sorts
    out any discrepancy.  The\n   same applies to the ISDN protocol discriminator
    as the first octet of\n   the UUI data, as defined in Table 4-26 of ITU-T Recommendation
    Q.931\n   [Q931]; the interworking gateway will not perform any additional\n   checking
    of this value.\n   A \"uui\" option tag for use with the UUI mechanism extension
    is\n   defined in [RFC7433].  The option tag is not interworked at an ISDN\n   interworking
    gateway.  The ISDN interworking gateways MUST NOT take\n   the omission of the
    \"uui\" option tag in a received INVITE request to\n   indicate that interworking
    of a received header field is not to be\n   performed.\n"

  title: 13.  IANA Considerations

  - "14.  Security Considerations\n   This document contains no specific requirements
    in regard to security\n   over and above those specified in [RFC7433].  However,
    since this\n   capability is designed to interwork with the ISDN, the general\n
    \  security considerations of SIP to ISDN User Part (ISUP) interworking\n   defined
    in [RFC3398] apply.  Any SIP/PSTN gateway implementing the\n   ISDN User-to-User
    service should not blindly trust ISUP from the\n   PSTN.  In general, the overlying
    use case will define the security\n   measures required.  The underlying User-to-User
    header field\n   extension provides a number of tools that can meet certain security\n
    \  requirements.\n   Information that might otherwise reveal private information
    about an\n   individual, or where a level of authenticity needs to be guaranteed,\n
    \  may need a higher level of protection and may indeed not be suitable\n   for
    this package, particularly taking into account the statement in\n   the following
    paragraph.\n   As this capability is defined to interwork with the ISDN, if the
    ISDN\n   forms part of the route, any usage needs to be aware that the\n   security
    level of the ISDN service may be lower than the security of\n   the SIP service.
    \ The ISDN security is itself not definable on an\n   end-to-end basis and exists
    on a hop-by-hop basis.  This can be high\n   in some places (e.g., it can require
    physical access to a secure\n   building) and in other places it can be low (e.g.,
    the point where an\n   ISDN access enters a building).  If this level of security
    is not\n   sufficient, then either a different package or indeed a different\n
    \  method of data transfer needs to be selected by the application user.\n"
