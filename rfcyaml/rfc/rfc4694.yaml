  - "1.  Introduction\n   Number portability (NP) [RFC3482] allows telephony subscribers
    to\n   keep their telephone numbers when they change service provider\n   (service
    provider portability), move to a new location (location\n   portability), or change
    the subscribed services (service\n   portability).  The telephone numbers can
    be the geographical\n   telephone numbers, mobile telephone numbers, freephone
    numbers, or\n   other types of non-geographical telephone numbers.  Some mobile\n
    \  telephone numbers are like geographical telephone numbers (e.g.,\n   those
    in North America) and others are of non-geographical nature but\n   their routing
    is similar to the routing of geographical telephone\n   numbers so they are not
    specifically mentioned in this document.  The\n   freephone numbers are also known
    as toll-free phone numbers.  The\n   called party who is assigned the freephone
    number pays the call\n   charge when the caller dials the freephone number.\n
    \  NP impacts call signaling and routing.  One impact is the need to\n   carry
    the NP-related information in the \"tel\" Uniform Resource\n   Identifier (URI)
    [RFC3966] for protocols such as the Session\n   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261]
    and H.323 [H323] after the NP\n   database dip has been performed.  Another impact
    is for a Voice over\n   IP (VoIP) server to use the NP-related information in
    a received\n   \"tel\" URI to determine routing.\n   A routing number is associated
    with a geographical or mobile\n   telephone number that has been ported out from
    a donor carrier to\n   another carrier.  A donor carrier is the initial carrier
    where a\n   geographical telephone number was allocated before ever being ported.\n
    \  A \"non-ported\" geographical or mobile telephone number does not have\n   any
    routing number associated with it because the first N digits of\n   the geographical
    or mobile telephone number can be used for routing.\n   A routing number can also
    be used to indicate the switch or network\n   node that originates a call or service
    similar to the Jurisdiction\n   Information Parameter in Signaling System Number
    7 (SS7) Integrated\n   Services Digital Network User Part (ISUP).  The \"rn\"
    parameter\n   carries the routing number information.  The \"rn-context\" parameter\n
    \  describes how the \"rn\" parameter value should be interpreted when the\n   value
    is not a \"global-rn\" as is discussed in Section 4.\n   The NP database dip indicator
    is used to inform the downstream\n   servers or switches during call setup that
    there is no need to\n   perform the NP database dip for a geographical telephone
    number\n   again.  The \"npdi\" parameter carries such an indicator.\n   A Carrier
    Identification Code (CIC) identifies the current freephone\n   service provider
    for a freephone number.  This parameter can also be\n   used to carry the pre-subscribed
    or dialed long-distance carrier\n   information; however, that is outside the
    scope of this document.\n   The \"cic\" parameter carries the CIC information.
    \ The \"cic-context\"\n   parameter describes how the \"cic\" parameter value
    should be\n   interpreted when the value is not a \"global-cic\" as is discussed
    in\n   Section 4.\n"

  - "5.  Normative Rules\n   There are two distinct uses for the \"tel\" URI.  In
    one use, the \"tel\"\n   URI appears in a piece of static content.  For example,
    it might\n   appear in a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page or a presence\n
    \  document.  In another use, the \"tel\" URI appears in call signaling\n   protocols,
    such as SIP and H.323, where it is used to guide routing\n   of the call setup
    messages.  The \"tel\" URI extensions defined in this\n   document are targeted
    at call signaling protocols.  When a \"tel\" URI\n   is placed in static content,
    the parameters defined here SHOULD NOT\n   be present, and any entity receiving
    them SHOULD remove them prior to\n   using the tel URI.\n   Within the context
    of signaling protocols, these parameters are meant\n   for usage between call
    signaling entities, called network nodes,\n   among which there is a trust relationship.
    \ Since parameters inserted\n   by one network node can impact the routing of
    a request at a\n   downstream node, processing of these parameters depends on
    trusting\n   that the upstream element properly followed the rules defined here.\n
    \  A call signaling protocol can verify that an upstream element is part\n   of
    its circle of trust through hop-by-hop integrity mechanisms.  See\n   Section
    7, Security Considerations, for more information.  If a\n   network node receives
    a call signaling message from an element it\n   does not trust, it SHOULD ignore
    the parameters.\n   This section discusses how a network node handles a received
    \"tel\"\n   URI that contains one or more of the parameters defined in this\n
    \  document or has accessed an NP database for a freephone number or\n   geographical
    telephone number and needs to add some of the parameters\n   defined in this document
    to a \"tel\" URI.\n   In countries where there is no freephone number portability
    or\n   geographical telephone number portability, the call routing can be\n   based
    on the leading digits of the freephone number or geographical\n   telephone number.
    \ This document does not describe those scenarios.\n   Please note that two accesses
    to the freephone databases are normally\n   done for routing a call to a freephone
    number.  The first one is done\n   by the originating network that queries a freephone
    database for the\n   CIC information so that the call can be routed to the serving\n
    \  freephone service provider of the called freephone number.  When the\n   call
    reaches the serving freephone provider, the second database\n   access is performed
    to map the freephone number to a geographical\n   telephone number and/or internal
    routing information.  This document\n   does not address the case where internal
    routing information is\n   returned.\n   The first freephone database contains
    the CIC information for all the\n   active freephone numbers, whereas the second
    one usually contains\n   mapping information only for those freephone numbers
    served by a\n   freephone service provider.  Because the originating carrier may\n
    \  provide freephone service, its freephone database would contain the\n   CIC
    information for all the active freephone numbers plus the mapping\n   information
    for those freephone numbers it serves.  This document\n   refers to the two database
    accesses as \"the first freephone database\n   access\" and \"the second freephone
    database access\".\n   When handling the \"rn\" and \"cic\" parameters and the
    phone numbers in\n   the \"tel\" URI for purposes such as database access and
    routing, the\n   visual separators in them are removed before using the information
    in\n   them.\n   When a network node handles a \"tel\" URI that contains invalid
    \"rn\" or\n   \"cic\" information, it may release the call or drop the invalid\n
    \  parameter and access the appropriate NP database or freephone\n   database
    to see whether it can retrieve a valid routing number for a\n   geographical telephone
    number or valid CIC for the freephone number.\n   When a \"tel\" URI is received
    from an untrusted source, a network node\n   MAY redo the NPDB query.\n   SIP
    [RFC3261] has mechanisms in place to detect routing loops due to\n   URI re-writing,
    and the new parameters added here work within these\n   established contexts.
    \ The \"npdi\" parameter in the URI that indicates\n   a NPDB query has already
    been done can also prevent routing loop.\n   Other protocols considering using
    these \"tel\" URI parameters SHOULD\n   ensure that they have mechanisms in place
    to detect loops when re-\n   writing the \"tel\" URI.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  Handling \"tel\" URI with NP Parameter or Parameters\n   If the \"tel\"
      URI contains the \"npdi\" parameter, the network node MUST\n   NOT retrieve
      the NP-related information for geographical telephone\n   numbers even if it
      is set to do so.\n   If the \"tel\" URI contains the \"cic\" parameter whose
      CIC value is\n   different from the one this network node is associated with,
      this\n   network node MUST NOT retrieve the NP-related information for the\n
      \  geographical telephone number or perform the first freephone database\n   access
      for the freephone number in the \"tel\" URI.\n   For the \"cic\" and \"rn\"
      parameters and either a freephone number or\n   geographical telephone number,
      the order of processing is to look for\n   the \"cic\" parameter first for call
      routing.  If the CIC information\n   is not useful or the \"cic\" parameter
      does not exist, then the next\n   step is to look for the \"rn\" parameter.
      \ If the information in the\n   \"rn\" parameter is not useful or the \"rn\"
      parameter does not exist,\n   then the freephone number or geographical telephone
      number is used.\n   If the network node does not know how to route based on
      the \"cic\" or\n   \"rn\" parameter, the local policies MUST decide whether
      to stop the\n   call processing or continue the call processing by ignoring
      the\n   invalid/unknown information.\n   When looking for the \"cic\" parameter
      and that parameter exists in the\n   \"tel\" URI:\n   - The network node MUST
      ignore the \"cic\" parameter if the CIC\n     identifies a carrier or service
      provider associated with that node\n     and look for the \"rn\" parameter for
      making the routing decision.\n     It MUST remove the \"cic\" parameter when
      it routes the call to the\n     next-hop network node that belongs to another
      carrier or service\n     provider.\n   - The network node MUST invoke special
      handling process if the \"cic\"\n     parameter contains a code that requires
      such a treatment.  For\n     example, a CIC value of \"0110\" in the response
      to a freephone DB\n     query in North America indicates \"local, translated
      geographical\n     telephone number provided\".  In this particular example,
      the \"cic\"\n     parameter is ignored.  Please note that this particular CIC
      value\n     of \"+1-0110\" normally will not appear in the call setup message.\n
      \    It is given as an example to show that such special CIC values may\n     exist.
      \ The exact code values and the handling of them are outside\n     the scope
      of this document.\n   - Otherwise, the network node MUST make the routing decision
      based on\n     the CIC.  The network node MUST NOT remove the \"cic\" parameter\n
      \    unless it is handing over the call to the carrier or service\n     provider
      identified by the CIC and the local policies require it to\n     remove the
      \"cic\" parameter.  How the call is actually routed based\n     on the CIC value
      in the \"cic\" parameter is outside the scope of\n     this document.\n   When
      looking for the \"rn\" parameter and that parameter exists in the\n   \"tel\"
      URI:\n   - If the routing number in the \"rn\" parameter points to this network\n
      \    node (e.g., the call has reached the intended network node), this\n     network
      node MUST look for the freephone number or geographical\n     telephone number
      for making the routing decision.  It MUST remove\n     the \"rn\" parameter
      when setting up the call to the next-hop network\n     node regardless if that
      next-hop network node is in the same or\n     different network.\n   - If the
      routing number in the \"rn\" parameter points to a network\n     this network
      node is in (e.g., in some countries the routing number\n     gets the call to
      the serving carrier network where another NP\n     database access is required
      to locate the serving switch), this\n     network node MUST look for the freephone
      number or geographical\n     telephone number for making the routing decision.
      \ The network node\n     MAY access the NP database for routing information
      if it is set to\n     do so.  It MUST remove the \"rn\" parameter if the next-hop
      network\n     node belongs to another carrier or service provider.\n   - Otherwise,
      the network node MUST make the routing decision based on\n     the routing number
      in the \"rn\" parameter.  How the call is actually\n     routed based on the
      routing number in the \"rn\" parameter is outside\n     the scope of this document.\n
      \  When the \"cic\" or \"rn\" parameter is not used for routing, the network\n
      \  node uses the freephone number or geographical telephone number for\n   making
      routing decisions.  It may access the NP database if it is set\n   to do so,
      or it may route the call to a designated network node that\n   will access the
      NP database, or it may route the call based on the\n   local routing table.
      \ How the call is handled at this stage is\n   outside the scope of this document.
      \ See Section 5.2 for rules in\n   adding the parameter or parameters defined
      in this document to the\n   \"tel\" URI if the network node is set to access
      the NP database.\n"

        a geographical telephone number is returned in the response,\n     it is possible
        that the NP-related information for that\n     geographical telephone number
        could also be returned.  In that\n     case, the network node MUST add the
        \"npdi\" parameter and MUST add\n     the \"rn\" parameter to contain the
        routing number in either the\n     \"global-rn\" or \"local-rn\" format only
        when the routing number is\n     available.\n   The network node MUST follow
        the rules described in Section 5.1 for\n   using the information in the \"tel\"
        URI to make the routing decision.\n"

      - "5.2.3.  Adding Location Information about the Caller\n   In SS7 ISUP, the
        JIP identifies the switch that originates the call,\n   and the information
        in it may be used by the serving carrier to\n   determine the call charge
        to the caller or by the involved carriers\n   to determine the settlement
        amount between them.\n   A network node that is the first to handle the call
        request from the\n   caller MAY include the \"rn\" parameter to the \"tel\"
        URI associated\n   with the caller, if one exists.  For example, if the network
        node is\n   a Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN) gateway that receives
        an\n   ISUP message that contains the JIP, the correct location information\n
        \  in the JIP can be placed in the \"rn\" parameter of the \"tel\" URI that\n
        \  is associated with the caller.\n   Please note that the information in
        the \"rn\" parameter may not be\n   authenticated; therefore, the use of the
        information by the recipient\n   of the \"tel\" URI for anything related to
        charging is done at its own\n   risk.\n"

    - contents:
      - "5.2.4.  Adding NP Parameter or Parameters Due to Protocol Conversion\n   A
        GSTN gateway needs to convert between SS7 ISUP and the VoIP\n   protocol such
        as SIP or H.323.  This type of network node MUST map\n   between the corresponding
        ISUP parameters and the parameters defined\n   in this document associated
        with the \"tel\" URI for routing and MAY\n   map between the corresponding
        ISUP parameters and the parameters\n   defined in this document that are in
        the \"tel\" URI associated with\n   the caller.\n   Since ISUP support for
        NP depends on the individual country, the\n   following discussion applies
        to a situation when a network node is to\n   map between the NP information
        in the American National Standards\n   Institute (ANSI) ISUP and the NP-related
        parameters in the \"tel\" URI.\n   For a ported geographical telephone number,
        the network node MUST\n   convert the routing number in the ISUP Called Party
        Number parameter\n   to a routing number in either the \"global-rn\" or \"local-rn\"
        format\n   and carry it in the \"rn\" parameter for a \"tel\" URI that is
        used for\n   routing.  The network node MUST convert the phone number that
        is\n   marked as the \"ported number\" in the ISUP Generic Address Parameter\n
        \  (GAP) to a phone number in either the \"global-number\" or \"local-\n   number\"
        format [RFC3966] and put it in the global-number-digits or\n   local-number-digits
        (see [RFC3966]) part of the \"tel\" URI that is\n   used for routing.\n   For
        a non-ported geographical telephone number, the network node MUST\n   convert
        the phone number in the ISUP Called Party Number parameter to\n   a phone
        number in either the \"global-number\" or \"local-number\" format\n   and
        put it in the global-number-digits or local-number-digits (see\n   [RFC3966])
        part of the \"tel\" URI that is used for routing.  The \"rn\"\n   parameter
        MUST NOT appear in the \"tel\" URI unless the local policies\n   require the
        network node to include it.  It is outside the scope of\n   this document
        how to include the \"rn\" parameter if the local policies\n   require the
        network node to do so.\n   The network node MUST include the \"npdi\" parameter
        in the \"tel\" URI\n   that is used for routing when the Ported Number Translation
        Indicator\n   (PNTI) bit in the Forward Call Indicator (FCI) parameter is
        set to\n   \"1\".\n   The network node MUST include the \"cic\" parameter
        in either the\n   \"global-cic\" or \"local-cic\" format in the \"tel\" URI
        that is used for\n   routing when the ISUP Carrier Identification Parameter
        (CIP) is\n   present.\n   The network node MAY include the \"rn\" parameter
        in the \"tel\" URI\n   associated with the caller information when the ISUP
        JIP is present.\n   This may be subject to the network node's local policy
        and/or the\n   signaling protocol that carries the \"tel\" URI.\n   Mapping
        NP-related parameters in a \"tel\" URI to the NP-related\n   information in
        the ISUP message depends on the national ISUP\n   implementation and is outside
        the scope of this document.\n"

    number\n      \"+1-800-123-4567\".  Assume that this freephone number is served
    by\n      a freephone service provider with a CIC \"+1-6789\".  After\n      retrieving
    the NP-related information, the \"tel\" URI would be set\n      to\n         tel:+1-800-123-4567;cic=+1-6789\n
    \  B. A \"tel\" URI, tel:+1-800-123-4567;cic=+1-6789, is handled by a\n      network
    node in the serving freephone service provider's network.\n      Assume that the
    freephone number is mapped to a geographical\n      telephone number \"+1-202-533-1234\".
    \ After retrieving the NP-\n      related information, the \"tel\" URI would be
    set to\n         tel:+1-202-533-1234\n   C. A \"tel\" URI, tel:+1-202-533-1234,
    contains a geographical\n      telephone number \"+1-202-533-1234\".  Assume that
    this geographical\n      telephone number is ported and is associated with a routing
    number\n      \"1-202-544-0000\".  After retrieving the NP-related information,\n
    \     the \"tel\" URI would be set to\n         tel:+1-202-533-1234;npdi;rn=+1-202-544-0000\n
    \  D. A \"tel\" URI, tel:+1-202-533-6789, contains a geographical\n      telephone
    number \"+1-202-533-6789\".  Assume that this geographical\n      telephone number
    is not ported.  After accessing the NP database,\n      the \"tel\" URI would
    be set to\n         tel:+1-202-533-6789;npdi\n   E. A \"tel\" URI, tel:+1-202-533-1234;npdi;rn=+1-202-000-0000,
    contains\n      an invalid routing number (e.g., no routing information on \"+1-\n
    \     202-000-0000\"); the network node may drop the \"rn\" parameter and\n      access
    the NP database again.\n   F. A \"tel\" URI, tel:+1-800-123-456, contains a freephone
    number\n      \"+1-800-123-456\" that is one digit short.  When accessing the\n
    \     freephone database, there will not be any \"cic\" information for\n      this
    freephone number.  The call would be released.\n   G. A \"tel\" URI, tel:+1-800-123-4567;cic=+1-56789,
    is handled by a\n      network node in an originating or a transit network.  The
    \"cic\"\n      information is invalid.  The network node may drop the \"cic\"\n
    \     parameter and access the freephone database again.  If the same\n      wrong
    CIC information is received, the network node would release\n      the call because
    it does not know how to route the call with an\n      invalid CIC.  If valid information
    is received, the network node\n      will use the received CIC in the \"cic\"
    and route the call based on\n      the \"cic\".\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   In addition to those security implications discussed
    in the revised\n   \"tel\" URI [RFC3966], there are new security implications
    associated\n   with the parameters defined in this document.\n   If the value
    of the \"rn\" or \"cic\" in the \"tel\" URI is changed\n   illegally when the
    signaling message carrying the \"tel\" URI is en\n   route to the destination
    entity, the signaling message or call may be\n   routed to the wrong network or
    network node causing the call setup to\n   be rejected.\n   If the \"npdi\" is
    illegally inserted into the \"tel\" URI when the\n   signaling message carrying
    the \"tel\" URI is en route to the\n   destination entity, the call may be routed
    to the wrong network or\n   network node causing the call setup to be rejected.
    \ It is less a\n   problem if the \"npdi\" is illegally removed.  An additional
    NPDB query\n   may be performed to retrieve the routing number information and
    have\n   the \"npdi\" included again.\n   If the \"rn\" in the \"tel\" URI that
    is associated with the caller is\n   illegally changed or inserted, the call charge
    based on that \"rn\"\n   would be incorrect.\n   Because of these considerations,
    these \"tel\" URI extensions are only\n   applicable within a set of network nodes
    among which there is mutual\n   trust.  If a node receives a call signaling request
    from an upstream\n   node that it does not trust, it SHOULD remove these parameters.
    \ This\n   will generally cause it to redo any DB queries.\n   To verify that
    an upstream neighbor is trusted, and to prevent man-\n   in-the-middle attacks
    whereby an attacker inserts or modifies these\n   parameters, call signaling protocols
    carrying these parameters SHOULD\n   provide hop-by-hop message integrity. In
    the case of SIP, this is\n   accomplished with the Session Initiation Protocol
    Secure (SIPS) URI\n   mechanism.\n"
