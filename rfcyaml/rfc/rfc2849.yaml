  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a file format suitable for describing\n
    \  directory information or modifications made to directory information.\n   The
    file format, known as LDIF, for LDAP Data Interchange Format, is\n   typically
    used to import and export directory information between\n   LDAP-based directory
    servers, or to describe a set of changes which\n   are to be applied to a directory.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "Background and Intended Usage\n   There are a number of situations where a common
    interchange format is\n   desirable.  For example, one might wish to export a
    copy of the\n   contents of a directory server to a file, move that file to a\n
    \  different machine, and import the contents into a second directory\n   server.\n
    \  Additionally, by using a well-defined interchange format, development\n   of
    data import tools from legacy systems is facilitated.  A fairly\n   simple set
    of tools written in awk or perl can, for example, convert\n   a database of personnel
    information into an LDIF file. This file can\n   then be imported into a directory
    server, regardless of the internal\n   database representation the target directory
    server uses.\n   The LDIF format was originally developed and used in the University\n
    \  of Michigan LDAP implementation.  The first use of LDIF was in\n   describing
    directory entries.  Later, the format was expanded to\n   allow representation
    of changes to directory entries.\n   Relationship to the application/directory
    MIME content-type:\n   The application/directory MIME content-type [1] is a general\n
    \  framework and format for conveying directory information, and is\n   independent
    of any particular directory service.  The LDIF format is\n   a simpler format
    which is perhaps easier to create, and may also be\n   used, as noted, to describe
    a set of changes to be applied to a\n   directory.\n   The key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"MAY\", \"SHOULD\", and \"SHOULD NOT\"\n   used in this document
    are to be interpreted as described in [7].\n"
  title: Background and Intended Usage
- contents:
  - "Definition of the LDAP Data Interchange Format\n   The LDIF format is used to
    convey directory information, or a\n   description of a set of changes made to
    directory entries.  An LDIF\n   file consists of a series of records separated
    by line separators.  A\n   record consists of a sequence of lines describing a
    directory entry,\n   or a sequence of lines describing a set of changes to a directory\n
    \  entry.  An LDIF file specifies a set of directory entries, or a set\n   of
    changes to be applied to directory entries, but not both.\n   There is a one-to-one
    correlation between LDAP operations that modify\n   the directory (add, delete,
    modify, and modrdn), and the types of\n   changerecords described below (\"add\",
    \"delete\", \"modify\", and\n   \"modrdn\" or \"moddn\").  This correspondence
    is intentional, and\n   permits a straightforward translation from LDIF changerecords
    to\n   protocol operations.\n"

    \ For the LDIF format described in this document, the version\n          number
    MUST be \"1\". If the version number is absent,\n          implementations MAY
    choose to interpret the contents as an\n          older LDIF file format, supported
    by the University of\n          Michigan ldap-3.3 implementation [8].\n      2)
    \ Any non-empty line, including comment lines, in an LDIF file\n          MAY
    be folded by inserting a line separator (SEP) and a SPACE.\n          Folding
    MUST NOT occur before the first character of the line.\n          In other words,
    folding a line into two lines, the first of\n          which is empty, is not
    permitted. Any line that begins with a\n          single space MUST be treated
    as a continuation of the previous\n          (non-empty) line. When joining folded
    lines, exactly one space\n          character at the beginning of each continued
    line must be\n          discarded. Implementations SHOULD NOT fold lines in the
    middle\n          of a multi-byte UTF-8 character.\n      3)  Any line that begins
    with a pound-sign (\"#\", ASCII 35) is a\n          comment line, and MUST be
    ignored when parsing an LDIF file.\n      4)  Any dn or rdn that contains characters
    other than those\n          defined as \"SAFE-UTF8-CHAR\", or begins with a character
    other\n          than those defined as \"SAFE-INIT-UTF8-CHAR\", above, MUST be\n
    \         base-64 encoded.  Other values MAY be base-64 encoded.  Any\n          value
    that contains characters other than those defined as\n          \"SAFE-CHAR\",
    or begins with a character other than those\n          defined as \"SAFE-INIT-CHAR\",
    above, MUST be base-64 encoded.\n          Other values MAY be base-64 encoded.\n
    \     5)  When a zero-length attribute value is to be included directly\n          in
    an LDIF file, it MUST be represented as\n          AttributeDescription \":\"
    FILL SEP.  For example, \"seeAlso:\"\n          followed by a newline represents
    a zero-length \"seeAlso\"\n          attribute value.  It is also permissible
    for the value\n          referred to by a URL to be of zero length.\n      6)
    When a URL is specified in an attrval-spec, the following\n          conventions
    apply:\n         a) Implementations SHOULD support the file:// URL format.  The\n
    \           contents of the referenced file are to be included verbatim\n            in
    the interpreted output of the LDIF file.\n         b) Implementations MAY support
    other URL formats.  The\n            semantics associated with each supported
    URL will be\n            documented in an associated Applicability Statement.\n
    \     7)  Distinguished names, relative distinguished names, and\n          attribute
    values of DirectoryString syntax MUST be valid UTF-8\n          strings.  Implementations
    that read LDIF MAY interpret files\n          in which these entities are stored
    in some other character set\n          encoding, but implementations MUST NOT
    generate LDIF content\n          which does not contain valid UTF-8 data.\n      8)
    \ Values or distinguished names that end with SPACE SHOULD be\n          base-64
    encoded.\n      9)  When controls are included in an LDIF file, implementations\n
    \         MAY choose to ignore some or all of them. This may be\n          necessary
    if the changes described in the LDIF file are being\n          sent on an LDAPv2
    connection (LDAPv2 does not support\n          controls), or the particular controls
    are not supported by the\n          remote server. If the criticality of a control
    is \"true\", then\n          the implementation MUST either include the control,
    or MUST\n          NOT send the operation to a remote server.\n      10) When
    an attrval-spec, distinguishedName, or rdn is base64-\n          encoded, the
    encoding rules specified in [5] are used with the\n          following exceptions:
    \ a) The requirement that base64 output\n          streams must be represented
    as lines of no more than 76\n          characters is removed. Lines in LDIF files
    may only be folded\n          according to the folding rules described in note
    2, above.  b)\n          Base64 strings in [5] may contain characters other than
    those\n          defined in BASE64-CHAR, and are ignored. LDIF does not permit\n
    \         any extraneous characters, other than those used for line\n          folding.\n"

  title: Examples of LDAP Data Interchange Format
- contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   Given typical directory applications, an LDIF file
    is likely to\n   contain sensitive personal data.  Appropriate measures should
    be\n   taken to protect the privacy of those persons whose data is contained\n
    \  in an LDIF file.\n   Since \":<\" directives can cause external content to
    be included when\n   processing an LDIF file, one should be cautious of accepting
    LDIF\n   files from external sources.  A \"trojan\" LDIF file could name a file\n
    \  with sensitive contents and cause it to be included in a directory\n   entry,
    which a hostile entity could read via LDAP.\n   LDIF does not provide any method
    for carrying authentication\n   information with an LDIF file.  Users of LDIF
    files must take care to\n   verify the integrity of an LDIF file received from
    an external\n   source.\n"

  - "Acknowledgments\n   The LDAP Interchange Format was developed as part of the
    University\n   of Michigan LDAP reference implementation, and was developed by
    Tim\n   Howes, Mark Smith, and Gordon Good.  It is based in part upon work\n   supported
    by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.  NCR-\n   9416667.\n   Members
    of the IETF LDAP Extensions Working group provided many\n   helpful suggestions.
    In particular, Hallvard B. Furuseth of the\n   University of Oslo made many significant
    contributions to this\n   document, including a thorough review and rewrite of
    the BNF.\n"
