- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Single Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM) meters an IP packet\
    \ stream\n   and marks its packets either green, yellow, or red.  Marking is based\n\
    \   on a Committed Information Rate (CIR) and two associated burst sizes,\n  \
    \ a Committed Burst Size (CBS) and an Excess Burst Size (EBS).  A\n   packet is\
    \ marked green if it doesn't exceed the CBS, yellow if it\n   does exceed the\
    \ CBS, but not the EBS, and red otherwise.  The srTCM\n   is useful, for example,\
    \ for ingress policing of a service, where only\n   the length, not the peak rate,\
    \ of the burst determines service\n   eligibility.\n   The Meter meters each packet\
    \ and passes the packet and the metering\n   result to the Marker:\n         \
    \            +------------+\n                     |   Result   |\n           \
    \          |            V\n                 +-------+    +--------+\n        \
    \         |       |    |        |\n      Packet Stream ===>| Meter |===>| Marker\
    \ |===> Marked Packet Stream\n                 |       |    |        |\n     \
    \            +-------+    +--------+\n   The Meter operates in one of two modes.\
    \  In the Color-Blind mode, the\n   Meter assumes that the packet stream is uncolored.\
    \  In the Color-\n   Aware mode the Meter assumes that some preceding entity has\
    \ pre-\n   colored the incoming packet stream so that each packet is either\n\
    \   green, yellow, or red.  The details of the pre-coloring process,\n   including\
    \ handling of error scenarios, and how the Meter determines\n   the color of a\
    \ pre-colored packet are DS domain specific and outside\n   the scope of this\
    \ document.\n   The Marker (re)colors an IP packet according to the results of\
    \ the\n   Meter.  The color is coded in the DS field [RFC2474] of the packet in\n\
    \   a PHB specific manner (see section 4 for an example).\n   A companion document\
    \ [RFC2698] describes another three color marker,\n   called a Two Rate Three\
    \ Color Maker (trTCM), where packets are marked\n   based on two rates and two\
    \ burst sizes.\n"
- title: 2. Configuration
  contents:
  - "2. Configuration\n   The srTCM is configured by setting its mode and by assigning\
    \ values\n   to three traffic parameters: a Committed Information Rate (CIR),\
    \ a\n   Committed Burst Size (CBS), and an Excess Burst Size (EBS).\n   The CIR\
    \ is measured in bytes of IP packets per second, i.e., it\n   includes the IP\
    \ header, but not link specific headers.\n   The CBS and the EBS and are measured\
    \ in bytes.  The CBS and EBS must\n   be configured so that at least one of them\
    \ is larger than 0.  It is\n   recommended that when the value of the CBS or the\
    \ EBS is larger than\n   0, it is larger than or equal to the size of the largest\
    \ possible IP\n   packet in the stream.\n"
- title: 3. Metering
  contents:
  - "3. Metering\n   The behavior of the Meter is specified in terms of its mode and\
    \ two\n   token buckets, C and E, which both share the common rate CIR.  The\n\
    \   maximum size of the token bucket C is CBS and the maximum size of the\n  \
    \ token bucket E is EBS.\n   The token buckets C and E are initially (at time\
    \ 0) full, i.e., the\n   token count Tc(0) = CBS and the token count Te(0) = EBS.\
    \  Thereafter,\n   the token counts Tc and Te are updated CIR times per second\
    \ as\n   follows:\n     o If Tc is less than CBS, Tc is incremented by one, else\n\
    \     o if Te is less then EBS, Te is incremented by one, else\n     o neither\
    \ Tc nor Te is incremented.\n   When a packet of size B bytes arrives at time\
    \ t, the following\n   happens if the srTCM is configured to operate in the Color-Blind\n\
    \   mode:\n     o If Tc(t)-B >= 0, the packet is green and Tc is decremented by\
    \ B\n       down to the minimum value of 0, else\n     o if Te(t)-B >= 0, the\
    \ packets is yellow and Te is decremented by B\n       down to the minimum value\
    \ of 0, else\n     o the packet is red and neither Tc nor Te is decremented.\n\
    \   When a packet of size B bytes arrives at time t, the following\n   happens\
    \ if the srTCM is configured to operate in the Color-Aware\n   mode:\n     o If\
    \ the packet has been precolored as green and Tc(t)-B >= 0, the\n       packet\
    \ is green and Tc is decremented by B down to the minimum\n       value of 0,\
    \ else\n     o If the packet has been precolored as green or yellow and if\n \
    \      Te(t)-B >= 0, the packets is yellow and Te is decremented by B\n      \
    \ down to the minimum value of 0, else\n     o the packet is red and neither Tc\
    \ nor Te is decremented.\n   Note that according to the above rules, marking of\
    \ a packet with a\n   given color requires that there be enough tokens of that\
    \ color to\n   accommodate the entire packet.  Other marking policies are clearly\n\
    \   possible. The above policy was chosen in order guarantee a\n   deterministic\
    \ behavior where the volume of green packets is never\n   smaller than what has\
    \ been determined by the CIR and CBS, i.e.,\n   tokens of a given color are always\
    \ spent on packets of that color.\n   The actual implementation of a Meter doesn't\
    \ need to be modeled\n   according to the above formal specification.\n"
- title: 4. Marking
  contents:
  - "4. Marking\n   The Marker reflects the metering result by setting the DS field\
    \ of\n   the packet to a particular codepoint.  In case of the AF PHB\n   [RFC2597],\
    \ the color can be coded as the drop precedence of the\n   packet.\n"
- title: 5. Service Example
  contents:
  - "5. Service Example\n   The srTCM can be used to mark a packet stream in a service,\
    \ where\n   different, decreasing levels of assurances (either absolute or\n \
    \  relative) are given to packets which are green, yellow, or red.  For\n   example,\
    \ a service may discard all red packets, because they exceeded\n   both the committed\
    \ and excess burst sizes, forward yellow packets as\n   best effort, and forward\
    \ green packets with a low drop probability.\n"
