  - "         November, 1974, Survey of New-Protocol TELNET Servers\n   Two months\
    \ have elapsed since our last survey, and the appearance of\n   additional New-Protocol\
    \ servers has progressed at the usual snail's\n   pace.  The changes in this list\
    \ are (with host numbers in octal):\n   SRI-AI (102) now has a New-Protocol server;\n\
    \   SDC-LAB (10) is back on the net and the list;\n   SDC-CC (110) is coming on\
    \ the net but status is as yet unknown;\n   USC-ISI (126) and USC-ISIB (226) (formerly\
    \ ISI-DEVTENEX) now have\n   New-Protocol servers;\n   SDAC-44 (32) has been removed\
    \ -- no longer classed as a server host;\n   HAWAII-500 (344) is coming on the\
    \ net, status presently unknown;\n   LONDON (52) has been added;\n   BBN-TENEXD\
    \ is now host 162 (formerly 205).\n   What follows is an update of the summary\
    \ and tabulation that appeared\n   in RFC #702.*  Is there light at the end of\
    \ the tunnel?\n         total server hosts             37      100%\n        \

    \ in this report were gathered via a surveying program run\n       at various\
    \ times, plus a few manual checks to fill out the data.\n       What is reported\
    \ here is the way the various servers work as seen\n       by the new-Protocol\
    \ User Telnet at BBNA, as of 4 Dec. 1974.\n   (2) These are the sites whose operation\
    \ is 100% correct according to\n       all protocols and conventions, as I understand\
    \ them.\n   (3) We realize that some of the servers that appear here as New-\n\
    \       Protocol servers on socket 1 are actually servers which attempt\n    \
    \   to communicate with both Old- and New-Protocol User TELNETs\n       according\
    \ to what control sequences are received.\n               Tabulation of server\
