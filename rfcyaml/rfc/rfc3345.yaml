  - "1. Introduction\n   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-Autonomous\
    \ System\n   routing protocol.  The primary function of a BGP speaking system\
    \ is\n   to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems.\n\
    \   In particular configurations, the BGP [1] scaling mechanisms defined\n   in\
    \ \"BGP Route Reflection - An Alternative to Full Mesh IBGP\" [2] and\n   \"Autonomous\
    \ System Confederations for BGP\" [3] will introduce\n   persistent BGP route\
    \ oscillation.\n   The problem is inherent in the way BGP works: locally defined\
    \ routing\n   policies may conflict globally, and certain types of conflicts can\n\
    \   cause persistent oscillation of the protocol.  Given current\n   practices,\
    \ we happen to see the problem manifest itself in the\n   context of MED + route\
    \ reflectors or confederations.\n   The current specification of BGP-4 [4] states\
    \ that the\n   MULTI_EXIT_DISC is only comparable between routes learned from\
    \ the\n   same neighboring AS.  This limitation is consistent with the\n   description\
    \ of the attribute: \"The MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute may be\n   used on external\
    \ (inter-AS) links to discriminate among multiple exit\n   or entry points to\
    \ the same neighboring AS.\" [1,4]\n   In a full mesh iBGP network, all the internal\
    \ routers have complete\n   visibility of the available exit points into a neighboring\
    \ AS.  The\n   comparison of the MULTI_EXIT_DISC for only some paths is not a\n\
    \   problem.\n   Because of the scalability implications of a full mesh iBGP network,\n\
    \   two alternatives have been standardized: route reflectors [2] and AS\n   confederations\
    \ [3].  Both alternatives describe methods by which\n   route distribution may\
    \ be achieved without a full iBGP mesh in an AS.\n   The route reflector alternative\
    \ defines the ability to re-advertise\n   (reflect) iBGP-learned routes to other\
    \ iBGP peers once the best path\n   is selected [2].  AS Confederations specify\
    \ the operation of a\n   collection of autonomous systems under a common administration\
    \ as a\n   single entity (i.e. from the outside, the internal topology and the\n\
    \   existence of separate autonomous systems are not visible).  In both\n   cases,\
    \ the reduction of the iBGP full mesh results in the fact that\n   not all the\
    \ BGP speakers in the AS have complete visibility of the\n   available exit points\
    \ into a neighboring AS.  In fact, the visibility\n   may be partial and inconsistent\
    \ depending on the location (and\n   function) of the router in the AS.\n   In\
    \ certain topologies involving either route reflectors or\n   confederations (detailed\
    \ description later in this document), the\n   partial visibility of the available\
    \ exit points into a neighboring AS\n   may result in an inconsistent best path\
    \ selection decision as the\n   routers don't have all the relevant information.\
    \  If the\n   inconsistencies span more than one peering router, they may result\
    \ in\n   a persistent route oscillation.  The best path selection rules\n   applied\
    \ in this document are consistent with the current\n   specification [4].\n  \
    \ The persistent route oscillation behavior is deterministic and can be\n   avoided\
    \ by employing some rudimentary BGP network design principles\n   until protocol\
    \ enhancements resolve the problem.\n   In the following sections a taxonomy of\
    \ the types of oscillations is\n   presented and a description of the set of conditions\
    \ that will\n   trigger route oscillations is given.  We continue by providing\n\
    \   several network design alternatives that remove the potential of this\n  \
    \ occurrence.\n   It is the intent of the authors that this document serve to\
    \ increase\n   operator awareness of the problem, as well as to trigger discussion\n\
    \   and subsequent proposals for potential protocol enhancements that\n   remove\
    \ the possibility of this to occur.\n   The oscillations are classified into Type\
    \ I and Type II depending\n   upon the criteria documented below.\n"
- title: 2. Discussion of Type I Churn
  contents:
  - "2. Discussion of Type I Churn\n   In the following two subsections we provide\
    \ configurations under\n   which Type I Churn will occur.  We begin with a discussion\
    \ of the\n   problem when using Route Reflection, and then discuss the problem\
    \ as\n   it relates to AS Confederations.\n   In general, Type I Churn occurs\
    \ only when BOTH of the following\n   conditions are met:\n      1) a single-level\
    \ Route Reflection or AS Confederations design is\n         used in the network\
    \ AND\n      2) the network accepts the BGP MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) attribute\n\
    \         from two or more ASs for a single prefix and the MED values are\n  \
    \       unique.\n   It is also possible for the non-deterministic ordering of\
    \ paths to\n   cause the route oscillation problem.  [1] does not specify that\
    \ paths\n   should be ordered based on MEDs but it has been proven that non-\n\
    \   deterministic ordering can lead to loops and inconsistent routing\n   decisions.\
    \  Most vendors have either implemented deterministic\n   ordering as default\
    \ behavior, or provide a knob that permits the\n   operator to configure the router\
    \ to order paths in a deterministic\n   manner based on MEDs.\n"

    \ as best, though this is\n         not the cause of the persistent route oscillation.\
    \  Ra realizes\n         it has the wrong route marked as best since the '6 100'\

    \ best because of the IGP\n         metric.  Rd sends an UPDATE/withdraw to its\
    \ peers letting them\n         know this is the best route.\n      5) Ra receives\

    \ for '6 100, 0, 13', which\n         changes what is considered the best route\
    \ for Ra.  This is why\n         Ra has the '10 100, 10, 5' route selected as\
    \ best in Step 1,\n         even though '6 100, 1, 4' is actually better.\n  \
    \    At this point, we've made a full loop and are back at Step 1.  The\n    \
    \  router realizes it is using the incorrect best path, and repeats\n      the\
    \ cycle.  This is an example of Type I Churn when using Route\n      Reflection.\n"

    \ what\n         is considered the best route for Ra.  Ra does not compute the\n\
    \         best path for a prefix unless its best route was withdrawn.\n      \
    \   This is why Ra has the '10 100, 10, 3' route selected as best,\n         even\
    \ though the '6 100, 1, 2' route is better.\n      4) Ra's periodic BGP scanner\
    \ runs and realizes that the '6 100'\n         route is better because of the\

  - "2.3. Potential Workarounds for Type I Churn\n   There are a number of alternatives\
    \ that can be employed to avoid this\n   problem:\n      1) When using Route Reflection\
    \ make sure that the inter-Cluster\n         links have a higher IGP metric than\
    \ the intra-Cluster links.\n         This is the preferred choice when using Route\
    \ Reflection.  Had\n         the inter-Cluster IGP metrics been much larger than\
    \ the intra-\n         Cluster IGP metrics, the above would not have occurred.\n\
    \      2) When using AS Confederations ensure that the inter-Sub-AS links\n  \
    \       have a higher IGP metric than the intra-Sub-AS links.  This is\n     \
    \    the preferred option when using AS Confederations.  Had the\n         inter-Sub-AS\
    \ IGP metrics been much larger than the intra-Sub-AS\n         IGP metrics, the\
    \ above would not have occurred.\n      3) Do not accept MEDs from peers (this\
    \ may not be a feasible\n         alternative).\n      4) Utilize other BGP attributes\
    \ higher in the decision process so\n         that the BGP decision algorithm\
    \ never reaches the MED step.  As\n         using this completely overrides MEDs,\
    \ Option 3 may make more\n         sense.\n      5) Always compare BGP MEDs, regardless\
    \ of whether or not they were\n         obtained from a single AS.  This is probably\
    \ a bad idea since\n         MEDs may be derived in a number of ways, and are\
    \ typically done\n         so as a matter of operator-specific policy.  As such,\
    \ comparing\n         MED values for a single prefix learned from multiple ASs\
    \ is\n         ill-advised.  Of course, this mostly defeats the purpose of\n \
    \        MEDs, and as such, Option 3 may be a more viable alternative.\n     \
    \ 6) Use a full IBGP mesh.  This is not a feasible solution for ASs\n        \
    \ with a large number of BGP speakers.\n"

    \ Reflection or Sub-ASs is used in\n         the network AND\n      2) the network\

  - "3.2. Potential Workarounds for Type II Churn\n   1) Do not accept MEDs from peers\
    \ (this may not be a feasible\n      alternative).\n   2) Utilize other BGP attributes\
    \ higher in the decision process so\n      that the BGP decision algorithm selects\
    \ a single AS before it\n      reaches the MED step.  For example, if local-pref\
    \ were set based\n      on the advertising AS, then you first eliminate all routes\
    \ except\n      those in a single AS.  In the example, router Re would pick either\n\
    \      X or Y based on your local-pref and never change selections.\n      This\
    \ leaves two simple workarounds for the two types of problems.\n      Type I:\
    \  Make inter-cluster or inter-sub-AS link metrics higher\n      than intra-cluster\
    \ or intra-sub-AS metrics.\n      Type II: Make route selections based on local-pref\
    \ assigned to the\n      advertising AS first and then use IGP cost and MED to\
    \ make\n      selection among routes from the same AS.\n      Note that this requires\
    \ per-prefix policies, as well as near\n      intimate knowledge of other networks\
    \ by the network operator.  The\n      authors are not aware of ANY [large] provider\
    \ today that performs\n      per-prefix policies on routes learned from peers.\
    \  Implicitly\n      removing this dynamic portion of route selection does not\
    \ appear\n      to be a viable option in today's networks.  The main point is\
    \ that\n      an available workaround using local-pref so that no two AS's\n \
    \     advertise a given prefix at the same local-pref solves type II\n      churn.\n\
    \   3) Always compare BGP MEDs, regardless of whether or not they were\n     \
    \ obtained from a single AS.  This is probably a bad idea since MEDs\n      may\
    \ be derived in a number of ways, and are typically done so as a\n      matter\
    \ of operator-specific policy and largely a function of\n      available metric\
    \ space provided by the employed IGP.  As such,\n      comparing MED values for\
    \ a single prefix learned from multiple ASs\n      is ill-advised.  This mostly\
    \ defeats the purpose of MEDs; Option 1\n      may be a more viable alternative.\n\
    \   4) Do not use more than one tier of Route Reflection or Sub-ASs in\n     \
    \ the network.   The risk of route oscillation should be considered\n      when\
    \ designing networks that might use a multi-tiered routing\n      isolation architecture.\n\
    \   5) In a RR topology, mesh the clients.  For confederations, mesh the\n   \
    \   border routers at each level in the hierarchy.  In Figure 3, for\n      example,\
    \ if Rb and Re are peers, then there's no churn.\n"

    \ problem\n   must be pursued.  Imposing network design requirements, such as\
    \ those\n   outlined above, are clearly an unreasonable long-term solution.\n\
    \   Problems such as this should not occur under 'default' protocol\n   configurations.\n"
