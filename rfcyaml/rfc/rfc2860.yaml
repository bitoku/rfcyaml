  - "MoU text as signed\n   MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING THE TECHNICAL WORK\
    \ OF THE\n   INTERNET ASSIGNED NUMBERS AUTHORITY\n   1. This Memorandum of Understanding\
    \ (\"MOU\") defines an agreement\n   between the Internet Engineering Task Force\
    \ and the Internet\n   Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Its intent\
    \ is exclusively\n   to define the technical work to be carried out by the Internet\n\
    \   Assigned Numbers Authority on behalf of the Internet Engineering Task\n  \
    \ Force and the Internet Research Task Force.  It is recognized that\n   ICANN\
    \ may, through the IANA, provide similar services to other\n   organisations with\
    \ respect to protocols not within IETF's scope (i.e.\n   registries not created\
    \ by IETF or IRTF action); nothing in this MOU\n   limits ICANN's ability to do\
    \ so.\n   2. This MOU will remain in effect until either modified or cancelled\n\
    \   by mutual consent of the Internet Engineering Task Force and the\n   Internet\
    \ Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or cancelled by\n   either party\
    \ with at least six (6) months notice.\n   3. Definition of terms and abbreviations\
    \ used in this document.\n   ICANN - Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and\
    \ Numbers, a\n   California non-profit corporation.\n   IANA - Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers Authority (a traditional name, used\n   here to refer to the technical\
    \ team making and publishing the\n   assignments of Internet protocol technical\
    \ parameters). The IANA\n   technical team is now part of ICANN.\n   IETF - the\
    \ Internet Engineering Task Force, the unincorporated\n   association operating\
    \ under such name that creates Internet Standards\n   and related documents.\n\
    \   IAB -  the Internet Architecture Board, an oversight committee of the\n  \
    \ IETF. The IAB is chartered to designate the IANA on behalf of the\n   IETF.\n\
    \   IESG - the Internet Engineering Steering Group, a management\n   committee\
    \ of the IETF.\n   IRTF - the Internet Research Task Force, an unincorporated\n\
    \   association also overseen by the IAB.\n   IRSG - the Internet Research Steering\
    \ group, a management committee\n   of the IRTF.\n   RFC -  \"Request For Comments\"\
    , the archival document series of the\n   IETF, also used by the IRTF and by third\
    \ parties.\n   ISOC - the Internet Society, a not-for-profit corporation that\n\
    \   supports the IETF.\n   4. Agreed technical work items.  ICANN agrees that\
    \ during the term of\n   this MOU it shall cause IANA to comply,  for protocols\
    \ within IETF's\n   scope, with the following requirements, which ICANN and IETF\n\
    \   acknowledge reflect the existing arrangements under which the IANA is\n  \
    \ operated:\n   4.1. The IANA will assign and register Internet protocol parameters\n\
    \   only as directed by the criteria and procedures specified in RFCs,\n   including\
    \ Proposed, Draft and full Internet Standards and Best\n   Current Practice documents,\
    \ and any other RFC that calls for IANA\n   assignment. If they are not so specified,\
    \ or in case of ambiguity,\n   IANA will continue to assign and register Internet\
    \ protocol\n   parameters that have traditionally been registered by IANA, following\n\
    \   past and current practice for such assignments, unless otherwise\n   directed\
    \ by the IESG.\n   If in doubt or in case of a technical dispute, IANA will seek\
    \ and\n   follow technical guidance exclusively from the IESG. Where\n   appropriate\
    \ the IESG will appoint an expert to advise IANA.\n   The IANA will work with\
    \ the IETF to develop any missing criteria and\n   procedures over time, which\
    \ the IANA will adopt when so instructed by\n   the IESG.\n   4.2. In the event\
    \ of technical dispute between the IANA and the IESG,\n   both will seek guidance\
    \ from the IAB whose decision shall be final.\n   4.3. Two particular assigned\
    \ spaces present policy issues in addition\n   to the technical considerations\
    \ specified by the IETF: the assignment\n   of domain names, and the assignment\
    \ of IP address blocks. These\n   policy issues are outside the scope of this\
    \ MOU.\n   Note that (a) assignments of domain names for technical uses (such\
    \ as\n   domain names for inverse DNS lookup), (b) assignments of specialised\n\
    \   address blocks (such as multicast or anycast blocks), and (c)\n   experimental\
    \ assignments are not considered to be policy issues, and\n   shall remain subject\
    \ to the provisions of this Section 4.  (For\n   purposes of this MOU, the term\
    \ \"assignments\" includes allocations.)\n   In the event ICANN adopts a policy\
    \ that prevents it from complying\n   with the provisions of this Section 4 with\
    \ respect to the assignments\n   described in (a) - (c) above, ICANN will notify\
    \ the IETF, which may\n   then exercise its ability to cancel this MOU under Section\
    \ 2 above.\n   4.4. The IANA shall make available to the public, on-line and free\
    \ of\n   charge, information about each current assignment, including contact\n\
    \   details for the assignee.  Assignments published in RFCs by the RFC\n   Editor\
    \ and available publicly will be deemed to meet the requirements\n   of this Section\
    \ 4.4.\n   4.5. The IANA shall provide on-line facilities for the public to\n\
    \   request Internet protocol parameter assignments and shall either\n   execute\
    \ such assignments, or deny them for non- conformance with\n   applicable technical\
    \ requirements, in a timely manner. There shall be\n   no charge for assignments\
    \ without the consent of the IAB. Requests\n   shall only be denied on legitimate\
    \ technical grounds.\n   For protocols within the IETF scope (i.e., registries\
    \ created by IETF\n   action), appeals against such denials may be made to the\
    \ IESG and\n   subsequently to the IAB as provided in 4.2 above.\n   4.6. The\
    \ IANA shall have non-voting liaison seats on appropriate IETF\n   committees\
    \ as determined by the IETF, and may participate in all IETF\n   discussions concerning\
    \ technical requirements for protocol parameter\n   assignment through such liaisons.\n\
    \   4.7. The IANA shall review all documents in IETF Last Call to\n   identify\
    \ any issues of concern to the IANA, and shall raise these\n   issues with the\
    \ IESG.\n   5.  Application to IRTF/IRSG.  The parties understand that certain\
    \ of\n   the protocol parameters to be assigned by IANA will be relevant to\n\
    \   IRTF, rather than IETF. With respect to these protocol parameters,\n   IANA\
    \ will comply with the procedures set forth in Section 4, with the\n   understanding\
    \ that IRTF and IRSG shall be substituted for IETF and\n   IESG, respectively,\
    \ in such procedures. In the event of any question\n   as to whether a particular\
    \ protocol parameter relates principally to\n   IETF or IRTF, the IAB shall have\
    \ the authority to answer such\n   question in its discretion.\n   6.  General.\
    \  This MOU does not constitute any of the parties as a\n   partner, joint venturer,\
    \ agent, principal or franchisee of any other\n   party. The waiver of any provision\
    \ of this MOU on any occasion shall\n   not constitute a waiver for purposes of\
    \ any other occasion.  No party\n   may transfer or assign any interest, right\
    \ or obligation arising\n   under this MOU without the prior written consent of\
    \ each other party\n   to this MOU.\n   7.  Effectiveness of MOU.  This Agreement\
    \ requires the approval or\n   ratification of the ICANN Board of Directors. \
    \ The signatory for\n   ICANN shall use his best efforts to secure and deliver\
    \ to IETF such\n   approval or ratification within two months of signing.\n  \
    \ IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Memorandum of Understanding is executed as\n   of this\
    \ first day of March 2000 by the undersigned, acting through\n   their duly authorized\
    \ representatives:\n   INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE\n   By: __________________________\
    \ Fred Baker, IETF Chair\n   Approved by:\n   INTERNET ARCHITECTURE BOARD\n  \
    \ By: __________________________ Brian Carpenter, IAB Chair\n   INTERNET CORPORATION\
    \ FOR ASSIGNED NAMES AND NUMBERS\n   By:___________________________ Mike Roberts,\
