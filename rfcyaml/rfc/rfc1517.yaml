- title: 1.   Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.   Introduction\n   As the Internet has evolved and grown in recent years,\
    \ it has become\n   clear that it will soon face several serious scaling problems.\
    \ These\n   include:\n      - Exhaustion of the class-B network address space.\
    \ One\n        fundamental cause of this problem is the lack of a network\n  \
    \      class of a size that is appropriate for a mid-sized\n        organization.\
    \ Class-C, with a maximum of 254 host addresses, is\n        too small, while\
    \ class-B, which allows up to 65534 addresses,\n        is too large to be densely\
    \ populated.  The result is inefficient\n        utilization of class-B network\
    \ numbers.\n      - Routing information overload. The size and rate of growth\
    \ of the\n        routing tables in Internet routers is beyond the ability of\n\
    \        current software (and people) to effectively manage.\n      - Eventual\
    \ exhaustion of IP network numbers.\n   It has become clear that the first two\
    \ of these problems are likely\n   to become critical in the near term.  Classless\
    \ Inter-Domain Routing\n   (CIDR) ttempts to deal with these problems by defining\
    \ a mechanism to\n   slow the growth of routing tables and reduce the need to\
    \ allocate new\n   IP network numbers.  It does not attempt to solve the third\
    \ problem,\n   which is of a more long-term nature, but instead endeavors to ease\n\
    \   enough of the short to mid-term difficulties to allow the Internet to\n  \
    \ continue to function efficiently while progress is made on a longer-\n   term\
    \ solution.\n   The IESG, after a thorough discussion in the IETF, in June 1992\n\
    \   selected CIDR as the solution for the short term routing table\n   explosion\
    \ problem [1].\n"
- title: 2. Components of the Architecture
  contents:
  - "2. Components of the Architecture\n   The CIDR architecture is described in the\
    \ following documents:\n      - \"An Architecture for IP Address Allocation with\
    \ CIDR\" [2]\n      - \"Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR):  An Address Assignment\n\
    \        and Aggregation Strategy\" [3]\n   The first of these documents presents\
    \ the overall architecture of\n   CIDR; the second describes the specific address\
    \ allocation scheme to\n   be used.\n   In addition to these two documents, \"\
    Guidelines for Management of IP\n   Address Space\" [4] provides specific recommendations\
    \ for assigning IP\n   addresses that are consistent with [2] and [3], and \"\
    Status of CIDR\n   Deployment in the Internet\" [5] describes the timetable for\
    \ deploying\n   [4] in the Internet.  Both [4] and [5] should be viewed as\n \
    \  supporting, rather than defining, documents.\n   In addition to the documents\
    \ mentioned above, CIDR requires that\n   inter-domain routing protocols be capable\
    \ of handling reachability\n   information that is expressed solely in terms of\
    \ IP address prefixes.\n   While several inter-domain routing protocols are capable\
    \ of\n   supporting such functionality, this Applicability Statement does not\n\
    \   mandate the use of a particular one.\n   Although Internet routing domains\
    \ are not required to use routing\n   protocols capable of propagating CIDR routes,\
    \ the topology such\n   routing domains can support will be somewhat limited.\
    \  In particular,\n   the non-CIDR-capable parts of the Internet will need to\
    \ default\n   towards the CIDR-capable parts of the Internet for routes which\
    \ have\n   been aggregated to non-network boundaries.\n"
- title: 3. Applicability of CIDR
  contents:
  - "3. Applicability of CIDR\n   The CIDR architecture is applicable to any group\
    \ of connected domains\n   that supports IP version 4 [6] [7].  CIDR does not\
    \ require all of the\n   domains in the Internet to be converted to use CIDR.\
    \ It assumes that\n   some of the existing domains in the Internet will never\
    \ be able to\n   convert.  Despite this, CIDR will still provide connectivity\
    \ to such\n   places, although the optimality of routes to these places may be\n\
    \   impacted.\n   This Applicability Statement requires Internet domains providing\n\
    \   backbone and/or transit service to fully implement CIDR in order to\n   ensure\
    \ that the growth of the resources required by routers to\n   provide Internet-wide\
    \ connectivity will be significantly slower than\n   the growth of the number\
    \ of assigned networks.\n   This Applicability Statement strongly recommends that\
    \ all non-\n   backbone/transit Internet domains also implement CIDR because it\
    \ will\n   reduce the amount of routing information inside of these domains.\n\
    \   Individual domains are free to choose whatever inter-domain and\n   intra-domain\
    \ routing architectures best meet their requirements.\n   Specifically, this Applicability\
    \ Statement does not prevent a domain\n   or a group of domains from using addressing\
    \ schemes which do not\n   conform to CIDR.  Subject to the available resources\
    \ in routers, CIDR\n   should be able to co-exist with other addressing schemes\
    \ without\n   adversely impacting overall connectivity.\n"
