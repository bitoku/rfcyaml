  - "         February, 1975, Survey of New-Protocol TELNET Servers\n   It has been\
    \ two and a half months since our last survey, and it has\n   been depressing\
    \ to note that \"progress\" toward an all-new-protocol\n   network has been even\
    \ slower than previously.  Changes since the last\n   list (with host numbers\
    \ in octal):\n   SRI-ARC (2) and OFFICE-1 (53) have added logger sockets 27, but\
    \ with\n      Old-Protocol servers (are these forerunners of New-Protocol\n  \
    \    servers?);\n   SDC-CC (110) has been removed from the list until it starts\
    \ operating\n      on the network\n   LL-67 (12) now has a New-Protocol server\
    \ on socket 1;\n   CASE-10 (15) has departed from the network;\n   BBN-TENEX is\
    \ now host 361 (formerly 105);\n   ANL (ARGONNE, 67) has come on the net with\
    \ Old- and New-Protocol\n      servers on sockets 1 and 27, respectively.\n  \
    \ The following is the latest version* of the summary and tabulation of\n   server-host\
    \ Telnet servers.\n           total server hosts             36      100%\n  \

    \ in this report were gathered via a surveying program run\n     at various times,\
    \ plus a few manual checks to fill out the data.\n     What is reported here is\
    \ the way the various servers work as seen\n     by the new-Protocol User Telnet\
    \ at BBNA, as of 20 Feb. 1975.\n   (2) These are the sites whose operation is\
    \ 100% correct according to\n       all protocols and conventions, as I understand\
    \ them.\n   (3) We realize that some of the servers that appear here as New-\n\
    \       Protocol servers on socket 1 are actually servers which attempt\n    \
    \   to communicate with both Old- and New-Protocol User TELNETs\n       according\
    \ to what control sequences are received.\n             Tabulation of server status\
