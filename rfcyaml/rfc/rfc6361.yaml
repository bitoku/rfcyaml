  - "1.  Introduction\n   The TRILL Protocol [RFC6325] defines a set of mechanisms
    used to\n   communicate between RBridges.  These devices can bridge together\n
    \  large 802 networks using link-state protocols in place of the\n   traditional
    spanning tree mechanisms [RFC5556].\n   Over Ethernet, TRILL uses two separate
    Ethertypes to distinguish\n   between encapsulation headers, which carry user
    data, and link-state\n   messages, which compute network topology using a protocol
    based on\n   [IS-IS] [RFC6326].  These two protocols must be distinguished from\n
    \  one another, and segregated from all other traffic.\n   In a network where
    PPP [RFC1661] is used to interconnect routers\n   (often over telecommunications
    links), it may be advantageous to be\n   able to bridge between Ethernet segments
    over those PPP links, and\n   thus integrate remote networks with an existing
    TRILL cloud.  The\n   existing Bridging Control Protocol (BCP) [RFC3518] allows
    direct\n   bridging of Ethernet frames over PPP.  However, this mechanism is\n
    \  inefficient and inadequate for TRILL, which can be optimized for use\n   over
    PPP links.\n   To interconnect these devices over PPP links, three protocol numbers\n
    \  are needed, and are reserved as follows:\n      Value (in hex)  Protocol Name\n
    \     --------------  -------------------------------------\n       005d           TRILL
    Network Protocol (TNP)\n       405d           TRILL Link State Protocol (TLSP)\n
    \      805d           TRILL Network Control Protocol (TNCP)\n   The usage of these
    three protocols is described in detail in the\n   following section.\n   The key
    words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document
    are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"

  - "2.  PPP TRILL Negotiation\n   The TRILL Network Control Protocol (TNCP) is responsible
    for\n   negotiating the use of the TRILL Network Protocol (TNP) and TRILL\n   Link
    State Protocol (TLSP) on a PPP link.  TNCP uses the same option\n   negotiation
    mechanism and state machine as described for LCP\n   (Section 4 of [RFC1661]).\n
    \  TNCP packets MUST NOT be exchanged until PPP has reached the Network-\n   Layer
    Protocol phase.  Any TNCP packets received when not in that\n   phase MUST be
    silently ignored.\n   The encapsulated network layer data, carried in TNP packets,
    and\n   topology information, carried in TLSP packets, MUST NOT be sent\n   unless
    TNCP is in the Opened state.  If a TNP or TLSP packet is\n   received when TNCP
    is not in the Opened state and LCP is in the\n   Opened state, an implementation
    MUST silently discard the unexpected\n   TNP or TLSP packet.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  TNCP Packet Format\n   Exactly one TNCP packet is carried in the PPP
      Information field, with\n   the PPP Protocol field set to hex 805d (TNCP).  A
      summary of the TNCP\n   packet format is shown below.  The fields are transmitted
      from left\n   to right.\n       0                   1                   2                   3\n

      through 7 (Configure-Request,\n      Configure-Ack, Configure-Nak, Configure-Reject,
      Terminate-Request,\n      Terminate-Ack, and Code-Reject) are used.  All other
      codes SHOULD\n      result in a TNCP Code-Reject reply.\n   Identifier and Length\n
      \     These are as documented for LCP.\n   Data\n      This field contains data
      formatted as described in Section 5 of\n      [RFC1661].  Codes 1-4 use Type-Length-Data
      sequences, Codes 5\n      and 6 use uninterpreted data, and Code 7 uses a Rejected-Packet,\n
      \     all as described in [RFC1661].\n   Because no Configuration Options have
      been defined for TNCP,\n   negotiating the use of the TRILL Protocol with IS-IS
      for the link\n   state protocol is the default when no options are specified.
      \ A\n   future document may specify the use of Configuration Options to\n   enable
      different TRILL operating modes, such as the use of a\n   different link state
      protocol.\n"
    title: 2.1.  TNCP Packet Format
  - contents:
    - "2.2.  TNP Packet Format\n   When TNCP is in the Opened state, TNP packets are
      sent by setting the\n   PPP Protocol field to hex 005d (TNP) and placing TRILL-encapsulated\n
      \  data representing exactly one encapsulated packet in the PPP\n   Information
      field.\n   A summary of this format is provided below:\n       0                   1
      \                  2                   3\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3

      \  This is identical to the TRILL Ethernet format (Section 4.1 of\n   [RFC6325],
      \"Ethernet Data Encapsulation\"), except that the Outer MAC\n   (Media Access
      Control) header and Ethertype are replaced by the PPP\n   headers and Protocol
      Field, and the Ethernet Frame Check Sequence\n   (FCS) is not present.  Both
      user data and End-Station Address\n   Distribution Information (ESADI) packets
      are encoded in this format.\n   The PPP FCS follows the encapsulated data on
      links where the PPP FCS\n   is in use.\n   Unlike the TRILL Ethernet encapsulation,
      PPP nodes do not have MAC\n   addresses, so no outer MAC is present.  (High-Level
      Data Link Control\n   (HDLC) addresses MAY be present in some situations; such
      usage is\n   outside the scope of this document.)\n"

    - "2.3.  TLSP Packet Format\n   When TNCP is in the Opened state, TLSP packets
      are sent by setting\n   the PPP Protocol field to hex 405d (TLSP) and placing
      exactly one\n   IS-IS Payload (Section 4.2.3 of [RFC6325], \"TRILL IS-IS Frames\")
      in\n   the PPP Information field.\n   Note that point-to-point IS-IS links have
      only an arbitrary circuit\n   ID, and do not use MAC addresses for identification.\n"
    title: 2.3.  TLSP Packet Format
  title: 2.  PPP TRILL Negotiation
- contents:
  - "3.  TRILL PPP Behavior\n   1. On a PPP link, TRILL always uses point-to-point
    (P2P) Hellos.\n      There is no need for TRILL-Hello frames, nor is per-port\n
    \     configuration necessary.  P2P Hello messages, per \"Point-to-Point\n      IS
    to IS hello PDU\" (Section 9.7 of [IS-IS]), do not use Neighbor\n      IDs in
    the same manner as on Ethernet.  However, per\n      Section 4.2.4.1 of [RFC6325],
    the three-way IS-IS handshake using\n      extended circuit IDs is required on
    point-to-point links, such\n      as PPP.\n   2. RBridges are never appointed
    forwarders on PPP links.  If an\n      implementation includes BCP [RFC3518],
    then it MUST ensure that\n      only one of BCP or TNCP is negotiated on a link,
    and not both.  If\n      the peer is an RBridge, then there is no need to pass\n
    \     unencapsulated frames, as the link can have no TRILL-ignorant peer\n      to
    be concerned about.  If the peer is not an RBridge, then TNCP\n      negotiation
    fails and TRILL is not used on the link.\n   3. An implementation that has only
    PPP links might have no\n      Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) that can
    form an IS-IS\n      System ID.  Resolving that issue is outside the scope of
    this\n      document; however, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that all TRILL\n      implementations
    have at least one zero-configuration mechanism to\n      obtain a valid System
    ID.  Refer to ISO/IEC 10589 [IS-IS]\n      regarding System ID uniqueness requirements.\n
    \  4. TRILL MTU-probe and TRILL MTU-ack messages (Section 4.3.2 of\n      [RFC6325])
    are not needed on a PPP link.  Implementations MUST NOT\n      send MTU-probe
    messages and SHOULD NOT reply to these messages.\n      The MTU computed by LCP
    SHOULD be used instead.  Negotiating an\n      LCP MTU of at least 1524, to allow
    for an inner Ethernet payload\n      of 1500 octets, is RECOMMENDED.\n"
  title: 3.  TRILL PPP Behavior
- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Existing PPP and IS-IS security mechanisms may
    play important roles\n   in a network of RBridges interconnected by PPP links.
    \ At the TRILL\n   IS-IS layer, the IS-IS authentication mechanism [RFC5304] [RFC5310]\n
    \  prevents fabrication of link-state control messages.\n   Not all implementations
    need to include specific security mechanisms\n   at the PPP layer, for example
    if they are designed to be deployed\n   only in cases where the networking environment
    is trusted or where\n   other layers provide adequate security.  A complete enumeration
    of\n   possible deployment scenarios and associated threats and options is\n   not
    possible and is outside the scope of this document.  For\n   applications involving
    sensitive data, end-to-end security should\n   always be considered in addition
    to link security to provide security\n   in depth.\n   However, in case a PPP
    layer authentication mechanism is needed to\n   protect the establishment of a
    link and identify a link with a known\n   peer, implementation of the PPP Challenge
    Handshake Authentication\n   Protocol (CHAP) [RFC1994] is RECOMMENDED.  Should
    greater flexibility\n   than that provided by CHAP be required, the Extensible
    Authentication\n   Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] is a good alternative.\n   If TRILL-over-PPP
    packets also require confidentiality, the PPP\n   Encryption Control Protocol
    (ECP) link encryption mechanisms\n   [RFC1968] can protect the confidentiality
    and integrity of all\n   packets on the PPP link.\n   And when PPP is run over
    tunneling mechanisms, such as the Layer Two\n   Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) [RFC3931],
    tunnel security protocols may be\n   available.\n   For general TRILL protocol
    security considerations, see [RFC6325].\n"

    005d, 405d, and\n   805d, as described in Section 1 of this document.\n   IANA
    has created a new \"PPP TNCP Configuration Option Types\" registry\n   in the
    PPP-Numbers registry, using the same format as the existing\n   \"PPP LCP Configuration
    Option Types\" registry.\n   All TNCP Configuration Option Types except 0 are
    \"Unassigned\" and\n   available for future use, based on \"IETF Review\", as
    described in\n   BCP 26 [RFC5226].  Option 0 is allocated for use with Vendor-Specific\n
    \  Options, as described in [RFC2153].\n"
