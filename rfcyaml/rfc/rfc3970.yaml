  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information
    Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n
    \  In particular, it describes managed objects for Traffic Engineered\n   (TE)
    Tunnels; for example, Multi-Protocol Label Switched Paths ([7],\n   [8]).  The
    MIB module defined by this memo allows one to configure TE\n   Tunnels, to assign
    one or more paths to a Tunnel, and to monitor\n   operational aspects of the Tunnel,
    such as the number of octets and\n   packets that have passed through the Tunnel.\n
    \  As it stands, this MIB module can only be used to configure or\n   monitor
    a TE Tunnel at its ingress.  The ingress is then expected to\n   use some protocol
    (such as RSVP-TE) to signal the other routers in\n   the path the information
    they need to set up the tunnel.  The\n   extension of this module for use at other
    points of a Tunnel is for\n   further study.\n"

  - "2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of
    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to Section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [8].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [2], STD 58, RFC 2579 [3] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [4].\n"
  title: 2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

  - "3.  Overview of the MIB Module\n   The Traffic Engineering MIB module consists
    of four parts:\n      1) Traffic Engineering information,\n      2) a table of
    Traffic Engineering Tunnels,\n      3) a table of Paths that tunnels take, and\n
    \     4) a table of Hops that make up a tunnel path.\n   The MIB module also has
    statements for minimal and full compliance.\n   The following subsections give
    an overview of each part.  All objects\n   are mandatory.  For minimal compliance,
    all objects MAY be\n   implemented read-only; for full compliance, all objects
    must be\n   implemented to their stated MAX-ACCESS capabilities.  Notifications\n
    \  are optional.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Traffic Engineering Information\n   This part contains information about
      the Link State Protocols used to\n   carry TE information, the signaling protocols
      used to set up Traffic\n   Tunnels, the number of Traffic Tunnels that have
      been configured and\n   that are operational, and a mapping of Administrative
      Group (called\n   Resource Classes in [7]) numbers to names.\n"
    title: 3.1.  Traffic Engineering Information
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Traffic Tunnel Information\n   This part contains a table of Traffic
      Tunnels and information about\n   each one.  This information includes the Tunnel
      name, its\n   configuration information, its operational information, and the\n
      \  active path(s) that the Tunnel takes.\n   Configuration information includes
      the end points of the Traffic\n   Tunnel, and the number of configured paths
      for the Traffic Tunnel.\n   Operational information includes the current state
      (up/down), the\n   count of octets and packets sent on the Traffic Tunnel, how
      long it\n   has been up, and how many state transitions the Traffic Tunnel has\n
      \  had.\n   Operational path information includes the number of operational\n
      \  paths, the number of path changes, and when the last path change was.\n"
    title: 3.2.  Traffic Tunnel Information
  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Path Information\n   A Tunnel is a logical entity.  An instantiation
      of a Tunnel is one or\n   more Paths; each Path has a route (also called Explicit
      Route) or\n   sequence of hops.  A Path is indexed by a dual index: The primary\n
      \  index is that of the Tunnel to which the Path belongs; the secondary\n   index
      is that of the Path itself.\n   The configured information for a Path consists
      of the constraints for\n   the Path and a configured route.\n   The operational
      information consists of the Path status, the computed\n   route (i.e., the route
      that was computed to satisfy the constraints),\n   and the actual path as recorded
      by the signaling protocol.\n"
    title: 3.3.  Path Information
  - contents:
    - "3.4.  Hop Information\n   A path consists of a sequence of hops.  A hop can
      be loose (meaning\n   that the path eventually traverses the specified node)
      or strict\n   (meaning that the specified node and possibly the link must be
      the\n   next node in the path).  A hop can be specified as an IPv4 address,\n
      \  an IPv6 address, an Autonomous System number or an unnumbered\n   interface
      index [5].\n   The Hop Table contains all hops for all paths on a given router.
      \ It\n   is organized as follows.  There is a primary index that identifies
      a\n   list of hops and a secondary index that identifies individual hops.\n
      \  Thus, to get the sequence of recorded hops for a path, one looks up\n   the
      path's tePathRecordedRoute, which is a primary index into the Hop\n   Table.
      \ Then to get the list of actual hops in order for the recorded\n   path, one
      uses a secondary index of 1, 2, ....\n"

    - "3.5.  Relationship with Other MIB Modules\n   A TE Tunnel can extend objects
      from two other MIB modules; one is the\n   Interfaces MIB [10], and the other
      is the IP Tunnel MIB [11].  The\n   mechanism for doing so is to assign the
      TE Tunnel index\n   (teTunnelIndex) with a valid ifIndex value in ifTable.\n
      \  If a TE Tunnel is deemed an interface, a new interface object is\n   created
      and assigned an ifIndex value in ifTable.  Then a TE Tunnel\n   object is created,
      setting teTunnelIndex to the same value as the\n   interface index.\n   If (and
      only if) a TE Tunnel is considered an interface, it may also\n   be considered
      an IP tunnel (if the encapsulation of the TE Tunnel is\n   IP).  In that case,
      the interface associated with the TE Tunnel\n   should have its ifType set to
      tunnel(131).\n   If a TE Tunnel is not considered an interface, then the TE
      Tunnel\n   index (teTunnelIndex) SHOULD be set to a value at least 2^24, so
      that\n   it is distinct from normal interfaces.\n"

  - "4.  Creating, Modifying, and Deleting a TE Tunnel\n   To create a TE Tunnel,
    one first obtains a free Tunnel index by using\n   the object teNextTunnelIndex.
    \ One then creates the Tunnel, including\n   all parameters, either as createAndGo
    or createAndWait.  Then, TE\n   Paths for this Tunnel can be created by using
    the\n   teTunnelNextPathIndex object, again as createAndGo or createAndWait.\n
    \  A particular Path is computed and signaled when both the Path and the\n   enclosing
    Tunnel have RowStatus 'active'.\n   To build a Path's configured route, one first
    gets a free PathHop\n   index by using teNextPathHopIndex, and then builds the
    route hop-by-\n   hop using the secondary index, setting the AddrType, Address,
    and\n   HopType for each Hop.  Finally, one sets the tePathConfiguredRoute in\n
    \  the Path to the PathHop index obtained.\n   Modifying certain properties of
    a TE Tunnel or a TE Path may require\n   setting the RowStatus of the Tunnel (or
    Path) to 'notInService'\n   before making the changes and then setting the RowStatus
    of the\n   Tunnel (or Path) back to 'active' to re-signal all Paths of the\n   Tunnel
    (or the modified Path).\n   A TE Tunnel and all its Paths can be deleted by setting
    the Tunnel's\n   RowStatus to 'destroy'.  A specific Path within a Tunnel can
    be\n   destroyed by setting that Path's RowStatus to 'destroy'.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB module relates to the configuration
    and management of\n   Traffic Engineering tunnels.  The unauthorized manipulation
    of fields\n   in the tables teAdminGroupTable, teTunnelTable, tePathTable, and\n
    \  tePathHopTable may lead to tunnel flapping, tunnel paths being\n   changed,
    or traffic being disrupted.  In addition, if these tables\n   are read by unauthorized
    parties, the information can be used to\n   trace traffic patterns, traffic volumes,
    and tunnel paths.  This may\n   be considered proprietary and confidential information
    by some\n   providers.\n   There are a number of management objects defined in
    this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \  teAdminGroupTable: Changing this will affect the semantics of include\n   and
    exclude constraints, and thus traffic takes unintended routes.\n   teTunnelTable:
    Changing this affects many properties of traffic\n   tunnels.\n   tePathTable:
    Changing this affects the constraints (including\n   bandwidth) of tunnel paths,
    as well as the status of the path.\n   tePathHopTable: Changing this affects the
    route followed by a traffic\n   tunnel path.\n   Some of the readable objects
    in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible)
    may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It
    is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects
    and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them
    over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \     teTunnelTable:  Describes tunnel endpoints and traffic volumes.\n      tePathTable:
    \   Describes path properties.\n      tePathHopTable: Describes path routes.\n
    \  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if
    the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there
    is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET
    (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED
    that implementers consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3
    framework (see [9], section 8), including full\n   support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
    mechanisms (for authentication\n   and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP
    versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to
    deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
    \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
    of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only
    to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET
    (change/create/delete) them.\n"
