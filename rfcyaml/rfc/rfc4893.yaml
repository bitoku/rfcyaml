  - "1.  Introduction\n   Currently the Autonomous System number is encoded as a two-octet\n\
    \   entity in BGP [BGP].  To prepare for the anticipated exhaustion of\n   the\
    \ two-octet AS numbers, this document describes extensions to BGP\n   to carry\
    \ the Autonomous System number as a four-octet entity.\n   More specifically,\
    \ this document defines a new BGP capability, Four-\n   octet AS Number Capability,\
    \ that can be used by a BGP speaker to\n   indicate its support for the four-octet\
    \ AS numbers.  Two new\n   attributes, AS4_PATH and AS4_AGGREGATOR, are introduced\
    \ that can be\n   used to propagate four-octet based AS path information across\
    \ BGP\n   speakers that do not support the four-octet AS numbers.  This\n   document\
    \ also specifies mechanisms for constructing the AS path\n   information from\
    \ the AS_PATH attribute and the AS4_PATH attribute.\n   The extensions proposed\
    \ in this document allow a gradual transition\n   from 2-octet AS numbers to 4-octet\
    \ AS numbers.\n"

- title: 3.  Protocol Extensions
  contents:
  - "3.  Protocol Extensions\n   For the purpose of this document we define a BGP\
    \ speaker that does\n   not support the new 4-octet AS number extensions as an\
    \ OLD BGP\n   speaker, and a BGP speaker which supports the new 4-octet AS number\n\
    \   extensions as a NEW BGP speaker.\n   BGP carries the Autonomous System number\
    \ in the \"My Autonomous\n   System\" field of the OPEN message, in the AS_PATH\
    \ attribute of the\n   UPDATE message, and in the AGGREGATOR attribute of the\
    \ UPDATE\n   message.  BGP also carries the Autonomous System number in the BGP\n\
    \   Communities attribute.\n   A NEW BGP speaker uses BGP Capability Advertisements\
    \ [RFC2842] to\n   advertise to its neighbors (either internal or external) that\
    \ it\n   supports 4-octet AS number extensions, as specified in this document.\n\
    \   The Capability that is used by a BGP speaker to convey to its BGP\n   peer\
    \ the 4-octet Autonomous System number capability, also carries\n   the 4-octet\
    \ Autonomous System number of the speaker in the Capability\n   Value field of\
    \ the Capability Optional Parameter.  The Capability\n   Length field of the Capability\
    \ is set to 4.\n   NEW BGP speakers carry AS path information expressed in terms\
    \ of 4-\n   octet Autonomous Systems numbers by using the existing AS_PATH\n \
    \  attribute, except that each AS number in this attribute is encoded\n   not\
    \ as a 2-octet, but as a 4-octet entity.  The same applies to the\n   AGGREGATOR\
    \ attribute - NEW BGP speakers use the same attribute,\n   except that the AS\
    \ carried in this attribute is encoded as a 4-octet\n   entity.\n   To preserve\
    \ AS path information with 4-octet AS numbers across OLD\n   BGP speakers, this\
    \ document defines a new AS path attribute, called\n   AS4_PATH.  This is an optional\
    \ transitive attribute that contains the\n   AS path encoded with 4-octet AS numbers.\
    \  The AS4_PATH attribute has\n   the same semantics as the AS_PATH attribute,\
    \ except that it is\n   optional transitive, and it carries 4-octet AS numbers.\n\
    \   To prevent the possible propagation of confederation path segments\n   outside\
    \ of a confederation, the path segment types AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE\n   and AS_CONFED_SET\
    \ [RFC3065] are declared invalid for the AS4_PATH\n   attribute.\n   Similarly,\
    \ this document defines a new aggregator attribute called\n   AS4_AGGREGATOR,\
    \ which is optional transitive.  The AS4_AGGREGATOR\n   attribute has the same\
    \ semantics as the AGGREGATOR attribute, except\n   that it carries a 4-octet\
    \ AS number.\n   Currently assigned 2-octet Autonomous System numbers are converted\n\
    \   into 4-octet Autonomous System numbers by setting the two high-order\n   octets\
    \ of the 4-octet field to zero.  Such a 4-octet AS number is\n   said to be mappable\
    \ to a 2-octet AS number.\n   To represent 4-octet AS numbers (which are not mapped\
    \ from 2-octets)\n   as 2-octet AS numbers in the AS path information encoded\
    \ with 2-octet\n   AS numbers, this document reserves a 2-octet AS number.  We\
    \ denote\n   this special AS number as AS_TRANS for ease of description in the\n\
    \   rest of this specification.  This AS number is also placed in the \"My\n \
    \  Autonomous System\" field of the OPEN message originated by a NEW BGP\n   speaker,\
    \ if the speaker does not have a (globally unique) 2-octet AS\n   number.\n"

- title: 4.2.2.  Generating Updates
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Generating Updates\n   When communicating with an OLD BGP speaker, a\
    \ NEW speaker MUST send\n   the AS path information in the AS_PATH attribute encoded\
    \ with 2-octet\n   AS numbers.  The NEW speaker MUST also send the AS path information\n\
    \   in the AS4_PATH attribute (encoded with 4-octet AS numbers), except\n   for\
    \ the case where the entire AS path information is composed of 2-\n   octet AS\
    \ numbers only.  In this case, the NEW speaker SHOULD NOT send\n   the AS4_PATH\
    \ attribute.\n   In the AS_PATH attribute encoded with 2-octet AS numbers, non-\n\
    \   mappable 4-octet AS numbers are represented by the well-known 2-octet\n  \
    \ AS number, AS_TRANS.  This will preserve the path length property of\n   the\
    \ AS path information and also help in updating the AS path\n   information received\
    \ on a NEW BGP speaker from an OLD speaker, as\n   explained in the next section.\n\
    \   The NEW speaker constructs the AS4_PATH attribute from the\n   information\
    \ carried in the AS_PATH attribute.  In the case where the\n   AS_PATH attribute\
    \ contains either AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE or AS_CONFED_SET\n   path segments, the NEW\
    \ speaker, when constructing the AS4_PATH\n   attribute from the AS_PATH attribute,\
    \ MUST exclude such path\n   segments.  The AS4_PATH attribute will be carried\
    \ across a series of\n   OLD BGP speakers without modification and will help preserve\
    \ the\n   truly 4-octet AS numbers in the AS path information.\n   Similarly,\
    \ if the NEW speaker has to send the AGGREGATOR attribute,\n   and if the aggregating\
    \ Autonomous System's AS number is truly 4-\n   octets, then the speaker constructs\
    \ the AS4_AGGREGATOR attributes by\n   taking the attribute length and attribute\
    \ value from the AGGREGATOR\n   attribute and placing them into the attribute\
    \ length and attribute\n   value of the AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute, and sets the\
    \ AS number field\n   in the existing AGGREGATOR attribute to the reserved AS\
    \ number,\n   AS_TRANS.  Note that if the AS number is 2-octets only, then the\n\
    \   AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute SHOULD NOT be sent.\n"
- title: 4.2.3.  Processing Received Updates
  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  Processing Received Updates\n   When a NEW BGP speaker receives an update\
    \ from an OLD one, it should\n   be prepared to receive the AS4_PATH attribute\
    \ along with the existing\n   AS_PATH attribute.  If the AS4_PATH attribute is\
    \ also received, both\n   the attributes will be used to construct the exact AS\
    \ path\n   information, and therefore the information carried by both the\n  \
    \ attributes will be considered for AS path loop detection.\n   Note that a route\
    \ may have traversed a series of autonomous systems\n   with 2-octet AS numbers\
    \ and OLD BGP speakers only.  In that case, if\n   the route carries the AS4_PATH\
    \ attribute, this attribute must have\n   remained unmodified since the route\
    \ left the last NEW BGP speaker.\n   The trailing AS path information (representing\
    \ autonomous systems\n   with 2-octet AS numbers and OLD BGP speakers only) is\
    \ contained only\n   in the current AS_PATH attribute (encoded in the leading\
    \ part of the\n   AS_PATH attribute).\n   Under certain conditions, it may not\
    \ be possible to reconstruct the\n   entire AS path information from the AS_PATH\
    \ and the AS4_PATH\n   attributes of a route.  This occurs when two or more routes\
    \ that\n   carry the AS4_PATH attribute are aggregated by an OLD BGP speaker,\n\
    \   and the AS4_PATH attribute of at least one of these routes carries at\n  \
    \ least one 4-octet AS number (as oppose to a 2-octet AS number that is\n   encoded\
    \ in 4 octets).  Depending on the implementation, either the\n   AS4_PATH attribute\
    \ would be lost during route aggregation, or both\n   the AS_PATH attribute and\
    \ the AS4_PATH attribute would contain valid,\n   partial information that cannot\
    \ be combined seamlessly, resulting in\n   incomplete AS path information in these\
    \ cases.\n   A NEW BGP speaker should also be prepared to receive the\n   AS4_AGGREGATOR\
    \ attribute along with the AGGREGATOR attribute from an\n   OLD BGP speaker. \
    \ When both the attributes are received, if the AS\n   number in the AGGREGATOR\
    \ attribute is not AS_TRANS, then:\n      -  the AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute and\
    \ the AS4_PATH attribute SHALL\n         be ignored,\n      -  the AGGREGATOR\
    \ attribute SHALL be taken as the information\n         about the aggregating\
    \ node, and\n      -  the AS_PATH attribute SHALL be taken as the AS path\n  \
    \       information.\n   Otherwise,\n      -  the AGGREGATOR attribute SHALL be\
    \ ignored,\n      -  the AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute SHALL be taken as the information\n\
    \         about the aggregating node, and\n      -  the AS path information would\
    \ need to be constructed, as in all\n         other cases.\n   In order to construct\
    \ the AS path information, it would be necessary\n   to first calculate the number\
    \ of AS numbers in the AS_PATH and\n   AS4_PATH attributes using the method specified\
    \ in Section 9.1.2.2\n   [BGP] and [RFC3065] for route selection.\n   If the number\
    \ of AS numbers in the AS_PATH attribute is less than the\n   number of AS numbers\
    \ in the AS4_PATH attribute, then the AS4_PATH\n   attribute SHALL be ignored,\
    \ and the AS_PATH attribute SHALL be taken\n   as the AS path information.\n \
    \  If the number of AS numbers in the AS_PATH attribute is larger than\n   or\
    \ equal to the number of AS numbers in the AS4_PATH attribute, then\n   the AS\
    \ path information SHALL be constructed by taking as many AS\n   numbers and path\
    \ segments as necessary from the leading part of the\n   AS_PATH attribute, and\
    \ then prepending them to the AS4_PATH attribute\n   so that the AS path information\
    \ has an identical number of AS numbers\n   as the AS_PATH attribute.  Note that\
    \ a valid AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE or\n   AS_CONFED_SET path segment SHALL be prepended\
    \ if it is either the\n   leading path segment or adjacent to a path segment that\
    \ is prepended.\n"
- title: 5.  Handling BGP Communities
  contents:
  - "5.  Handling BGP Communities\n   As specified in [RFC1997], when the high-order\
    \ two-octets of the\n   community attribute is neither 0x0000 nor 0xffff, these\
    \ two octets\n   encode the Autonomous System number.  Quite clearly this would\
    \ not\n   work for BGP speakers that use 4-octets Autonomous System numbers.\n\
    \   Such BGP speakers should use the Four-octet AS Specific Extended\n   Communities\
    \ [AS-EXT-COM] instead.\n"
- title: 6.  Transition
  contents:
  - "6.  Transition\n   The scheme described in this document allows a gradual transition\n\
    \   from 2-octet AS numbers to 4-octet AS numbers.  One can upgrade one\n   Autonomous\
    \ System or one BGP speaker at a time.\n   To simplify transition, this document\
    \ assumes that an Autonomous\n   System could start using a 4-octet AS number\
    \ only after all the BGP\n   speakers within that Autonomous System have been\
    \ upgraded to support\n   4-octet AS numbers.\n   An OLD BGP speaker MUST NOT\
    \ use AS_TRANS as its Autonomous System\n   number.\n   A non-mappable 4-octet\
    \ AS number cannot be used as a \"Member AS\n   Number\" of a BGP Confederation\
    \ until all the BGP speakers within the\n   Confederation have transitioned to\
    \ support 4-octet AS numbers.\n   In an environment where an Autonomous System\
    \ that has OLD BGP\n   speakers peers with two or more Autonomous Systems that\
    \ have NEW BGP\n   speakers and use AS_TRANS (rather than having a globally unique\
    \ AS\n   number), use of Multi-Exit Discriminators by the Autonomous System\n\
    \   with the OLD speakers may result in a situation where Multi-Exit\n   Discriminator\
    \ will influence route selection among the routes that\n   were received from\
    \ different neighboring Autonomous Systems.\n   Under certain conditions, it may\
    \ not be possible to reconstruct the\n   entire AS path information from the AS_PATH\
    \ and the AS4_PATH\n   attributes of a route.  This occurs when two or more routes\
    \ that\n   carry the AS4_PATH attribute are aggregated by an OLD BGP speaker,\n\
    \   and the AS4_PATH attribute of at least one of these routes carries at\n  \
    \ least one 4-octet AS number (as oppose to a 2-octet AS number that is\n   encoded\
    \ in 4 octets).  When such aggregation results in creating a\n   route that is\
    \ less specific than any of the component routes (route\n   whose Network Layer\
    \ Reachability Information (NLRI) covers NLRI of\n   all the component routes),\
    \ loss of the AS path information does not\n   create a risk of a routing loop.\
    \  In all other cases, loss of the AS\n   path information does create a risk\
    \ of a routing loop.\n"
