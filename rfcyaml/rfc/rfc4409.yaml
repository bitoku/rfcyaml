- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   SMTP was defined as a message *transfer* protocol, that\
    \ is, a means\n   to route (if needed) and deliver finished (complete) messages.\n\
    \   Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) are not supposed to alter the message\n   text,\
    \ except to add 'Received', 'Return-Path', and other header\n   fields as required\
    \ by [SMTP-MTA].\n   However, SMTP is now also widely used as a message *submission*\n\
    \   protocol, that is, a means for Message User Agents (MUAs) to\n   introduce\
    \ new messages into the MTA routing network.  The process\n   that accepts message\
    \ submissions from MUAs is termed a Message\n   Submission Agent (MSA).\n   In\
    \ order to permit unconstrained communications, SMTP is not often\n   authenticated\
    \ during message relay.\n   Authentication and authorization of initial submissions\
    \ have become\n   increasingly important, driven by changes in security requirements\n\
    \   and rising expectations that submission servers take responsibility\n   for\
    \ the message traffic they originate.\n   For example, due to the prevalence of\
    \ machines that have worms,\n   viruses, or other malicious software that generate\
    \ large amounts of\n   spam, many sites now prohibit outbound traffic on the standard\
    \ SMTP\n   port (port 25), funneling all mail submissions through submission\n\
    \   servers.\n   In addition to authentication and authorization issues, messages\n\
    \   being submitted are in some cases finished (complete) messages, and\n   in\
    \ other cases are unfinished (incomplete) in one or more aspects.\n   Unfinished\
    \ messages may need to be completed to ensure they conform\n   to [MESSAGE-FORMAT],\
    \ and later requirements.  For example, the\n   message may lack a proper 'Date'\
    \ header field, and domains might not\n   be fully qualified.  In some cases,\
    \ the MUA may be unable to generate\n   finished messages (e.g., it might not\
    \ know its time zone).  Even when\n   submitted messages are complete, local site\
    \ policy may dictate that\n   the message text be examined or modified in some\
    \ way, e.g., to\n   conceal local name or address spaces.  Such completions or\n\
    \   modifications have been shown to cause harm when performed by\n   downstream\
    \ MTAs -- that is, MTAs after the first-hop submission MTA\n   -- and are in general\
    \ considered to be outside the province of\n   standardized MTA functionality.\n\
    \   Separating messages into submissions and transfers allows developers\n   and\
    \ network administrators to more easily do the following:\n   *   Implement security\
    \ policies and guard against unauthorized mail\n       relaying or injection of\
    \ unsolicited bulk mail\n   *   Implement authenticated submission, including\
    \ off-site submission\n       by authorized users such as travelers\n   *   Separate\
    \ the relevant software code differences, thereby making\n       each code base\
    \ more straightforward and allowing for different\n       programs for relay and\
    \ submission\n   *   Detect configuration problems with a site's mail clients\n\
    \   *   Provide a basis for adding enhanced submission services in the\n     \
    \  future\n   This memo describes a low-cost, deterministic means for messages\
    \ to\n   be identified as submissions, and specifies what actions are to be\n\
    \   taken by a submission server.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Definitions of Terms Used in This Memo
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Definitions of Terms Used in This Memo\n   Many of the concepts and terms\
    \ used in this document are defined in\n   [SMTP-MTA]; familiarity with those\
    \ documents is assumed here.\n   Fully-Qualified\n   Containing or consisting\
    \ of a domain that can be globally resolved\n   using the Domain Name Service;\
    \ that is, not a local alias or partial\n   specification.\n   Message Submission\
    \ Agent (MSA)\n   A process that conforms to this specification.  An MSA acts\
    \ as a\n   submission server to accept messages from MUAs, and either delivers\n\
    \   them or acts as an SMTP client to relay them to an MTA.\n   Message Transfer\
    \ Agent (MTA)\n   A process that conforms to [SMTP-MTA].  An MTA acts as an SMTP\
    \ server\n   to accept messages from an MSA or another MTA, and either delivers\n\
    \   them or acts as an SMTP client to relay them to another MTA.\n   Message User\
    \ Agent (MUA)\n   A process that acts (often on behalf of a user and with a user\n\
    \   interface) to compose and submit new messages, and process delivered\n   messages.\n\
    \   For delivered messages, the receiving MUA may obtain and process the\n   message\
    \ according to local conventions or, in what is commonly\n   referred to as a\
    \ split-MUA model, Post Office Protocol [POP3] or IMAP\n   [IMAP4] is used to\
    \ access delivered messages, whereas the protocol\n   defined here (or SMTP) is\
    \ used to submit messages.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Submission Identification
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Submission Identification\n   Port 587 is reserved for email message submission\
    \ as specified in\n   this document.  Messages received on this port are defined\
    \ to be\n   submissions.  The protocol used is ESMTP [SMTP-MTA, ESMTP], with\n\
    \   additional restrictions or allowances as specified here.\n   Although most\
    \ email clients and servers can be configured to use port\n   587 instead of 25,\
    \ there are cases where this is not possible or\n   convenient.  A site MAY choose\
    \ to use port 25 for message submission,\n   by designating some hosts to be MSAs\
    \ and others to be MTAs.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Message Rejection and Bouncing
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Message Rejection and Bouncing\n   MTAs and MSAs MAY implement message\
    \ rejection rules that rely in part\n   on whether the message is a submission\
    \ or a relay.\n   For example, some sites might configure their MTAs to reject\
    \ all RCPT\n   commands for messages that do not reference local users, and\n\
    \   configure their MSA to reject all message submissions that do not\n   come\
    \ from authorized users, with authorization based either on\n   authenticated\
    \ identity or the submitting endpoint being within a\n   protected IP environment.\n\
    \   NOTE:  It is better to reject a message than to risk sending one that\n  \
    \ is damaged.  This is especially true for problems that are\n   correctable by\
    \ the MUA, for example, an invalid 'From' field.\n   If an MSA is not able to\
    \ determine a return path to the submitting\n   user, from a valid MAIL FROM,\
    \ a valid source IP address, or based on\n   authenticated identity, then the\
    \ MSA SHOULD immediately reject the\n   message.  A message can be immediately\
    \ rejected by returning a 550\n   code to the MAIL command.\n   Note that a null\
    \ return path, that is, MAIL FROM:<>, is permitted and\n   MUST NOT in itself\
    \ be cause for rejecting a message.  (MUAs need to\n   generate null return-path\
    \ messages for a variety of reasons,\n   including disposition notifications.)\n\
    \   Except in the case where the MSA is unable to determine a valid\n   return\
    \ path for the message being submitted, text in this\n   specification that instructs\
    \ an MSA to issue a rejection code MAY be\n   complied with by accepting the message\
    \ and subsequently generating a\n   bounce message.  (That is, if the MSA is going\
    \ to reject a message\n   for any reason except being unable to determine a return\
    \ path, it can\n   optionally do an immediate rejection or accept the message\
    \ and then\n   mail a bounce.)\n   NOTE:  In the normal case of message submission,\
    \ immediately\n   rejecting the message is preferred, as it gives the user and\
    \ MUA\n   direct feedback.  To properly handle delayed bounces, the client MUA\n\
    \   needs to maintain a queue of messages it has submitted, and match\n   bounces\
    \ to them.  Note that many contemporary MUAs do not have this\n   capability.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Authorized Submission
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Authorized Submission\n   Numerous methods have been used to ensure that\
    \ only authorized users\n   are able to submit messages.  These methods include\
    \ authenticated\n   SMTP, IP address restrictions, secure IP and other tunnels,\
    \ and prior\n   POP authentication.\n   Authenticated SMTP [SMTP-AUTH] has seen\
    \ widespread deployment.  It\n   allows the MSA to determine an authorization\
    \ identity for the message\n   submission, one that is not tied to other protocols.\n\
    \   IP address restrictions are very widely implemented, but do not allow\n  \
    \ for travelers and similar situations, and can be easily spoofed\n   unless all\
    \ transport paths between the MUA and MSA are trustworthy.\n   Secure IP [IPSEC],\
    \ and other encrypted and authenticated tunneling\n   techniques, can also be\
    \ used and provide additional benefits of\n   protection against eavesdropping\
    \ and traffic analysis.\n   Requiring a POP [POP3] authentication (from the same\
    \ IP address)\n   within some amount of time (e.g., 20 minutes) prior to the start\
    \ of a\n   message submission session has also been used, but this does impose\n\
    \   restrictions on clients as well as servers, which may cause\n   difficulties.\
    \  Specifically, the client must do a POP authentication\n   before an SMTP submission\
    \ session, and not all clients are capable\n   and configured for this.  Also,\
    \ the MSA must coordinate with the POP\n   server, which may be difficult.  There\
    \ is also a window during which\n   an unauthorized user can submit messages and\
    \ appear to be a\n   previously authorized user.  Since it is dependent on the\
    \ MUA's IP\n   addresses, this technique is substantially as subject to IP address\n\
    \   spoofing as validation based on known IP addresses alone (see above).\n"

  - "4.  Mandatory Actions\n   An MSA MUST do all of the following:\n"
- title: 4.1.  General Submission Rejection Code
  contents:
  - "4.1.  General Submission Rejection Code\n   Unless covered by a more precise\
    \ response code, response code 554 is\n   to be used to reject a MAIL, RCPT, or\
    \ DATA command that contains\n   something improper.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Ensure All Domains Are Fully-Qualified
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Ensure All Domains Are Fully-Qualified\n   The MSA MUST ensure that all\
    \ domains in the SMTP envelope are fully-\n   qualified.\n   If the MSA examines\
    \ or alters the message text in any way, except to\n   add trace header fields\
    \ [SMTP-MTA], it MUST ensure that all domains\n   in address header fields are\
    \ fully-qualified.\n   Reply code 554 is to be used to reject a MAIL, RCPT, or\
    \ DATA command\n   that contains improper domain references.\n   A frequent local\
    \ convention is to accept single-level domains (e.g.,\n   'sales') and then to\
    \ expand the reference by adding the remaining\n   portion of the domain name\
    \ (e.g., to 'sales.example.net').  Local\n   conventions that permit single-level\
    \ domains SHOULD reject, rather\n   than expand, incomplete multi-level domains\
    \ (e.g., 'squeaky.sales'),\n   since such expansion is particularly risky.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Require Authentication
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Require Authentication\n   The MSA MUST by default issue an error response\
    \ to the MAIL command\n   if the session has not been authenticated using [SMTP-AUTH],\
    \ unless\n   it has already independently established authentication or\n   authorization\
    \ (such as being within a protected subnetwork).\n   Section 3.3 discusses authentication\
    \ mechanisms.\n   Reply code 530 [SMTP-AUTH] is used for this purpose.\n"
- title: 5.  Recommended Actions
  contents:
  - "5.  Recommended Actions\n   The MSA SHOULD do all of the following:\n"
- title: 5.1.  Enforce Address Syntax
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Enforce Address Syntax\n   An MSA SHOULD reject messages with illegal syntax\
    \ in a sender or\n   recipient SMTP envelope address.\n   If the MSA examines\
    \ or alters the message text in way, except to add\n   trace header fields, it\
    \ SHOULD reject messages with illegal address\n   syntax in address header fields.\n\
    \   Reply code 501 is to be used to reject a MAIL or RCPT command that\n   contains\
    \ a detectably improper address.\n   When addresses are resolved after submission\
    \ of the message body,\n   reply code 554 (with a suitable enhanced status code\
    \ from\n   [SMTP-CODES]) is used after end-of-data, if the message contains\n\
    \   invalid addresses in the header.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Log Errors
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Log Errors\n   The MSA SHOULD log message errors, especially apparent\n\
    \   misconfigurations of client software.\n   It can be very helpful to notify\
    \ the administrator when problems are\n   detected with local mail clients.  This\
    \ is another advantage of\n   distinguishing submission from relay: system administrators\
    \ might be\n   interested in local configuration problems, but not in client\n\

    \ port.\n   Some SMTP extensions are especially useful for message submission:\n\
    \   Extended Status Codes [SMTP-CODES] SHOULD be supported and used\n   according\
    \ to [CODES-EXTENSION].  This permits the MSA to notify the\n   client of specific\

    \ senders than is needed\n   [PIPELINING] SHOULD be supported by the MSA.\n  \
    \ [SMTP-AUTH] allows the MSA to validate the authority and determine\n   the identity\
    \ of the submitting user and MUST be supported by the MSA.\n   Any references\

- title: 8.  Message Modifications
  contents:
  - "8.  Message Modifications\n   Sites MAY modify submissions to ensure compliance\
    \ with standards and\n   site policy.  This section describes a number of such\
    \ modifications\n   that are often considered useful.\n   NOTE:  As a matter of\
    \ guidance for local decisions to implement\n   message modification, a paramount\
    \ rule is to limit such actions to\n   remedies for specific problems that have\
    \ clear solutions.  This is\n   especially true with address elements.  For example,\
    \ indiscriminately\n   appending a domain to an address or element that lacks\
    \ one typically\n   results in more broken addresses.  An unqualified address\
    \ must be\n   verified to be a valid local part in the domain before the domain\
    \ can\n   be safely added.\n   Any message forwarded or delivered by the MSA MUST\
    \ conform to the\n   requirements of [SMTP-MTA] and [MESSAGE-FORMAT].\n"
- title: 8.1.  Add 'Sender'
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Add 'Sender'\n   The MSA MAY add or replace the 'Sender' field, if the\
    \ identity of the\n   sender is known and this is not given in the 'From' field.\n\
    \   The MSA MUST ensure that any address it places in a 'Sender' field is\n  \
    \ in fact a valid mail address.\n"
- title: 8.2.  Add 'Date'
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Add 'Date'\n   The MSA MAY add a 'Date' field to the submitted message,\
    \ if it lacks\n   it, or correct the 'Date' field if it does not conform to\n\
    \   [MESSAGE-FORMAT] syntax.\n"
- title: 8.3.  Add 'Message-ID'
  contents:
  - "8.3.  Add 'Message-ID'\n   The MSA SHOULD add or replace the 'Message-ID' field,\
    \ if it lacks it,\n   or it is not valid syntax (as defined by [MESSAGE-FORMAT]).\
    \  Note\n   that a number of clients still do not generate Message-ID fields.\n"
- title: 8.4.  Transfer Encode
  contents:
  - "8.4.  Transfer Encode\n   The MSA MAY apply transfer encoding to the message\
    \ according to MIME\n   conventions, if needed and not harmful to the MIME type.\n"
- title: 8.5.  Sign the Message
  contents:
  - "8.5.  Sign the Message\n   The MSA MAY (digitally) sign or otherwise add authentication\n\
    \   information to the message.\n"
- title: 8.6.  Encrypt the Message
  contents:
  - "8.6.  Encrypt the Message\n   The MSA MAY encrypt the message for transport to\
    \ reflect\n   organizational policies.\n   NOTE:  To be useful, the addition of\
    \ a signature and/or encryption by\n   the MSA generally implies that the connection\
    \ between the MUA and MSA\n   must itself be secured in some other way, for example,\
    \ by operating\n   inside of a secure environment, by securing the submission\
    \ connection\n   at the transport layer, or by using an [SMTP-AUTH] mechanism\
    \ that\n   provides for session integrity.\n"
- title: 8.7.  Resolve Aliases
  contents:
  - "8.7.  Resolve Aliases\n   The MSA MAY resolve aliases (CNAME records) for domain\
    \ names, in the\n   SMTP envelope and optionally in address fields of the header,\
    \ subject\n   to local policy.\n   NOTE:  Unconditionally resolving aliases could\
    \ be harmful.  For\n   example, if www.example.net and ftp.example.net are both\
    \ aliases for\n   mail.example.net, rewriting them could lose useful information.\n"
- title: 8.8.  Header Rewriting
  contents:
  - "8.8.  Header Rewriting\n   The MSA MAY rewrite local parts and/or domains in\
    \ the SMTP envelope,\n   and optionally in address fields of the header, according\
    \ to local\n   policy.  For example, a site may prefer to rewrite 'JRU' as\n \
    \  'J.Random.User' in order to hide login names, and/or to rewrite\n   'squeaky.sales.example.net'\
    \ as 'zyx.example.net' to hide machine\n   names and make it easier to move users.\n\
    \   However, only addresses, local-parts, or domains which match specific\n  \
    \ local MSA configuration settings should be altered.  It would be very\n   dangerous\
    \ for the MSA to apply data-independent rewriting rules, such\n   as always deleting\
    \ the first element of a domain name.  So, for\n   example, a rule that strips\
    \ the left-most element of the domain, if\n   the complete domain matches '*.foo.example.net',\
    \ would be acceptable.\n   The MSA MUST NOT rewrite a forward-pointing (destination)\
    \ address in\n   a way that violates the constraints of [SMTP-MTA] on modifications\
    \ of\n   local-parts.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Separation of submission and relay of messages\
    \ allows a site to\n   implement different policies for the two types of services,\
    \ including\n   requiring use of additional security mechanisms for one or both.\
    \  It\n   can do this in a way which is simpler, both technically and\n   administratively.\
    \  This increases the likelihood that policies will\n   be applied correctly.\n\
    \   Separation also can aid in tracking and preventing unsolicited bulk\n   email.\n\
    \   For example, a site could configure its mail servers such that the\n   MSA\
    \ requires authentication before accepting a message, and the MTA\n   rejects\
    \ all RCPT commands for non-local users.  This can be an\n   important element\
    \ in a site's total email security policy.\n   If a site fails to require any\
    \ form of authorization for message\n   submissions (see section 3.3 for discussion),\
    \ it is allowing open use\n   of its resources and name; unsolicited bulk email\
    \ can be injected\n   using its facilities.\n   Section 3 includes further discussion\
    \ of issues with some\n   authentication methods.\n   Section 5.2 includes a cautionary\
    \ note that unlimited logging can\n   enable certain forms of denial of service\
    \ attacks.\n"
