Abstract This document reclassifies the RFCs related to the United States National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B cryptographic algorithms as Historic, and it discusses the reasons for doing so.
This document moves seven Informational RFCs to Historic status: RFCs 5759, 6239, 6318, 6379, 6380, 6403, and 6460.
In addition, it moves three obsolete Informational RFCs to Historic status: RFCs 4869, 5008, and 5430.
Introduction Several RFCs profile security protocols for use with the National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B Cryptography.
Suite B is no longer supported by NSA, and the web pages that specify the cryptographic algorithms are no longer available.
In July 2015, NSA published the Committee for National Security Systems Advisory Memorandum 02 15 as the first step in replacing Suite B with NSA's Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite.
Information about the CNSA Suite can be found in [CNSA].
As indicated in [CNSA], NSA is transitioning from Suite B to the CNSA Suite.
As a result, the profiles of the security protocols for the Suite B algorithms are now only of historic interest.
The RFCs Related to Suite B Between 2007 and 2012, several Suite B related RFCs were published to profile security protocols for use with the Suite B algorithms.
They are:  [RFC4869], "Suite B Cryptographic Suites for IPsec" (Obsoleted by RFC 6379)
"Suite B in Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)"
[RFC5430], "Suite B Profile for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"
"  [RFC6380], "Suite B Profile for Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)
"  [RFC6403], "Suite B Profile of Certificate Management over CMS"  [RFC6460], "Suite B Profile for Transport Layer Security (TLS)" 4.
Documents That Reference the Suite B Related RFCs
These RFCs reference each other several times.
These cross  references are not examined further in this document.
Other RFCs make reference to these Suite B related RFCs; these references are discussed in the following subsections.
One other RFC makes reference to RFC 4869
RFC 6071, "IP Security (IPsec) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Document Roadmap" [RFC6071], points out that RFC 4869 adds four pre  defined suites based upon Suite B specifications.
They are:  IKE/ESP suite "Suite B GCM 128"  IKE/ESP suite "Suite B GCM 256
"  IKE/AH suite "Suite B GMAC 128"
IKE/AH suite "Suite B GMAC 256
In each case, these suite definitions make use of algorithms that are defined in other RFCs.
No interoperability or security concerns are raised if implementations continue to make use of these suite names.
One other RFC makes reference to RFC 5759
RFC 6187, "X.509v3 Certificates for Secure Shell Authentication" [RFC6187], points out that RFC 5759 provides additional guidance for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) keys when used with Suite B. 4.3.
One other RFC makes reference to RFC 6379 [RFC6379].
RFC 7321, "Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH)
" [RFC7321], points out that the AES GCM algorithm is used by Suite B, and it has emerged as the preferred authenticated encryption method in IPsec.
RFC 7321 has since been obsoleted by RFC 8221.
Two other RFCs make reference to RFC 6403
RFC 6402, "Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) Updates" [RFC6402], says that development of the profile for Suite B was the activity that demonstrated the need for these updates.
RFC 7030, "Enrollment over Secure Transport" [RFC7030], points out that the scenarios in Appendix of RFC 6403 are very similar to three of the scenarios described.
Three other RFCs make reference to RFC 6460 [RFC6460].
RFC 6605, "Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) for DNSSEC" [RFC6605], states that material was copied liberally from RFC 6460.
The Standards Track status of RFC 6605 is not affected by RFC 6460 moving to Historic status.
RFC 7525, "Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)" [RFC7525], observes that the Suite B profile of TLS 1.2 uses different ciphersuites.
RFC 8253, "PCEPS: Usage of TLS to Provide a Secure Transport for the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)" [RFC8253], points to RFC 6460 for the TLS ECDHE ECDSA WITH AES 128 GCM SHA256 and TLS ECDHE
ECDSA WITH AES 256 GCM SHA384 ciphersuites.
Both of these ciphersuites are defined in [RFC5289], which would have been a better reference.
The Standards Track status of RFC 8253 is not affected by RFC 6460 moving to Historic status.
Impact of Reclassifying the Suite B Related RFCs to Historic
No interoperability or security concerns are raised by reclassifying the Suite B related RFCs to Historic status.
As described in Section 4, none of the RFCs being moved to Historic status is the sole specification of a cryptographic algorithm or an identifier for a cryptographic algorithm.
This document has no IANA actions.
No interoperability or security concerns are raised by reclassifying the Suite B related RFCs to Historic status.
NSA is transitioning away from some of the cryptographic algorithms and key sizes that were employed in the Suite B profiles.
