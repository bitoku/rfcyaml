- title: 1. Status of this Memo
  contents:
  - "1. Status of this Memo\n   The purpose of this RFC is to inform implementors\
    \ of multimedia\n   systems about our experiences using ISO 8613: Office Document\n\
    \   Architecture (ODA).  Because ODA is being proposed as an encoding\n   format\
    \ for use in multimedia mail and file exchange, implementors\n   wishing to use\
    \ ODA in an open systems environment may profit from our\n   experiences.  This\
    \ memo provides information for the Internet\n   community.  It does not specify\
    \ any standard.  Distribution of this\n   memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: 2. Overview
  contents:
  - "2. Overview\n   ODA is a recently approved ISO (8613) and CCITT (T.410) standard\
    \ for\n   representing documents containing multifont text, raster images and\n\
    \   geometric graphics.  This encoding has been specified for use in a\n   number\
    \ of related standards, such as X.400.\n   However, ODA is a very abstract standard,\
    \ defining entities such as\n   \"composite logical object classes\" and not common\
    \ entities, such as\n   \"paragraphs\".  Therefore, effective use of ODA as an\
    \ interchange\n   medium requires the definition of a document application profile\n\
    \   (dap) that defines some common entities and a map between ODA\n   entities\
    \ defined in the dap and entities used in the interchanged\n   systems.\n"
- title: 3. EXPRES Experiences
  contents:
  - "3. EXPRES Experiences\n   The National Science Foundation funded the EXPRES project,\
    \ which\n   consisted of groups at Carnegie Mellon University (Information\n \
    \  Technology Center) and the University of Michigan (Center for\n   Information\
    \ Technology Integration).  These two groups collaborated\n   with groups at McDonnell-Douglas\
    \ Aerospace Information Systems, NIST,\n   and Interleaf.  Together, the five\
    \ groups investigated the use of ODA\n   as an interchange medium for submitting\
    \ research proposals by\n   electronic mail to the National Science Foundation.\n\
    \   Part of the investigations yielded strategies for using ODA. We based\n  \
    \ our strategies on the NIST dap and the features provided by the\n   Andrew,\
    \ Diamond, and Interleaf systems.  Our experiences been\n   documented and published\
    \ in a book [1].  The discussion may be\n   valuable for others who wish to use\
    \ ODA as an interchange medium.\n"
