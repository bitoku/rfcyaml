- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This RFC defines the format of two new Resource Records (RRs)\
    \ for the\n   Domain Name System (DNS), and reserves corresponding DNS type\n\
    \   mnemonic and numerical codes.  This format may be used with the any\n   proposal\
    \ that has variable length addresses, but is targeted for CLNP\n   use.\n   This\
    \ memo assumes that the reader is familiar with the DNS [3,4].\n"
- title: Background
  contents:
  - "Background\n   This section describes an experimental representation of NSAP\n\
    \   addresses in the DNS. There are several reasons to take this approch.\n  \
    \ First, it provides simple documentation of the correct addresses to\n   use\
    \ in static configurations of CLNP compliant hosts and routers.\n   NSAP support\
    \ requires that a new DNS resource record entry type\n   (\"NSAP\") be defined,\
    \ to store longer Internet (i.e., NSAP) addresses.\n   This resource record allows\
    \ mapping from DNS names to NSAP addresses,\n   and will contain entries for systems\
    \ which are able to run Internet\n   applications, over TCP or UDP, over CLNP.\n\
    \   The backward translation (from NSAP address to DNS name) is\n   facilitated\
    \ by definition of an associated resource record. This\n   resource record is\
    \ known as \"NSAP-PTR\", and is used in a manner\n   analogous to the existing\
    \ \"in-addr.arpa\".\n   These RRs are intended for use in a proposal [6] by one\
    \ of the\n   members of the NOOP WG to address the next-generation internet.\n"
- title: The NSAP RR
  contents:
  - "The NSAP RR\n   The NSAP RR is defined with mnemonic NSAP and type code 22 (decimal).\n\
    \   An NSAP (Network Service Access Protocol) number is a unique string\n   to\
    \ OSI transport service.\n   The numbering plan follows RFC 1237 and associated\
    \ OSI definitions\n   for NSAP format.\n   NSAP has the following format:\n  \
    \ <owner> <ttl> <class> NSAP <length> <NSAP-address>\n   All fields are required.\n\
    \   <length> identifies the number of octets in the <NSAP-address> as\n   defined\
    \ by the various national and international authorities.\n   <NSAP-address> enumerates\
    \ the actual octet values assigned by the\n   assigning authority.  Its format\
    \ in master files is a <character-\n   string> syntactically identical to that\
    \ used in TXT and HINFO.\n   The format of NSAP is class insensitive.  NSAP RR\
    \ causes no\n   additional section processing.\n   For example:\n"

    \ is the ASCII representation of the digits.  It is encoded\n   as two <character-strings>,\
    \ i.e., count followed by characters.\n"
- title: The NSAP-PTR RR
  contents:
  - "The NSAP-PTR RR\n   The NSAP-PTR RR is defined with mnemonic NSAP-PTR and a type\
    \ code 23\n   (decimal).\n   Its function is analogous to the PTR record used\
    \ for IP addresses\n   [4,7].\n   NSAP-PTR has the following format:\n   <NSAP-suffix>\
    \ <ttl> <class> NSAP-PTR <owner>\n   All fields are required.\n   <NSAP-suffix>\
    \ enumerates the actual octet values assigned by the\n   assigning authority for\
    \ the LOCAL network.  Its format in master\n   files is a <character-string> syntactically\
    \ identical to that used in\n   TXT and HINFO.\n   The format of NSAP-PTR is class\
    \ insensitive.  NSAP-PTR RR causes no\n   additional section processing.\n   For\
    \ example:\n   In net ff08000574.nsap-in-addr.arpa:\n   444433332222111199990123000000ff\
    \    NSAP-PTR   foo.bar.com.\n   Or in net 11110031f67293.nsap-in-addr.arpa:\n\
    \   67894444333322220000  NSAP-PTR        host.school.de.\n   The RR data is the\
    \ ASCII representation of the digits.  It is encoded\n   as a <character-string>.\n"
