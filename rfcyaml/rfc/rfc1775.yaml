  - "Abstract\n   The Internet permits different levels of access for consumers and\n\
    \   providers of service.  The nature of those differences is quite\n   important\
    \ in the capabilities They afford.  Hence, it is appropriate\n   to provide terminology\
    \ that distinguishes among the range, so that\n   the Internet community can gain\
    \ some clarity when distinguishing\n   whether a user (or an organization) is\
    \ \"on\" the Internet.  This\n   document suggests four terms, for distinguishing\
    \ the major classes of\n   access.\n"

  - "1.   INTRODUCTION\n   The Internet is many things to many people.  It began as\
    \ a technology\n   and has grown into a global service.  With the growth has come\n\
    \   increased complexity in details of the technology and service,\n   resulting\
    \ in confusion when trying to determine whether a given user\n   is \"on\" the\
    \ Internet.  Who is on the Internet?  What capabilities do\n   they have?  This\
    \ note is an attempt to aid Internet consumers and\n   providers in determining\
    \ the basic types of end-user access that\n   distinguish critical differences\
    \ in Internet attachment.\n   The list was developed primarily for the perspective\
    \ of users, rather\n   than for the technical community. The definitions in this\
    \ list take\n   the perspective that users are primarily interested in application\n\
    \   services.   A curious implication is that some of the definitions do\n   not\
    \ rely on the direct use of the underlying Internet connectivity\n   protocols,\
    \ TCP/IP.  For many technical discussions, therefore, these\n   terms will not\
    \ be appropriate.\n"
- title: 2.   LABELS FOR INTERNET ACCESS
  contents:
  - "2.   LABELS FOR INTERNET ACCESS\n   The following definitions move from \"most\"\
    \ to \"least\" Internet\n   access, from the perspective of the user (consumer).\
    \ The first term\n   is primarily applicable to Internet service providers.  The\
    \ remaining\n   terms are primarily applicable to consumers of Internet service.\n\
    \   FULL ACCESS\n      This is a permanent (full-time) Internet attachment running\n\
    \      TCP/IP, primarily appropriate for allowing the Internet community\n   \
    \   to access application servers, operated by Internet service\n      providers.\
    \  Machines with Full access are directly visible to\n      others attached to\
    \ the Internet, such as through the Internet\n      Protocol's ICMP Echo (ping)\
    \ facility.  The core of the Internet\n      comprises those machines with Full\
    \ access.\n   CLIENT ACCESS\n      The user runs applications that employ Internet\
    \ application\n      protocols directly on their own computer platform, but might\
    \ not\n      be running underlying Internet protocols  (TCP/IP), might not have\n\
    \      full-time access, such as through dial-up, or might have\n      constrained\
    \ access, such as through a firewall.  When active,\n      Client users might\
    \ be visible to the general Internet, but such\n      visibility cannot be predicted.\
    \  For example, this means that most\n      Client access users will not be detected\
    \ during an empirical\n      probing of systems \"on\" the Internet at any given\
    \ moment, such as\n      through the ICMP Echo facility.\n   MEDIATED ACCESS\n\
    \      The user runs no Internet applications on their own platform.  An\n   \
    \   Internet service provider runs applications that use Internet\n      protocols\
    \ on the provider's platform, for the user.  User has\n      simplified access\
    \ to the provider, such as dial-up terminal\n      connectivity.  For Mediated\
    \ access, the user is on the Internet,\n      but their computer platform is not.\
    \  Instead, it is the computer\n      of the mediating service (provider) which\
    \ is on the Internet.\n   MESSAGING ACCESS\n      The user has no Internet access,\
    \ except through electronic mail\n      and through netnews, such as Usenet or\
    \ a bulletin board service.\n      Since messaging services can be used as a high-latency\
    \ -- i.e.,\n      slow -- transport service, the use of this level of access for\n\
    \      mail-enabled services can be quite powerful, though not\n      interactive.\n"
- title: 3.   SAMPLE USAGE
  contents:
  - "3.   SAMPLE USAGE\n   The test of a nomenclature is, of course, its application\
    \ to real-\n   life situations.  Two simple cases involve home users.  If a user\n\
    \   accesses the Internet by running a terminal program on their PC and\n   then\
    \ dials up a public service which provides the Internet\n   applications, then\
    \ that user has Mediated Internet access.  The\n   public service has Client or\
    \ Full access, but the user does not.  On\n   the other hand, users who access\
    \ via SLIP or PPP are running Internet\n   applications on their own PCs and they\
    \ have Client Internet access.\n   Many corporations now have a full-time link\
    \ to the Internet.  The\n   link is based on TCP/IP and usually has a number of\
    \ Internet servers\n   running, for email exchange and for making public corporate\
    \ data\n   available to the rest of the world, such as through the World Wide\n\
    \   Web and Gopher.  Clearly, the corporation is \"on\" the Internet, with\n \
    \  Full Internet access.\n   What about a user in that corporation?  Many corporations\
    \ today\n   separate their internal internet from the public Internet via a\n\
    \   firewall.  If a user from the internal internet has a desktop\n   computer\
    \ and reaches out to the Internet, through the firewall, by\n   running any Internet\
    \ applications, such as a Web browser, then that\n   user has Client Internet\
    \ access.\n   Some corporations will not allow this, instead requiring all software\n\
    \   which touches the public Internet to be run on specially-administered\n  \
    \ machines which are part of the corporation's firewall suite of\n   services.\
    \  Hence, users must make a terminal connection to the\n   special machines, from\
    \ there running the Internet applications.  Such\n   users have Mediated Internet\
    \ access, the same as home users who dial\n   up a public service.\n"
- title: 4.   SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
  contents:
  - "4.   SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n   This specification does NOT, itself, provide\
    \ or define any security-\n   related mechanisms.  However it does describe scenarios\
    \ with\n   different security implications for users and providers.  Readers of\n\
    \   this discussion are cautioned to consider those implications when\n   choosing\
    \ a service.\n"
- title: 5.   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
  contents:
  - "5.   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n   Development of these definitions was spurred by many\
    \ public and\n   private discussions in which confusion over Internet access reigned.\n\
    \   Convergence on an initial set of three terms was the result of\n   discussion\
    \ on the Big-Internet mailing list, particularly from\n   comments made by Alan\
    \ Barret, Howard Berkowitz, Noel Chiappa, Steve\n   Goldstein, Iain Hanson, Gary\
    \ Malkin, Bob McKisson, Tim O'Reilly, Dave\n   Piscitello and Bill Simpson.  Eventually,\
    \ the need for a fourth\n   category became evident and was discussed further\
    \ with the\n   participants on the list.  This does not mean that any of them\n\
    \   necessarily endorses the terms and definitions provided, merely that\n   their\
    \ notes assisted my thinking on the topic.  After the initial\n   round of public\
    \ discussion, Smoot Carl-Mitchell and John Quarterman\n   of Texas Internet Consulting\
    \ developed terminology for similar\n   categories and served to prompt modification\
    \ of this set, described,\n   here, to distinguish between provider and consumer\
    \ forms of access\n   and emphasize the role of Full access in defining the Internet\
    \ core.\n"
