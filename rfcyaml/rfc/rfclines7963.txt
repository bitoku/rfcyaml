Abstract RFCs 4328 and 7139 provide signaling extensions in Resource ReserVation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP TE) to control the full set of Optical Transport Network (OTN) features.
However, these specifications do not cover the additional Optical channel Data Unit (ODU) containers defined in G.Sup43 (ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2).
This document defines new Signal Types for these additional containers.
Introduction [RFC7139] updates the portions of text related to the Optical channel Data Unit (ODU) described in [RFC4328] to provide extensions to Resource ReserVation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP TE) to support control for [G.709 v3] in the OTN TDM SENDER TSPEC and OTN
However, it does not specify Signal Types for the ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2 containers defined in [G.Sup43].
This document provides RSVP TE signaling extensions to support these additional Signal Types.
These containers are non standard data plane frame formats (not defined in ITU T Recommendations).
They are among some of the intra  domain approaches used in networks to transport 10GBASE R signals in optical transport networks.
As a supplement, [G.Sup43] does not guarantee interoperability in the data plane for these containers.
RSVP TE Extension for Additional Signal Types [RFC7139] defines the format of Traffic Parameters in OTN TDM SENDER TSPEC and OTN TDM FLOWSPEC objects.
These traffic parameters have a Signal Type field.
This document defines the Signal Types for ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2, as defined in the IANA Considerations section.
They are allocated via the Specification Required policy added to the subregistry by [RFC7892].
This document does not introduce any additional security issues beyond those identified in [RFC7139].
IANA Considerations IANA maintains the "Generalized Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry that contains the "OTN Signal Type" subregistry.
These Signal Types are carried in the Traffic Parameters in OTN TDM SENDER TSPEC and OTN TDM FLOWSPEC objects [RFC7139].
