  - "Abstract\n   Using the base loss metric defined in RFC 2680, this document defines\n\
    \   two derived metrics \"loss distance\" and \"loss period\", and the\n   associated\
    \ statistics that together capture loss patterns experienced\n   by packet streams\
    \ on the Internet.  The Internet exhibits certain\n   specific types of behavior\
    \ (e.g., bursty packet loss) that can affect\n   the performance seen by the users\
    \ as well as the operators.  The loss\n   pattern or loss distribution is a key\
    \ parameter that determines the\n   performance observed by the users for certain\
    \ real-time applications\n   such as packet voice and video.  For the same loss\
    \ rate, two\n   different loss distributions could potentially produce widely\n\
    \   different perceptions of performance.\n"

- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   In certain real-time applications (such as packet voice and\
    \ video),\n   the loss pattern or loss distribution is a key parameter that\n\
    \   determines the performance observed by the users.  For the same loss\n   rate,\
    \ two different loss distributions could potentially produce\n   widely different\
    \ perceptions of performance.  The impact of loss\n   pattern is also extremely\
    \ important for non-real-time applications\n   that use an adaptive protocol such\
    \ as TCP.  Refer to [4], [5], [6],\n   [11] for evidence as to the importance\
    \ and existence of loss\n   burstiness and its effect on packet voice and video\
    \ applications.\n   Previously, the focus of the IPPM had been on specifying base\
    \ metrics\n   such as delay, loss and connectivity under the framework described\
    \ in\n   RFC 2330.  However, specific Internet behaviors can also be captured\n\
    \   under the umbrella of the IPPM framework, specifying new concepts\n   while\
    \ reusing existing guidelines as much as possible.  In this\n   document, we propose\
    \ two derived metrics, called \"loss distance\" and\n   \"loss period\", with\
    \ associated statistics, to capture packet loss\n   patterns.  The loss period\
    \ metric captures the frequency and length\n   (burstiness) of loss once it starts,\
    \ and the loss distance metric\n   captures the spacing between the loss periods.\
    \  It is important to\n   note that these metrics are derived based on the base\
    \ metric Type-P-\n   One-Way-packet-Loss.\n"

- title: 3. The Approach
  contents:
  - "3. The Approach\n   This document closely follows the guidelines specified in\
    \ [3].\n   Specifically, the concepts of singleton, sample, statistic,\n   measurement\
    \ principles, Type-P packets, as well as standard-formed\n   packets all apply.\
    \  However, since the document proposes to capture\n   specific Internet behaviors,\
    \ modifications to the sampling process\n   MAY be needed.  Indeed, this is mentioned\
    \ in [1], where it is noted\n   that alternate sampling procedures may be useful\
    \ depending on\n   specific circumstances.  This document proposes that the specific\n\
    \   behaviors be captured as \"derived\" metrics from the base metrics the\n \
    \  behaviors are related to.  The reasons for adopting this position are\n   the\
    \ following:\n   -  it provides consistent usage of singleton metric definition\
    \ for\n      different behaviors (e.g., a single definition of packet loss is\n\
    \      needed for capturing burst of losses, 'm out of n' losses etc.)\n   - \
    \ it allows re-use of the methodologies specified for the singleton\n      metric\
    \ with modifications whenever necessary\n   -  it clearly separates few base metrics\
    \ from many Internet behaviors\n   Following the guidelines in [3], this translates\
    \ to deriving sample\n   metrics from the respective singletons.  The process\
    \ of deriving\n   sample metrics from the singletons is specified in [3], [1],\
    \ and\n   others.\n   In the following sections, we apply this approach to a particular\n\
    \   Internet behavior, namely the packet loss process.\n"

    \ sample are\n                    given sequence numbers that are consecutive\n\

    \               how to associate sequence numbers with packets.  The\n       \
    \             sequence numbers could be contained within test\n              \
    \      packets themselves, or they could be derived through\n                \
    \    post-processing of the sample.\n   Bursty loss: The loss involving consecutive\
    \ packets of a stream.\n   Loss Distance: The difference in sequence numbers of\

    \ by\n                  successfully received packets.\n   Example: In a packet\
    \ stream, the packet with sequence number 20 is\n            considered lost,\
    \ followed by the packet with sequence number\n            50.  The loss distance\
    \ is 30.\n   Loss period: Let P_i be the i'th packet.  Define f(P_i) = 1 if P_i\
    \ is\n                lost, 0 otherwise.  Then, a loss period begins if\n    \
    \            f(P_i) = 1 and f(P_(i-1)) = 0\n   Example: Consider the following\
    \ sequence of lost (denoted by x) and\n            received (denoted by r) packets.\n\
    \         r r r x r r x x x r x r r x x x\n   Then, with `i' assigned as follows,\n\
    \                               1 1 1 1 1 1\n   i:      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0\
    \ 1 2 3 4 5\n   f(P_i) is,\n   f(P_i): 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1\n     \
    \ and there are four loss periods in the above sequence beginning at\n      P_3,\
    \ P_6, P_10, and P_13.\n"

    \ distance between\n   the lost packet and the previously lost packet.  The sample\

    \ one.  The loss distance associated with the very first packet loss is\n   considered\
    \ to be zero.\n   The sequence number of a test packet can be derived from the\n\
    \   timeseries sample collected by performing the loss measurement\n   according\
    \ to the methodology in [1].  For example, if a loss sample\n   consists of <T0,0>,\

  contents:
  - "6.1. Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Noticeable-Rate\n   Define loss of a packet to be \"\
    noticeable\" [7] if the distance\n   between the lost packet and the previously\
    \ lost packet is no greater\n   than delta, a positive integer, where delta is\
    \ the \"loss constraint\".\n   Example:  Let delta = 99.  Let us assume that packet\
    \ 50 is lost\n   followed by a bursty loss of length 3 starting from packet 125.\
    \  All\n   the three losses starting from packet 125 are noticeable.\n   Given\
    \ a Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Distance-Stream, this statistic can be\n   computed simply\
    \ as the number of losses that violate some constraint\n   delta, divided by the\
    \ number of losses.  (Alternatively, it can also\n   be defined as the number\
    \ of \"noticeable losses\" to the number of\n   successfully received packets).\
    \  This statistic is useful when the\n   actual distance between successive losses\
    \ is important.  For example,\n   many multimedia codecs can sustain losses by\
    \ \"concealing\" the effect\n   of loss by making use of past history information.\
    \  Their ability to\n   do so degrades with poor history resulting from losses\
    \ separated by\n   close distances.  By choosing delta based on this sensitivity,\
    \ one\n   can measure how \"noticeable\" a loss might be for quality purposes.\n\
    \   The noticeable loss requires a certain \"spread factor\" for losses in\n \
    \  the timeseries.  In the above example where loss constraint is equal\n   to\
    \ 99, a loss rate of one percent with a spread of 100 between losses\n   (e.g.,\
    \ 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 out of 500 packets) may be more\n   desirable for some\
    \ applications compared to the same loss rate with a\n   spread that violates\
    \ the loss constraint (e.g., 100, 175, 275, 290,\n   400:  losses occurring at\
    \ 175 and 290 violate delta = 99).\n"

  contents:
  - "6.2. Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-Total\n   This represents the total number of\
    \ loss periods, and can be derived\n   from the loss period metric Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-Stream\
    \ as\n   follows:\n   Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-Total = maximum value of the\
    \ first entry\n   of the set of pairs, <loss period, loss>, representing the loss\n\
    \   metric Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-Stream.\n   Note that this statistic does\
    \ not describe the duration of each loss\n   period itself.  If this statistic\
    \ is large, it does not mean that the\n   losses are more spread out than they\
    \ are otherwise; one or more loss\n   periods may include bursty losses.  This\
    \ statistic is generally\n   useful in gathering first order approximation of\
    \ loss spread.\n"
- title: 6.3. Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-Lengths
  contents:
  - "6.3. Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-Lengths\n   This statistic is a sequence of pairs\
    \ <loss period, length>, with the\n   \"loss period\" entry ranging from 1 - Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-\n\
    \   Total.  Thus the total number of pairs in this statistic equals\n   Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-Total.\
    \  In each pair, the \"length\" is\n   obtained by counting the number of pairs,\
    \ <loss period, loss>, in the\n   metric Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-Stream which\
    \ have their first entry\n   equal to \"loss period.\"\n   Since this statistic\
    \ represents the number of packets lost in each\n   loss period, it is an indicator\
    \ of burstiness of each loss period.\n   In conjunction with loss-period-total\
    \ statistic, this statistic is\n   generally useful in observing which loss periods\
    \ are potentially more\n   influential than others from a quality perspective.\n"
- title: 6.4. Type-P-One-Way-Inter-Loss-Period-Lengths
  contents:
  - "6.4. Type-P-One-Way-Inter-Loss-Period-Lengths\n   This statistic measures distance\
    \ between successive loss periods.  It\n   takes the form of a set of pairs <loss\
    \ period, inter-loss-period-\n   length>, with the \"loss period\" entry ranging\
    \ from 1 - Type-P-One-\n   Way-Loss-Period-Total, and \"inter-loss-period-length\"\
    \ is the loss\n   distance between the last packet considered lost in \"loss period\"\
    \n   'i-1', and the first packet considered lost in \"loss period\" 'i',\n   where\
    \ 'i' ranges from 2 to Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-Total.  The\n   \"inter-loss-period-length\"\
    \ associated with the first \"loss period\" is\n   defined to be zero.\n   This\
    \ statistic allows one to consider, for example, two loss periods\n   each of\
    \ length greater than one (implying loss burst), but separated\n   by a distance\
    \ of 2 to belong to the same loss burst if such a\n   consideration is deemed\
    \ useful.  When the Inter-Loss-Period-Length\n   between two bursty loss periods\
    \ is smaller, it could affect the loss\n   concealing ability of multimedia codecs\
    \ since there is relatively\n   smaller history.  When it is larger, an application\
    \ may be able to\n   rebuild its history which could dampen the effect of an impending\n\
    \   loss (period).\n"
- title: 6.5. Examples
  contents:
  - "6.5. Examples\n   We continue with the same example as in Section 5.4.3.  The\
    \ three\n   statistics defined above will have the following values.\n   -  Let\
    \ delta = 2.  In Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Distance-Stream\n         {<0,0>,<0,1>,<0,0>,<0,0>,<3,1>,<0,0>,<2,1>,<0,0>,<2,1>,<1,1>},\n\
    \      there are 3 loss distances that violate the delta of 2.  Thus,\n      Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Noticeable-Rate\
    \ = 3/5 ((number of noticeable\n      losses)/(number of total losses))\n   -\
    \  In Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-Stream\n         {<0,0>,<1,1>,<0,0>,<0,0>,<2,1>,<0,0>,<3,1>,<0,0>,<4,1>,<4,1>},\n\
    \      the largest of the first entry in the sequence of <loss\n      period,loss>\

    \   the lengths of individual loss periods are 1, 1, 1 and 2\n      respectively.\
    \  Thus,\n      Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-Lengths =\n         {<1,1>,<2,1>,<3,1>,<4,2>}\n\
    \   -  In Type-P-One-Way-Loss-Period-Stream\n         {<0,0>,<1,1>,<0,0>,<0,0>,<2,1>,<0,0>,<3,1>,<0,0>,<4,1>,<4,1>},\n\
    \      the loss periods 1 and 2 are separated by 3 (5-2), loss periods 2\n   \
    \   and 3 are separated by 2 (7-5), and 3 and 4 are separated by 2\n      (9-7).\
    \  Thus, Type-P-One-Way-Inter-Loss-Period-Lengths =\n         {<1,0>,<2,3>,<3,2>,<4,2>}\n"

  contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   Conducting Internet measurements raises both security\
    \ and privacy\n   concerns.  This document does not specify a particular implementation\n\
    \   of metrics, so it does not directly affect the security of the\n   Internet\
    \ nor of applications which run on the Internet.  However,\n   implementations\
    \ of these metrics must be mindful of security and\n   privacy concerns.\n   The\
    \ derived sample metrics in this document are based on the loss\n   metric defined\
    \ in RFC 2680 [1], and thus they inherit the security\n   considerations of that\
    \ document.  The reader should consult [1] for a\n   more detailed treatment of\
    \ security considerations.  Nevertheless,\n   there are a few things to highlight.\n"

  - "7.1. Denial of Service Attacks\n   The lambda specified in the Type-P-Loss-Distance-Stream\
    \ and Type-P-\n   Loss-Period-Stream controls the rate at which test packets are\
    \ sent,\n   and therefore if it is set inappropriately large, it could perturb\n\
    \   the network under test, cause congestion, or at worst be a denial-\n   of-service\
    \ attack to the network under test.  Legitimate measurements\n   must have their\
    \ parameters selected carefully in order to avoid\n   interfering with normal\
    \ traffic in the network.\n"
- title: 7.2. Privacy / Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "7.2. Privacy / Confidentiality\n   Privacy of user data is not a concern, since\
    \ the underlying metric is\n   intended to be implemented using test packets that\

    \ the derived\n   metrics do not release data sent by the user.\n"
- title: 7.3. Integrity
  contents:

    \ the\n   underlying stream, for example adding extra packets that look just\n\
    \   like test packets.  To ensure that test packets are valid and have\n   not\
    \ been altered during transit, packet authentication and integrity\n   checks,\
