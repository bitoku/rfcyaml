Abstract This memo defines an extension to the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol based (TCP/IP) internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing the frame relay service.
This document obsoletes RFC 1604.
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].
A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [16].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
These objects are used to manage a frame relay Service.
At present, this applies to the following value of the ifType variable in the IF MIB [26]:
This section provides an overview and background of how to use this MIB and other potential MIBs to manage a frame relay service.
The Frame Relay Service MIB supports Customer Network Management (CNM) of a frame relay network service.
Through the use of this and other related MIBs, a frame relay service customer's NMS can monitor the customer's UNI/NNI logical ports and PVCs.
It provides customers with access to configuration data, performance monitoring information, and fault detection for the delivered frame relay service.
As an option, an SNMP agent supporting the Frame Relay Service MIB may allow customer initiated PVC management operations such as creation, deletion, modification, activation, and deactivation of individual PVCs.
However, internal aspects of the network (e.g., switching elements, line cards, and network routing tables) are beyond the scope of this MIB.
The Frame Relay Service MIB models all interfaces and PVCs delivered by a frame relay service within a single virtual SNMP system for the purpose of comprehensively representing the customer's frame relay service.
The customer's interfaces and PVCs may physically exist on one or more devices within the network topology.
An SNMP agent providing support for the Frame Relay Service MIB as well as other appropriate MIBs to model a single virtual frame relay network service is referred to as a Frame Relay Service (FRS) agent.
Internal communication mechanisms between the FRS agent and individual devices within the frame relay network delivering the service are implementation specific and beyond the scope of this MIB.
The customer's NMS will typically access the SNMP agent implementing the Frame Relay Service MIB over a frame relay permanent virtual connection (PVC).
SNMP access over a frame relay PVC is achieved through the use of SNMP over UDP over IP encapsulated in Frame Relay according to STD 55, RFC2427 and ITU X.36 Annex D [23].
Alternate access mechanisms and SNMP agent implementations are possible.
This MIB will NOT be implemented on user equipment (e.g., DTE).
Such devices are managed using the Frame Relay DTE MIB (RFC2115[18]).
However, concentrators may use the Frame Relay Service MIB instead of the Frame Relay DTE MIB.
This MIB does not define managed objects for the physical layer.
Existing physical layer MIBs (e.g., DS1 MIB) and Interface MIB will be used as needed in FRS Agent implementations.
This MIB supports frame relay PVCs.
This MIB may be extended at a later time to handle frame relay SVCs.
A switch implementation may support this MIB for the purpose of configuration and control of the frame relay service beyond the scope of traditional customer network management applications.
A number of objects (e.g. frLportTypeAdmin) support administrative actions that impact the operation of frame relay switch equipment in the network.
This is reflected in the differences between the two MIB compliance modules:  the frame relay service compliance module (frnetservCompliance), and  the frame relay switch compliance module (frnetSwitchCompliance).
The frame relay service compliance module does not support the administrative control objects used for switch management.
Transiting Multiple Frame Relay Networks
This MIB is only used to manage a single frame relay service offering from one network service provider.
Therefore, if a customer PVC traverses multiple networks, then the customer must poll a different FRS agent within each frame relay network to retrieve the end to end view of service.
Figure 1 illustrates a customer ("User B")
NMS accessing FRS agents in three different frame relay networks (I, J, and K).
A frame relay network is shared amongst many frame relay subscribers.
Each subscriber will only have access to their information (e.g., information with respect to their interfaces and PVCs).
The FRS agent should provide instance level granularity for MIB views.
Frame Relay Service MIB Terminology Access Channel
An access channel generically refers to the DS1/E1 or DS3/E3 based UNI access channel or NNI access channel across which frame relay data transits.
An access channel is the access pathway for a single stream of user data.
Within a given DS1 line, an access channel can denote any one of the following:
the entire DS1 line is considered an access channel.
Each access channel is comprised of 24 DS0 time slots.
an access channel is any one of 24 channels.
Each access channel is comprised of a single DS0 time slot.
an access channel is a grouping of NxDS0 time slots (NX56/64 Kbps, where N   1 23 DS0 Time slots per Fractional DS1 Access Channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or non consecutive order.
Within a given E1 line, a channel can denote any one of the following:
the entire E1 line is considered a single access channel.
Each access channel is comprised of 31 E1 time slots.
an access channel is any one of 31 channels.
Each access channel is comprised of a single E1 time slot.
an access channel is a grouping of N E1 time slots (NX64 Kbps, where N   1 30 E1 time slots per FE1 access channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or non consecutive order.
Within a given unformatted line, the entire unformatted line is considered an access channel.
Examples include RS 232, V.35, V.36 and X.21 (non switched), and unframed E1 (G.703 without G.704).
The data rate of the access channel, expressed in bits/second.
The speed of the user access channel determines how rapidly the end user can inject data into the network.
Bc The Committed Burst Size (Bc) is the maximum amount of subscriber data (expressed in bits) that the network agrees to transfer, under normal conditions, during a time interval Tc.
Be The Excess Burst Size (Be) is the maximum amount of subscriber data (expressed in bits) in excess of Bc that the network will attempt to deliver during the time interval Tc.
This data (Be) is delivered in general with a lower probability than Bc.
The Committed Information Rate (CIR) is the subscriber data rate (expressed in bits/second) that the network commits to deliver under normal network conditions.
CIR is averaged over the time interval Tc (CIR   Bc/Tc).
DLCI Data Link Connection Identifier Logical Port
This term is used to model the frame relay "interface" on a device.
NNI Network to Network Interface
A virtual connection that has its end points and bearer capabilities defined at subscription time.
An octet within the 256 bit information field in each E1 frame is defined as a time slot.
Time slots are position sensitive within the 256 bit information field.
Fractional E1 service is provided in contiguous or non contiguous time slot increments.
An octet within the 192 bit information field in each DS1 frame is defined as a time slot.
Time slots are position sensitive within the 192 bit information field.
Fractional DS1 service is provided in contiguous or non contiguous time slot increments.
UNI User to Network Interface N391
Full status (status of all PVCs)
polling counter N392 Error threshold N393 Monitored events count T391 Link integrity verification polling timer
Maximum status enquiry counter 2.5.
Relation to Other MIBs 2.5.1.
System Group Use the System Group of the SNMPv2 MIB [27] to describe the Frame Relay Service (FRS) agent.
The FRS agent may be monitoring many frame relay devices in one network.
The System Group does not describe frame relay devices monitored by the FRS agent.
ASCII string describing the FRS agent.
Can be up to 255 characters long.
This field is generally used to indicate the network providers identification and type of service offered.
Unique OBJECT IDENTIFIER (OID) for the FRS agent.
sysUpTime:  Clock in the FRS agent; TimeTicks in 1/100s of a second.
Elapsed type since the FRS agent came on line.
Contact for the FRS agent.
ASCII string of up to 255 characters.
sysName:  Domain name of the FRS agent, for example, acme.com sysLocation:  Location of the FRS agent.
ASCII string of up to 255 characters.
sysServices:  Services of the managed device.
The value "2", which implies that the frame relay network is providing a subnetwork level service, is recommended.
This specifies how the Interfaces Group defined in the IF MIB [26] shall be used for the management of frame relay based interfaces, and in conjunction with the Frame Relay Service MIB module.
This memo assumes the interpretation of the evolution of the Interfaces group to be in accordance with: "The interfaces table (ifTable) contains information on the managed resource's interfaces.
Each sub layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface is considered an interface."
Thus, the ifTable allows the following frame relay based interfaces to be represented as table entries:  Frame relay interfaces in equipment (e.g., switches, routers or networks) supporting frame relay.
This level is concerned with generic frame counts and not with individual virtual connections.
In accordance with the guidelines of ifTable, frame counts per virtual connection are not covered by ifTable, and are considered interface specific and covered in the Frame Relay Service MIB module.
In order to interrelate the ifEntries properly, the Interfaces Stack Group shall be supported.
Some specific interpretations of ifTable for frame relay follow.
Each frame relay port is represented by an ifEntry.
ASCII string describing the UNI/NNI logical port.
Can be up to 255 characters long.
The value allocated for Frame Relay Service is equal to 44.
This could be the speed of the logical port and not the access rate.
Actual user information transfer rate (i.e., access rate) of the UNI or NNI logical port in bits per second (this is not the clocking speed).
For example, it is 1,536,000 bits per second for a DS1 based UNI/NNI logical port and 1,984,000 bits per second for an E1 based UNI/NNI logical port.
The primary address for this logical port assigned by the frame relay interface provider.
An octet string of zero length if no address is used for this logical port.
The desired administrative status of the frame relay logical port.
The current operational status of the Frame Relay UNI or NNI logical port.
The value of sysUptime at the last re initialization of the logical port.
The value of sysUpTime at the time the logical port entered its current operational state.
If the current state was entered prior to the last re initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
The number of received octets.
This counter only counts octets from the beginning of the frame relay header field to the end of user data.
The number of received unerrored, unicast frames.
The number of received frames discarded.
Specifically, frames discarded due to ingress buffer congestion and traffic policing.
The number of received frames that are discarded because of an error.
Specifically, frames that are too long or too short, frames that are not a multiple of 8 bits in length, frames with an invalid or unrecognized DLCI, frames with an abort sequence, frames with improper flag delimitation, and frame that fail FCS.
The number of packets discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.
For Frame Relay Service interfaces, this counter will always be zero.
The number of transmitted octets.
This counter only counts octets from the beginning of the frame relay header field to the end of user data.
The number of unerrored, unicast frames sent.
The number of frames discarded in the egress direction.
Possible reasons are as follows: policing, congestion.
The number of frames discarded in the egress direction because of an error.
Specifically, frames that are aborted due to a transmitter underrun.
This variable is not applicable for Frame Relay Service interfaces, therefore, this variable contains a zero length string.
The number of received unerrored, multicast frames.
This variable is not applicable for Frame Relay Service interfaces, therefore, this counter is always zero.
The number of sent unerrored, multicast frames.
This variable is not applicable for Frame Relay Service interfaces, therefore, this counter is always zero.
The number of received octets.
This counter only counts octets from the beginning of the frame relay header field to the end of user data.
The number of transmitted octets.
This counter only counts octets from the beginning of the frame relay header field to the end of user data.
It is recommended that the underlying physical layer notifications be disabled since both are not required.
Notifications are enabled at the frame relay service layer specifically because PVC notifications are not to be sent if the frame relay interface fails.
Without a linkUp/linkDown notification, the management station would receive no notification of the failure.
If the user data rate is less than 1 Mbps, then this value is zero.
Frame relay network service interfaces support the Interface Stack Group.
Frame relay network service interfaces do not support any other groups or objects in the Interfaces group of the IF MIB.
Stack Table for DS1/E1 Environment
This section describes by example how to use ifStackTable to represent the relationship of frame relay service to ds0 and ds0Bundles with ds1 interfaces [20].
Example: A frame relay service is being carried on 4 ds0s of a ds1.
The assignment of the index values could for example be:
The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the various interfaces.
In the case where the frame relay service is using a single ds0, then the ds0Bundle is not required.
The assignment of the index values could for example be:
The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the various interfaces.
Stack Table for V.35 Environments
This section describes by example how to use ifStackTable to represent the relationship of frame relay service with V.35 interfaces.
An example of index values in this case could be:
(RS232 like MIB) is used instead of type 45 (V.35).
V35 does not pertain to this environment.
The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the various interfaces.
The Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service Interworking MIB Connections between two frame relay endpoints are represented with an entry in the frPVCConnectTable of this MIB.
Both endpoints are represented with rows in the frPVCEndptTable.
The frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier object of each endpoint points to the frPVCConnectTable cross connect table row for the connection.
In contrast, a connection that spans frame relay and ATM endpoints is represented with an entry in the frAtmIwfConnectionTable of the FR/ATM PVC Service
Interworking MIB defined in [28].
In the case of an inter worked connection, the frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier object is set to zero.
Instead, the frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex object is set to the index of the FR/ATM IWF
The frame relay PVC cross connect table (frPVCConnectTable)
does not contain an entry for the FR/ATM inter worked connection.
Textual Convention Change Version 1 of the Frame Relay Service MIB contains MIB objects defined with the DisplayString textual convention.
In version 2 of this MIB, the syntax for these objects has been updated to use the (now preferred)
The new TC provides support for a greater variety of international character sets.
The working group realizes that this change is not strictly supported by SMIv2.
In our judgment, the alternative of deprecating the old objects and defining new objects would have a more adverse impact on backward compatibility and interoperability, given the particular semantics of these objects.

This table is used to model a PVC end point.
This table contains the traffic parameters and statistics for a PVC end point.
This table is used to identify the traffic parameters for a bi directional PVC segment end  point, and it also provides statistics for a PVC segment end point.
A PVC segment end point is identified by a UNI/NNI logical port index value and DLCI index value.

"The Frame Relay PVC Connect Table is used to model the bi directional PVC segment flows including:  point to point PVCs, point to  multipoint PVCs, and multipoint to multipoint PVCs.
This table has read create access and is used to associate PVC end points together as belonging to one connection.
The frPVCConnectIndex is used to associate all the bi directional flows.
Not all implementations will support the capability of creating/modifying/deleting PVCs using SNMP as a feature of frame relay CNM service.
Once the entries in the frPVCEndptTable are created, the following step are used to associate the PVC end points as belonging to one PVC connection: 1)  Obtain a unique frPVCConnectIndex using the frPVCConnectIndexValue object.
Connect the PVC segment endpoints together with the applicable frPVCConnectIndex value obtained via  frPVCConnectIndexValue.
The entries in this table are created by using the frPVCConnectRowStatus object.
The agent will provide the value of the corresponding instances of frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier with the frPVCConnectIndex value.
Set frPVCConnectAdminStatus to `active(1)' in all rows for this PVC segment to turn the PVC on.
For example, the Frame Relay PVC Connection Group models a bi directional, point to point PVC segment as one entry in this table.
> from low to high PVC flow
<< from high to low PVC flow  <<
The terms low and high are chosen to represent numerical ordering of a PVC segment's endpoints for representation in this table.
That is, the endpoint with the lower value of ifIndex is termed 'low', while the opposite endpoint of the segment is termed 'high'.
This terminology is to provide directional information; for example the frPVCConnectL2hOperStatus and frPVCConnectH2lOperStatus as illustrated above.
If the Frame Relay Connection table is used to model a unidirectional PVC, then one direction (either from low to high or from high to low) has its Operational Status equal to down.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
No managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information.
by itself is not a secure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View based Access Control Model RFC 2575
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The changes from RFC 1604 are the following:
(1)  Added the object frLportDLCIIndexValue to automatically generate index values for new DLC rows.
(2)  Add the following objects to support manager writing to objects:
Logical Port Objects frLportTypeAdmin frLportVCSigProtocolAdmin VC Objects frMgtVCSigProcedAdmin

(3)  Add objects to control fragmentation:
frLportFragControl frLportFragSize (4)  Added objects to track frames offered to network (in) and delivered (out) for increased visibility into policing driven discards, congestion driven discards, DE bit setting, and congestion bit setting:
frPVCEndptOutDECongDiscards frPVCEndptOutDEFrames (5)  Added the PVC object frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex
to identify the type of connection, frame relay or ATM IWF; and to identify the cross connect row of the FR/ATM IWF MIB.
(6)  Added objects to provide printable names of the connection user and service provider:
(7)  Added a new notification to correct flaws in the RFC1604 trap.

(10) Changed references to "proxy agent" to "FRS agent" to avoid confusion with other proxy agent terminology.
Changed objects using the DisplayString TC to use the SnmpAdminString TC.
(12) frMgtVCSigProced Expanded to include the u2nuser(3) enumeration for the UNI protocol operation where the logical port operates in the user role.
(13) DESCRIPTION text added to specify agent response when object is not instantiated  for the following objects: frMgtVCSigUserN391 frMgtVCSigUserN393 frMgtVCSigUserT391 frMgtVCSigUserN392 frMgtVCSigNetN391 frMgtVCSigNetN393 frMgtVCSigNetT391 frMgtVCSigNetN392
DESCRIPTION text addressing case of logical port not performing network side procedures was removed from following objects:
