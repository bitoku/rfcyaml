- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) includes a\
    \ method\n   [RFC7484] that can be used to identify the authoritative server for\n\
    \   processing domain name, IP address, and Autonomous System Number\n   (ASN)\
    \ queries.  This method works because each of these data elements\n   is structured\
    \ in a way that facilitates automated parsing of the\n   element and association\
    \ of the data element with a particular RDAP\n   service provider.  For example,\
    \ domain names include labels (such as\n   \"com\", \"net\", and \"org\") that\
    \ are associated with specific service\n   providers.\n   As noted in Section\
    \ 9 of RFC 7484 [RFC7484], the method does not\n   describe how to identify the\
    \ authoritative server for processing\n   entity queries, name server queries,\
    \ help queries, or queries using\n   certain search patterns.  This limitation\
    \ exists because the\n   identifiers bound to these queries are typically not\
    \ structured in a\n   way that makes it easy to associate an identifier with a\
    \ specific\n   service provider.  This document describes an operational practice\n\
    \   that can be used to add structure to RDAP identifiers and makes it\n   possible\
    \ to identify the authoritative server for additional RDAP\n   queries.\n   The\
    \ key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\
    \   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ BCP\n   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals,\
    \ as shown here.\n"
- title: 2.  Object Naming Practice
  contents:
  - "2.  Object Naming Practice\n   Tagging object identifiers with a service provider\
    \ tag makes it\n   possible to identify the authoritative server for processing\
    \ an RDAP\n   query using the method described in RFC 7484 [RFC7484].  A service\n\
    \   provider tag is constructed by prepending the Unicode HYPHEN-MINUS\n   character\
    \ \"-\" (U+002D, described as an \"unreserved\" character in RFC\n   3986 [RFC3986])\
    \ to an IANA-registered value that represents the\n   service provider.  For example,\
    \ a tag for a service provider\n   identified by the string value \"ARIN\" is\
    \ represented as \"-ARIN\".\n   In combination with the rdapConformance attribute\
    \ described in\n   Section 4, service provider tags are concatenated to the end\
    \ of RDAP\n   query object identifiers to unambiguously identify the authoritative\n\
    \   server for processing an RDAP query.  Building on the example from\n   Section\
    \ 3.1.5 of RFC 7482 [RFC7482], an RDAP entity handle can be\n   constructed to\
    \ allow an RDAP client to bootstrap an entity query.\n   The following identifier\
    \ is used to find information for the entity\n   associated with handle \"XXXX\"\
    \ at service provider \"ARIN\":\n      XXXX-ARIN\n   Clients that wish to bootstrap\
    \ an entity query can parse this\n   identifier into distinct handle and service\
    \ provider identifier\n   elements.  Handles can themselves contain HYPHEN-MINUS\
    \ characters;\n   the service provider identifier is found following the last\
    \ HYPHEN-\n   MINUS character in the tagged identifier.  The service provider\n\
    \   identifier is used to retrieve a base RDAP URL from an IANA registry.\n  \
    \ The base URL and entity handle are then used to form a complete RDAP\n   query\
    \ path segment.  For example, if the base RDAP URL\n   \"https://example.com/rdap/\"\
    \ is associated with service provider\n   \"YYYY\" in an IANA registry, an RDAP\
    \ client will parse a tagged entity\n   identifier \"XXXX-YYYY\" into distinct\
    \ handle (\"XXXX\") and service\n   provider (\"YYYY\") identifiers.  The service\
    \ provider identifier\n   \"YYYY\" is used to query an IANA registry to retrieve\
    \ the base RDAP\n   URL \"https://example.com/rdap/\".  The RDAP query URL is\
    \ formed using\n   the base RDAP URL and entity path segment described in Section\
    \ 3.1.5\n   of RFC 7482 [RFC7482] and using \"XXXX-YYY\" as the value of the handle\n\
    \   identifier.  The complete RDAP query URL becomes\n   \"https://example.com/rdap/entity/XXXX-YYYY\"\
    .\n   Implementation of this practice requires tagging of unstructured\n   potential\
    \ query identifiers in RDAP responses.  Consider these elided\n   examples (\"\
    ...\" is used to note elided response objects) from\n   Section 5.3 of RFC 7483\
    \ [RFC7483] in which the handle identifiers\n   have been tagged with service\
    \ provider tags \"RIR\", \"DNR\", and \"ABC\",\n   respectively:\n   {\n     \"\

    \ As described in Section 5 of RFC 7483 [RFC7483], RDAP responses can\n   contain\
    \ \"self\" links.  Service provider tags and self references\n   SHOULD be consistent.\
    \  If they are inconsistent, the service provider\n   tag is processed with higher\
    \ priority when using these values to\n   identify a service provider.\n   There\
    \ is a risk of unpredictable processing behavior if the HYPHEN-\n   MINUS character\
    \ is used for naturally occurring, non-separator\n   purposes in an entity handle.\
    \  This could lead to a client mistakenly\n   assuming that a HYPHEN-MINUS character\
    \ represents a separator and\n   that the text that follows HYPHEN-MINUS is a\
    \ service provider\n   identifier.  A client that queries the IANA registry for\
    \ what they\n   assume is a valid service provider will likely receive an unexpected,\n\
    \   invalid result.  As a consequence, use of the HYPHEN-MINUS character\n   as\
    \ a service provider tag separator MUST be noted by adding an\n   rdapConformance\
    \ value to query responses as described in Section 4.\n   The HYPHEN-MINUS character\
    \ was chosen as a separator for two reasons:\n   1) it is a familiar separator\
    \ character in operational use, and 2) it\n   avoids collision with URI-reserved\
    \ characters.  The list of\n   unreserved characters specified in Section 2.3\
    \ of RFC 3986 [RFC3986]\n   provided multiple options for consideration:\n   \
    \   unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\"\n   ALPHA and DIGIT\
    \ characters were excluded because they are commonly\n   used in entity handles\
    \ for non-separator purposes.  HYPHEN-MINUS is\n   commonly used as a separator,\
    \ and recognition of this practice will\n   reduce implementation requirements\
    \ and operational risk.  The\n   remaining characters were excluded because they\
    \ are not broadly used\n   as separators in entity handles.\n"

    \ by IANA and provides integrity protection for the\n   resulting referral information,\
    \ as well as provides privacy\n   protection via data confidentiality.  The subsequent\
