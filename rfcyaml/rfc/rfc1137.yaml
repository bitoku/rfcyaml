- title: Status of this Memo
  contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This RFC suggests an electronic mail protocol mapping\
    \ for the\n   Internet community and UK Academic Community, and requests discussion\n\
    \   and suggestions for improvements.  This memo does not specify an\n   Internet\
    \ standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n   This document describes\
    \ a set of address mappings which will enable\n   interworking between systems\
    \ operating RFC 822 protocols in a general\n   manner, and those environments\
    \ where transfer of RFC 822 messages\n   restricts the character set which can\
    \ be used in addresses.  UUCP\n   transfer of RFC 822 messages is an important\
    \ case of this\n   [Crocker82a, Horton86a].\n"
- title: Specification
  contents:
  - "Specification\n   This document specifies a mapping between two protocols.  This\n\
    \   specification should be used when this mapping is performed on the\n   Internet\
    \ or in the UK Academic Community. This specification may be\n   modified in the\
    \ light of implementation experience, but no\n   substantial changes are expected.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Some mail networks which use RFC 822 cannot support the\
    \ full\n   character set required by all aspects of RFC 822.  This document\n\
    \   describes a symmetrical mapping between full RFC 822 addressing, and\n   a\
    \ form for use on these networks.  Any addresses within the networks\n   will\
    \ not use the full RFC 822 addressing, and so any addresses\n   encoded according\
    \ to this standard will always represent remote\n   addresses.  This document\
    \ derives from a mapping originally specified\n   in RFC 987 [Kille86a], where\
    \ the domain of application was more\n   restricted.  Two terms are now defined:\n\
    \   Full RFC 822\n      This implies full support for transfer to and from any\
    \ legal RFC\n      822 address.  In particular, the quoted-string form of local-part\n\
    \      must be supported (e.g., <\"Joe Soap\"@foo.bar>).\n   Restricted RFC 822\n\
    \      This implies a subset of RFC 822 addressing.  The quoted-string\n     \
    \ form of local-part need not be supported.  Standard UUCP mail\n      transfer\
    \ falls into this category.  Restricted RFC 822 is\n      undesirable, but in\
    \ practice it exists in many places.\n      When a message is transferred from\
    \ full RFC 822 to restricted RFC\n      822, and address forms used in full RFC\
    \ 822 are involved, message\n      loss may occur (e.g., it may not be possible\
    \ to return an error\n      message).  This RFC describes a quoting mechanism\
    \ which may be\n      used to map between full RFC 822 and restricted RFC 822,\
    \ in order\n      to alleviate this problem.\n"
- title: 2.  Encoding
  contents:
  - "2.  Encoding\n   The RFC 822 EBNF meta notation is used.  Any EBNF definitions\
    \ taken\n   from RFC 822 are prefixed by the string \"822.\".\n   The following\
    \ EBNF is specified.\n      atom-encoded    = *( a-char / a-encoded-char )\n \
    \     a-char          = <any CHAR except specials (other than \"@\"\n        \
    \                      and \".\"), SPACE,\n                              CTL,\
    \ \"_\", and \"#\">\n      a-encoded-char  = \"_\"                   ; (space)\n\
    \                      / \"#u#\"                 ; (_)\n                     \
    \ / \"#l#\"                 ; <(>\n                      / \"#r#\"           \
    \      ; <)>\n                      / \"#m#\"                 ; (,)\n        \
    \              / \"#c#\"                 ; (:)\n                      / \"#b#\"\
    \                 ; (\\)\n                      / \"#h#\"                 ; (#)\n\
    \                      / \"#e#\"                 ; (=)\n                     \
    \ / \"#s#\"                 ; (/)\n                      / \"#\" 3DIGIT \"#\"\n\
    \   The 822.3DIGIT in EBNF.a-encoded-char must have range 0-127, and is\n   interpreted\
    \ in decimal as the corresponding ASCII character.  The\n   choice of special\
    \ abbreviations (as opposed to decimal encoding)\n   provided is based on the\
    \ manner in which this mapping is most\n   frequently used.  There are special\
    \ encodings for each of the\n   PrintableString characters not in EBNF.a-char,\
    \ except \".\".  Space is\n   given a single character encoding, due to its (expected)\
    \ frequency of\n   use, and backslash as the RFC 822 single quote character.\n\
    \   This mapping is used to transform between the two forms of 822.word:\n   822.quoted-string\
    \ (restricted RFC 822) and 822.atom (restricted RFC\n   822).  To encode (full\
    \ RFC 822 -> restricted RFC 822), first remove\n   any quoting from any 822.quoted-string.\
    \  Then, all EBNF.a-char are\n   used directly and all other CHAR are encoded\
    \ as EBNF.a-encoded-char.\n   To decode (restricted RFC 822 -> full RFC 822):\
    \ if the address can be\n   parsed as EBNF.encoded-atom reverse the previous mapping.\
    \  If it\n   cannot be so parsed, map the characters directly.\n"
